This could be attributed to the growing demand for high-specification multiple-user factories, as occupiers look for office grade industrial spaces near the city fringe. Demand for factories has also been supported by continued growth in the food, electronics and precision engineering industries. Backed by strong government support and incentives, more firms are expected to set up their manufacturing hubs in Singapore, with sustained growth in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors to underpin demand for factory space. 2 All Industrial Property Both the JTC all Industrial price and rental indices continued their seventh consecutive quarter of growth in Q2 2022; the rental index rose by 1.5% QOQ, accelerating from its 1.0% growth in the previous quarter as demand caught up with supply. On the other hand, the price index rose by 1.5% QOQ this quarter, easing from the 3.1% QOQ growth last quarter. Warehouse On the back of strong leasing activity, occupancy for private warehouses further tightened to 91.4% from 90.9% in the previous quarter. Although warehouse rents increased by 2.1% QOQ overall, rental performance would vary across different warehouses, depending on their location and specifications. Specifically for prime logistics (investor grade ramp-up warehouses), where vacancy rates remain tight and pre- commitment rates to upcoming supply are high, rental growth has outperformed, and there will continue to be healthy rental growth on the back of strong demand. Business Parks With the increase in business park stock, occupancy has dropped by 50 pp this quarter. Business parks rents have started to exhibit some growth (0.2% QOQ), on the back of higher demand from knowledge and high-value sectors such as technology and biomedical firms. Rental growth is likely to be skewed towards newer, higher specification developments in the city fringe as these are preferred by tenants.

However, with an average annual supply of about 12.9 mil sf till 2025 coming onstream (compared to 7.5 mil sf over the past three years), and with 16.8 mil sf to be completed this year, the higher supply is likely to temper the pace of rental and price growth. On one hand, macroeconomic uncertainties are prompting industrialists to fortify their supply chains by diversifying locations and stockpiling; on the other, it has also led them to be more cautious about their expansion plans. Other risks which could dampen business sentiments in the industrial sector include rising commodity prices, disruptions to global supply chains, slowing growth and higher cost of capital due to rising interest rates in developed economies, as well as the resurgence of renewed pandemic outbreaks which may reintroduce restrictions and further disrupt supply chains and labour supply. In the long term, demand for industrial space will still be driven by tailwinds such as Singapore's increasing focus on higher-value manufacturing and biomedical sectors. Therefore, Colliers expects rents to grow by between 2 and 4% this year. Industrial prices could grow at a higher clip of between 5 and 7% on the back of growing interest in industrial assets due to their higher yields and limited availability.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Steady Growth Expected for 2022 Despite Headwinds Official data released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in May 2022 showed that Singapore's economy expanded by 3.7% y-o-y during the first quarter of 2022, which was faster than the advance estimate of 3.4%. Manufacturing sector which grew by 7.1% y-o-y in Q2 2022, extending the 13.2% full-year growth in 2021 was the top contributor to GDP growth during the quarter. GDP growth for 2022 is expected to slow to about 3% to 5% given global economic uncertainties due to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. Broad-based Rent Growth Continues But Caution Setting in Industrial market continued to improve across most segments. While rents of business parks in both the city fringe and outlying areas as well as factory remained stable on the back of tight vacancy rates, the other segments witnessed rising rents with prime logistics continuing to outperform. A flight to quality continues to drive the market and high-tech factories continue to see demand with rents inching up slightly in Q2 2022 as occupiers seek newer office-like industrial spaces in close-to-city locations for better corporate image and talent retention. Prime logistics and warehouse rents rose 2.0% and 1.5% q-o-q respectively in Q2 2022, as tight supply continues to support rental growth. A swift re-opening of the economy is diverting consumption from goods to services, as people spend more on travel and leisure activities. With pandemic- fueled demand for goods tapering off coupled with current macro-uncertainties, e-commerce players are adopting a watch-and-wait stance. Consequently, warehouse / prime logistics rental growth may slow in the upcoming quarters amid more cautious market sentiments. However, stockpiling demand for goods and food, continues to persist, to hedge against high freight costs and supply chain disruptions. This would underpin occupancy levels for prime logistics / warehouse space, especially for developments with cold chain facilities. Steady Long-term Fundamentals to Underpin Industrial Capital Values The industrial market is still expected to lock in positive rental growth for 2022 despite looming global recession risks as Singapore economy continues to grow, driving demand for industrial space, and new supply remains tight in some segments. A flight to quality will gravitate demand for newer and better spec facilities, leading to increased incentives for redevelopment and asset enhancement, though this will be balanced against higher development costs due to higher financing and construction costs. The industrial market's fundamentals are underpinned by long-term demand from high-value manufacturing and e-commerce growth. Singapore aims to grow her manufacturing sector by 50% by 2030 and Singapore's e-commerce market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% to reach S$14.2 billion in 2025 according to forecasts by GlobalData. Also, there is limited available institutional-grade industrial stock for sale. As such, we don't anticipate much repricing in the market especially for longer tenure industrial land, even as interest rates go up as owners are likely to stick to their asking prices.

Total new supply added to the market in 1H22 was 655,000 sqm, almost on par with the 669,000 sqm added to the market for the whole of FY21. With borders now reopened and construction activity ramping up, project completions are also expected to pick up, and a further c.1.6m sqm of new industrial space is expected to come online in 2H22. Around 43% of new supply will be single-user factory space, c.30% will be multiple-user factory space, while the remaining c.27% will come from warehouses and business parks. Despite the faster pace of project completions, demand in 2Q22 continued to be robust. Although the multiple-user and warehouse segments saw the largest increase in new supply of 129,000 sqm and 109,000 sqm respectively, demand was more than sufficient to offset new stock. Both segments reported positive net absorption in 2Q22, which helped to offset the slight negative net absorption in the single-user and business parks segments. Overall occupancy rate for industrial properties inched up 0.2 ppt in 2Q22 to 90.0%. Rental index at a five-year high. On the back of higher occupancies and continued strong demand, the rental index for industrial properties has inched up to 93.7 in 2Q22. This is the highest level reported in more than five years, with the rental index at 93.8 at the end of FY16. The increase in rental index was contributed by all four segments of industrial properties which also reported an increase q-o-q. Unsurprisingly, the most significant increase in rental index in 2Q22 came from the multiple-user and warehouse segments as a result of stock take ups. Within the multiple-user factory space, the highest increases in rental index were seen in the North Region and West Region where the q-o-q index increased 3.6 ppts and 2.3 ppts, respectively. What are we watching? Delivery of new supply in FY22. As the labour crunch eases and project completion continues to ramp up, we are expecting the delivery of more stock this year. The 655,000 sqm of new supply completed in 1H22 was already almost on par with the total new supply in FY21. We understand that many of these were projects that were delayed, and we are expecting more of such projects to be completed by the end of FY22. Based on estimates from JTC, a further 1.5m sqm of new supply is projected to be delivered in 2H22, with the bulk coming from the single-user and multiple-user factory space. We are keeping a close watch on the new supply for multiple-user factories where c.470,000 sqm of stock will be added in 2H22, potentially putting pressure on occupancies and rents. Slower rate of new completions expected beyond FY22. Looking further ahead, new supply of industrial space that is projected to be completed is expected to slow down. Between FY23 and FY25, slightly less than 900,000 sqm of new stock is expected to be added to the market on an annual basis. Approximately 53% of the new stock in the next three years is single-user factory space, c.19% are multiple-user factory space, c.16% are business parks, and c.13% are warehouses. Assuming that demand continues to remain healthy, we believe that the spike in new supply in FY22 may put some pressure on rents and occupancies, but the excess supply should be gradually absorbed from FY23 onwards.

Rental Index: Rentals for industrial properties are at a 5-year high Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * The overall industrial properties rental index has been on the uptrend since late- FY20, likely due to a lack of new supply as construction delays hit. * Industrial properties rental index is currently 93.7, a level not seen since the end of FY16. The rising rental index has mostly been driven by the multiple-user factory and warehouse segments. * The multiple-user and warehouse rental indices are currently 92.2 and 89.1 respectively. The last time both rental indices were this high was in late-FY16 to early-FY17. * Single-user rental index is currently 97.8 and has been fluctuating at these levels over the past three to four years. * Business parks rental index peaked at 113.3 at the beginning of FY20 and currently hovers around 112.1, a slight improvement from the previous quarter. 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 Industrial Property Multi-User Single-User Warehouse Business Parks Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 4 .

This is a result of a rollover in project completions from the last two years as the COVID-19 pandemic led to construction delays and disruptions to supply chains. * Only 669,000sqm of new supply was completed in the whole of FY21. The remaining 784,000sqm of new stock that was previously expected to be completed in FY21 has now been pushed to FY22. * Of the remaining c.1.6m sqm of new supply expected to hit the market over the next two quarters of FY22, c.43% will be single-user factory space that has likely been developed by industrialists for their own use. * Multiple-user factory space makes up another c.30% of the upcoming supply, and warehouses and business park spaces will contribute the remaining c.27% of the new stock. * Take-up of multiple-user and warehouse spaces has been healthy so far in the first two quarters of FY22 with positive net absorption despite the delivery of new stock. However, the spike in supply for the rest of FY22 may put some pressure on occupancy and rental rates going forward. - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F 000' sqm Supply Demand Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 5 . Spike in new supply in 2022 is expected to lead to negative net absorption Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * Net absorption in FY20 and FY21 were positive due to the delays in construction and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. * Although the amount of new industrial supply in FY21 was more than twice the amount seen in FY20, pent-up demand and expansion needs led to a slightly positive net absorption in FY21. * The positive net absorption in FY21 came from the multi-user factory and warehouse segments, partially offset by the negative net absorption from the single-user factory and business park segments. * With c.2.2m sqm of new industrial supply expected to hit the market in FY22, we might see some negative net absorption. We believe that the negative net absorption will likely be contributed by the single-user and multiple-user factory segments, which are projected to deliver the bulk of the new supply this year. * In the medium term, net absorption could surprise on the upside as some construction delays persist. It may likely lead to some of the new supply in FY22 being rolled over to the following years and help spread out new stock more evenly and lessen pressure on vacancy rates. 8.1% 9.1% 9.4% 10.5% 11.1% 10.7% 10.8% 10.1% 9.8% 10.1% 10.3% 10.7% 10.8% 0.0% 2.0% 4.0% 6.0% 8.0% 10.0% 12.0% (8) (6) (4) (2) - 2 4 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F m'sqft Net Suplus/(Net deficit) Vacancy Rate (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 6 .

Positive rental reversions for business parks have been tapering off in the past two years, and was flat in FY21. * Overall rentals in the near term are expected to remain relatively healthy as construction delays continue to limit the addition of new stock to the market. * Over the last two years, the logistics sector has been driven by the advancement of e-commerce and stockpiling activities. This has led to the outperformance in rentals for the warehouse segment, and we believe its outperformance will continue through to FY23. -20% -10% 0% 10% 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F % reversions (3 year cycle) Business Park Warehouse Factory Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 7 . Industrial Sub-sector - Multi-User Factory Multi-user factory supply: Supply spike in 2022F due to construction delays in previous two years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * The drop in new completions in FY21 led to a 170bps improvement in occupancy rates, and vacancy rates fell to a low of 9.8%, a level not seen in the past nine years. * Due to further construction delays in FY21, some new supply has been rolled over to FY22. This was likely the main reason for the robust increase in occupancy rates for the multiple-user factory space, to 90.2%. * As more delays caused some new supply to be rolled over to FY22, the spike in supply for multiple-user factory space could likely lead to vacancy rates inching back up to c.11% in FY23 and FY24. * Occupancy rates could surprise on the upside in FY22 if the labour crunch situation persists and new supply is spread out more evenly over the next few years. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F m Sqft Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 8 .

GDP increased by 3.7% y-o-y thus far in the first three months of 2022, supported by the 7.1% y-o-y growth of the manufacturing sector. This was primarily led by strong output expansions within the electronics and precision engineering clusters in Q1 as global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment remained robust. Nonetheless, business sentiments have moderated. According to Singstat's Business Expectations report for the manufacturing sector, overall, a net weighted balance of +2% of manufacturing firms foresee a favourable business outlook for the period April to September 2022, lower than the preceding net weighted balance of +8% recorded in the previous quarter. As such, despite dampened business sentiments due to prolonged global uncertainties, the electronics industry continues to grow, boosting performance in the overall manufacturing sector as the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) posted an expansion of 50.3 in June 2022. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in April and May 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against January and February 2022) and y-o-y (against April and May 2021). Overall, the pace of industrial sales has slowed down. In Q2 2022, total transactions amounted to S$661.5 million, representing declines of 4.9% and 30.2% on a q-o-q and y-o-y basis respectively. Multiple-user factory spaces, posing as one of the more affordable industrial assets, continued to register healthy levels of sales, bringing the average price to S$439 psf (Exhibit 1). One of the main contributors to the demand for industrial space is the food industry, where occupiers are actively on the lookout for food factories and central kitchens in Singapore. With rising global concerns on food security, as well as access to raw materials and necessities, stockpiling activity has increased. The strengthening Singapore dollar provided support for stockpiling, mitigating escalation in costs as inflation becomes significant. The need for space to support the increase in firms' inventories expanded demand for warehouse space, evident from the 212 rental transactions recorded for such space in just April 2022 alone (Exhibit 2). Historically, this leasing volume stands as the highest number of tenancies on a monthly basis since data became available, bringing the cumulative median rental for warehouse to S$1.85 psf pm in April and May.

In April 2022, the redevelopment of Pokka's regional headquarters commenced. To be completed by Q1 2024, the new state-of-the-art building will house an innovation and incubation hub with sustainable features and facilities. More recently in May 2022, Singapore's first eco-friendly manufacturing hub, Green Lab, spanning some 200,000 sf officially opened. Envisioned to be a one-stop production plant, the facility will manufacture some of Singapore's first fully compostable plant-based bags that could potentially replace existing plastic ones. Fraser and Neave (F&N), who owns a 60% stake in Green Lab through its publishing arm, Times Publishing, will be switching the packaging of its in-house brands and products to the sustainable alternatives produced. Despite existing global and regional uncertainties, bright spots continue to highlight the industrial market. The persisting chip shortage globally will continue to generate demand for electronics, and the transport engineer- ing cluster will benefit from the increased demand for air travel as travel accelerates in many parts of the world. Thus, prices and rentals for industrial space remain on track to grow 3% to 5% for the whole of 2022. In tandem with these initiatives, JTC has also introduced solar deployment models, helping industries to transition towards sustainable and renewable energy sources through the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. To facilitate solar energy adoption, solar deployment will be mandatory for certain sites that meet the requirements set by the government agency.

This was attributed to a strong growth (5.7% YoY) in the manufacturing sector and also from the easing of local and border restrictions since April. The overall factory activity in Singapore picked up steam in Q2, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inching up from 50.1 in March to 50.3 in June. Despite headwinds such as moderation in global growth, recession risks, COVID-19 disruptions and the ongoing geopolitical tensions, the higher electronics PMI reading indicated a strong performance for the electronics industry. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) also performed well, posting a 9.0% YoY growth in June. RENTAL MARKET Leasing volume1 in Q2/2022 fell 10.4% YoY to 3,028 transactions, ending seven consecutive quarters of increase since Q3/2020. This was mainly due to fewer tenancies signed for single- and multiple-user factory segments which fell by 7.1% and 14.0% YoY respectively in Q2. The warehouse space was the only segment which recorded higher leasing numbers, rising by 7.0% YoY in Q2 (+1.8% YoY in Q1. Rising demand from ecommerce and third-party logistics (3PL) fi rms was the likely cause for this increase. Correspondingly, the vacancy level for warehouse space eased to 9.1%, the lowest since Q4/2015. Although there was a net supply of nearly 1.2 million sq ft of new warehouse spaces in Q2, it was off set by a net demand of 1.8 million sq ft. It is likely to be due to healthy demand for modern logistics spaces, which helped to lift the take-up rate of new developments such as Logos Penjuru Logistics Centre. While vacancy level for multiple-user factory space fell by 0.6 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.6% in Q2, that for single-user factory space remained fl at at 9.7%. Along with healthy demand for factory and warehouse spaces, especially those well located or modern facilities, rents continued to increase at a faster pace across all industrial segments in Q2/2022. The JTC's rental index for multiple-user factory and warehouse spaces have retraced their levels since 2016 and 2017 respectively. Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 and warehouse and logistics properties3 increased by 5.2% QoQ to S$2.00 per sq ft and 1.4% QoQ to S$1.47 per sq ft in Q2. 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 increased 28.0% QoQ to 512 transactions in Q2/2022, a level not seen since Q3/2014. Strata warehouse sales rose by 73.7% QoQ with 33 deals and multiple-user factory sales which rose by 25.3% QoQ to 475 deals. The sales activity in multiple-user factories was mainly led by resale transactions buildings such as West Connect Building and Mega@Woodlands. This was likely backed by local SMEs that acquired ramp-up facilities with modern specifi cations and reasonable remaining tenure for their own business operations. As there were signs showing price resistance for some industrial buildings with shorter tenure, Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for 30-year leasehold industrial properties remained fl at at S$305 per sq ft in Q2/2022. On the other hand, some 60-year leasehold and freehold industrial properties recorded larger price increases, supporting the overall price growth in Q2. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, 60-year leasehold prices increased by 2.4% QoQ to S$457 per sq ft while that of freehold properties rose by 2.8% QoQ to S$749 per sq ft in Q2/2022. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPECS INDUSTRIAL The islandwide vacancy level for business park space rose by 0.5 of a ppt QoQ to 14.9% in Q2/2022, a reversal of the 1.1 ppt QoQ decline in the previous quarter. While vacancy rate in the Central and East Planning Region remained relatively fl at from Q1, the completion of CleanTech Three led to an increase in vacancy rate in the West Planning Region to 29.9%, the highest since Q4/2004. Owing to the scarcity and steady demand in Mapletree Business City and one-north regions, Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents continued trending up in Q2, rising by 0.7% QoQ to S$5.93 per sq ft. Savills' standard business park properties6 monthly rents also increased by 0.7% QoQ to S$4.03 per sq ft as some of the landlords at Science Park started to raise their rental expectations. Some of the more accessible high- specs industrial developments in prime locations also saw an uptick in their rents in Q2/2022. Some fi rms do not mind a slight rental premium for the accessibility and convenience of the location. As such, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-specs industrial basket7 increased by 1.1% QoQ to S$3.61 per sq ft in Q2/2022. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 15 July 2022. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft.

Besides rising imported infl ation which translated to greater domestic cost pressures, there is also the spectre of China's growth slowdown and political tensions in the North Asia. Furthermore, the fi ght against infl ation has woken up the US Federal Reserve Bank to hike interest rates into a slowing economy. The complementary actions by central banks in advanced economies to tame infl ation is synchronising the global economic cycle on the downside. Singapore's economy, however, is still expected to expand this year because of the low base we came out of in 2021. Although the economy is expected to continue growing, the pace of growth will be slower compared with last year as trade-related sectors may moderate amid persistent supply constraints and the expected recession facing developed economies. It is perhaps in 2023 that we may see greater lacklustre economic performance once we have set a high totem mark this year. Despite strengthening headwinds, the industrial and logistics market remained as one of the most resilient sub-asset classes across the spectrum of real estate market. As fl ight- landlords to pass through higher service charges to the occupiers. Also, one cannot rule out the possibility that domestic pump priming works may be on the off ering if the external economy slows, and SMEs may expand their industrial space to handle higher domestic related demand. As rents for prime multiple-user factory space had already risen 9.0% Year-to-Date, we are revising out full-year increase from 0% to 2% to 10% to 12%. Even if the economy were to slow, the prospect of domestic pump priming activities may embolden SMEs to take on greater space. For warehouse & logistics properties, we maintain our forecast of a 2% to 5% rise this year.
