The family is grateful for the outpouring of condolences and love for the late Subhas. The family asks to be able to grieve privately during this very difficult time. Details of the funeral will be shared at a later stage.\"Simon Tan, a lawyer with Attorneys Inc LLC, said: \"This is sad news. He was a champion of what some called 'lost cause' cases. He was widely regarded as a beacon of hope for those who needed legal help but had no financial resources to hire big guns.\"He will be much missed for his larger than life presence and aura in court. The legal fraternity has lost a luminary.''Mr Subhas, who is known for his compassion, had earned a reputation for defending notorious criminals, often on pro bono basis.Among his more high profile cases included convicted murderers Anthony Ler, who hired a teenager to kill his wife in 2001; Took Leng How, a vegetable packer who befriended eight-year-old girl Huang Na, then killed her in 2004; and Leong Siew Chor, who chopped up a woman he killed in the Kallang body parts case.The prominent lawyer was a senior partner at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing and president of the Association of Criminal Lawyers in Singapore. He had suffered long-standing heart and kidney ailments which involved frequent hospital treatment and had to undergo dialysis thrice a week.Another lawyer, Amolat Singh, a long-time friend of Mr Subhas, told The Straits Times: \"Everybody is in utter disbelief. It's a very shocking piece of news, like a bolt out of the blue. He was out and about, always giving people encouragement. There was never a moment that we thought he was going so soon.

Indeed, year-on-year quarterly and annual growth still slowed - to 2.1 per cent in Q4 from 2.8 per cent in Q3, and to 2.9 per cent in 2014 from 2013's revised growth rate of 4.4 per cent (previously 3.9 per cent).The latest GDP growth figures were released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Tuesday. The government maintained its 2015 growth forecast at a \"modest pace\" of 2-4 per cent, noting that \"the global economic outlook has softened in recent months, with growth in 2015 expected to come in only marginally better than in 2014\".Manufacturing recorded the weakest growth among the sectors, and pulled overall Q4 GDP growth down by 0.3 percentage point. Weighed down by the transport engineering and electronics clusters, the manufacturing sector contracted 1.3 per cent y-o-y - a far cry from Q3's 1.7 per cent growth. Still, manufacturing's Q4 performance was better than the official advance estimate of a larger contraction of 2 per cent.Although the services sector grew 3.1 per cent y-o-y in Q4, this was a slight drop from Q3's 3.3 per cent expansion. With a 10.3 per cent expansion in Q4, the finance & insurance sector outperformed all other services producing industries, singlehandedly contributing 1.2 percentage points to Q4 GDP growth. Except for transportation & storage - which contracted 0.4 per cent - all services sectors saw growth in Q4.Non-oil domestic exports (NODX), also released on Tuesday, beat forecasts as well. NODX grew 4.3 per cent y-o-y in January, boosted by electronics and pharmaceutical exports. But Citi economist Kit Wei Zheng cautioned that \"the strong January data should be interpreted with caution given front-loading ahead of Lunar New Year\", while OCBC economist Selena Ling said that although exports were off to a good start in 2015, they were \"likely skewed by seasonal effects\".Economists from CIMB and HSBC also noted that labour productivity growth remains elusive. It declined 1.5 per cent y-o-y in Q4 - the third consecutive quarter of decline, and a worsening from Q3's 0.9 per cent contraction.For the whole of 2014, labour productivity declined 0.8 per cent - compared to 2013's 0.3 per cent growth. With Singapore's low unemployment rate of 2 per cent, the rise in unit labour cost accelerated to 3.5 per cent last year, up from 2.4 per cent in 2013.\"The decline in overall productivity can be attributed not only to productivity falling across most sectors, but also a rise in the employment share of less productive, domestically oriented sectors,\" said MTI.While lower oil prices have generally had a positive effect on the economy - they have lowered utilities and fuel-related costs for businesses - MTI economics division director Yong Yik Wei warned that the marine and offshore sector could face some obstacles if the slump in oil prices is sustained beyond the short term, since orders for oil-related equipment could fall.MTI permanent secretary Ow Foong Pheng again flagged the \"challenging\" global economic environment, noting that externally oriented sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale trade are likely to face headwinds going forward. \"Domestically, the labour market is expected to remain tight, with low unemployment and rising vacancy rates. As a result, labour-intensive sectors such as construction, retail and food services may see their growth weighed down by labour constraints. Nonetheless, other domestically-oriented sectors such as business services are expected to remain resilient.\"As for monetary policy implications, most economists seem to think that the central bank would refrain from easing further in April, since Tuesday's better-than-expected data lowers the odds of another slope reduction at its next review.READ MORE:"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

After less than two years, on 9th August 1965, Singapore was on its own.The power of the national story since then is one of the most compelling and astonishing in world history. For those of us from other countries who now live here, it is a fabulously interesting time to be in Singapore.A large amount of nostalgia and navel gazing is mixing with a feverish public debate about the next chapters of this dramatic national story.Many Singaporeans, mostly in online forums, write that a new style of governance is the best way forward. As a business person, I think what might be more needed by such anonymously bold netizens is less demands for what they believe they are entitled to and more entrepreneurialism (more get up and go).At the same time, I do think it is what the government wants its people to embrace but wonder whether the young Singaporeans especially wish to do so.There are two reasons I think that Singapore will always struggle to develop local entrepreneurship as another driver of the local economy. These are not the only reasons but they give a sense of the juicy contradiction within the Singapore story.The first reason I will illustrate by referring to my friend's daily commute on the local (MRT) trains. At one of her stations, every day, there is an announcement.I encourage you to read this out loud to imagine what she thinks every day when she hears it: \"Attention please! For passengers on Platform A who were unable to board the train, please wait for the next train.\"Every day she wonders who thinks this announcement is needed. And if it is needed, what sense of self-responsibility is the aim when the spotlessly clean and air-conditioned trains arrive every few minutes.For anyone to miss a train and then run out of the station and try and find an alternative way to work before the next one arrived, they would have to sprint up the stairs and turn into Superman.The second reason is more fundamental and harder to overcome. The Singaporean government itself is extremely entrepreneurial. It has been like this for 50 years and for those of us who come to this country to work and to live, we can see how stunningly and constantly entrepreneurial it is even after such obvious success and achievement.Only a few years ago, I recall the Prime Minister announcing a move into the so-called 'industries of the future' with a plan to build a BioPolis for research into pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Within a few years it was built.At the same time, the Sentosa Integrated Resort and the Singapore Wheel and the Gardens by the Bay as was the Marina Bay Sands. The list is endless in government policy initiatives too.Singapore Airlines remains an amazing example. Back in the 70's every other national carrier was there to carry the flag of their country and lose hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Not Singapore Airlines. Lee Kuan Yew gave the go-ahead to the airline on the basis that there would no hand-outs and that it was to make money in its first year and every year after or be closed.And it did (which is more than can be said of its sister airlines Tiger and Scoot...).If we tie these two things together, what do we see?In my reading of Singapore's history and of government responses, there has always been a necessity and an urgency to innovate. Such governmental entrepreneurialism has always been needed for jobs, for growth, for security, and so on. It simply had to and has to keep moving the place forward economically and socially.By comparison, I don't see any stirring reason for Singaporeans to feel the necessity, as if your survival depended on it, to be entrepreneurial.There is entrepreneurship in Singapore. There are many, many Singaporean entrepreneurs. I have met hundreds and most of them (ironically) complain that younger Singaporeans do not share their entrepreneurial spirit.There are many foreign entrepreneurs like me here too. There are role models of all nationalities to demonstrate what can be done. But, is it valued?Is it admired when so much can already be achieved without such risk? Is it admired when working in a safe and secure banking job with all its perks and fancy (meaningless) titles is valued more highly amongst parents and peers?In a recent article on startups and entrepreneurs I was shocked by the lack of Singaporeans that the paper chose to feature. Half the people who were chosen to tell their success stories were PR's.Many of Singapore's famous leaders have questioned the size of Singapore's market as a big enough test-market for new products and services. Therefore, they have to test beyond Singapore and this extra requirement brings extra risk which is an impediment.I have never looked at Singapore as one market; I have always looked at the entire Asia Pac region, from China to Australia, and now in fact the whole world. All by using Singapore as the epicentre of my business.I wonder if you can't be left to find your own way onto the next train each day, what does this say about whether the government really believes in Singaporeans' ability to become entrepreneurs? What can they do to ensure that Singapore's next 50 years are as dramatically successful as its first 50?On a more positive note, I wonder if and when the government's example will be enough to stir local hearts and minds to take their own bold initiatives. Let's hope more Singaporeans overcome the struggle and have confidence in themselves and their ideas and take that risk. What do you think?"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The radiopharmaceuticals market would also be impacted as Parkway would be the only commercial supplier of radiopharmaceuticals here if the merger is allowed.No potential new radiopharmaceutical supplier is expected to enter the market in the next two to three years to compete with the merged entity, noted the CCS.Parkway announced in September that it was acquiring 100 per cent of Singapore-based RadLink for $137 million, but the deal was contingent on it being given the green light by the CCS.While it is possible for them to appeal, the firms may have already moved on.Parkway's parent IHH Healthcare stated last Friday that the deal had lapsed, while RadLink's parent company Fortis Healthcare, which is listed in India, announced that it would explore other opportunities.IHH's Parkway group has 16 radiology facilities here while RadLink has six.Doctors say that the market for radiology and imaging services is likely a growing one.\"We have an ageing population that requires more of these services. Patients are reading more online and coming into clinics and asking about sophisticated tests,\" said Dr Chia Shi-Lu, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health.\"But not everyone needs the most sophisticated scan, it's up to ethical doctors to recommend the most appropriate one,\" he cautioned.Most large public hospitals do their radiology and imaging services in-house.feimok@sph.com.sgkashc@sph.com.sgJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Its like Tiong Bahru 10 years ago, he says. Everyone laughed at us when we first bought en bloc sale sites there because they thought it was an area with an ageing population. But, given its city-fringe location, it has been gentrified and has now become a hip area. UOL had changed the perception of Tiong Bahru as an area for retirees a decade ago with the launch of a series of freehold private condominiums such as the 234-unit Twin Regency in 2004, the 84-unit Regency Suites in 2005 and the 158-unit The Regency at Tiong Bahru a year later. That brought a new generation of young families, singles and couples to the neighbourhood. When most people think of the Bartley area, they tend to associate it with the Mount Vernon crematorium and the Bidadari cemetery. The crematorium closed in 2004, and the corpses at the Bidadari cemetery were exhumed in 2002. The area will be turned into the Bidadari Estate, with 10,000 public flats and 1,000 private homes, under the URA Master Plan. And peoples perception of the area is starting to change, notes Liam. UOL Groups introduction of dual-key flexi units at Botanique at Bartley could make the area an attractive residential zone for people of all ages. The dual-key flexi units are likely to appeal to both investors and multi-generational families. The showflats of Botanique at Bartley feature prototype two- and three-bedroom dual-key flexi units. A departure from the typical dual-key units that share a common main entrance, the three-bedroom flexi unit with du- al-key option is designed with two separate main entrances to an interconnected unit, ex- plains Liam. Typical three-bedroom flexi units at Botanique at Bartley are 1,130 to 1,356 sq ft, while the two-bedroom flexi units are 732 to 956 sq ft. The flexi units will give homeowners some flexibility to customise their interior spaces ac- cording to their lifestyle needs at different stages of their lives, says Liam. The dual-key option will appeal to both owner-occupiers and investors. Multi-generational families can live under one roof without compromising on privacy, while investors can live in their unit and lease out space at the same time, he adds. Dual-key units have taken various forms over the past decade. They first surfaced as units for multi-generational living in November 2006, when the 382-unit The Metropolitan, located next to the Redhill MRT station, was launched by CapitaLand and Lippo Group. Frasers Centrepoint championed the dual-key concept at two of its projects launched in 2009 the 712-unit The Caspian at Lakeside and the 330-unit 8@Woodleigh at Potong Pasir. In 2012, the developer created a brand for its dual-key units called Trio. At North Park Residences, its 920-unit condo located within an integrated development in Yishun, Frasers Centrepoint introduced Trio loft units. Some developers have offered homebuyers some form of customisation at their up- scale condos. For example, Far East Organization introduced its white plan concept under its Inessence brand at its luxury condo developments such as the 28-unit Boulevard Vue in 2007 and the 50-unit Alba at Cairnhill Rise in 2009. The developer introduced white SOHOs at The Seawind in Telok Kurau. They are basically loft units with high ceilings and platforms to provide homeowners with addi- tional storage or usage space. Mainland Chinese developer Qingjian Realty pioneered CoSpace for its Ecopolitan executive condo (EC) project in 2013. The CoSpace was reintroduced at the launch of its two other EC projects late last year the 561-unit Belle- woods in Woodlands and 651-unit Bellewaters on Anchorvale Crescent in Sengkang giving homebuyers flexibility in turning the addition- al space into an expanded walk-in wardrobe or en suite study. Early last month, Qingjian also introduced its CoSpace Flexi, which offers homebuyers bare units that they can customise to suit their needs. The move also translates into savings of $30,000 to $45,000 for each unit. The showflat of a 732 sq ft, two-bedroom dual-key flexi unit One of the bedrooms in the two-bedroom flexi unit has been converted into a workspace The master bedroom of the two-bedroom flexi unit. Every bedroom in the project except for the helpers room can fit a queen-sized bed. Good to have Dual-key and flexi units may come in different shapes and sizes, but what is clear is that an increasing number of developers are providing homebuyers with more options for space customisation. In the current market scenario, its a good option to have, says Alvin Tan, senior director of Savills Singapore. Savills, Huttons and Knight Frank are the joint marketing agents of UOLs Botanique at Bartley. With sentiment cautious as a result of worries about falling prices and rents, fears of oversupply, and buying restrictions from the introduction of the additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) and total debt servicing ratio, homebuyers have become very discerning and price-sensitive. With all the measures in place, they feel like they have only one shot at buying a home today, and they want to make sure that they buy the right one, notes Savills Tan. When homebuyers look at a new launch, they will consider the demand-supply dynamics in the particular location, whether there is a growth story that can enhance the future value of their property and accessibility in terms of public transport, amenities and schools, says Liam. Once all these boxes are checked, they will then zoom in on the layout and efficiency of the units, the design specifications and the reputation of the developer. Even though Botanique at Bartley is a mid- tier project, UOL is offering purchasers luxury specifications and finishing: full marble flooring for the living and dining room, American oak timber flooring for the bedrooms and SMEG kitchen appliances. The specifications for the development are on a par with those of UOLs Thomson Three in District 20, an established residential estate on Upper Thom- son Road, and Seventy St Patricks in prime district 15 in the east. As at end-February, only eight units remained unsold at the 445-unit Thomson Three, a joint-venture project between UOL and its sister company, Singapore Land. The latest median price achieved was $1,383 psf. At Seventy St Patricks, which is also by UOL, close to 80% of the 186-unit freehold project has been sold, with only 38 units remaining as at end-February. The latest median price achieved was $1,699 psf, according to URA. The kitchen of a three-bedroom premium unit is equipped with SMEG kitchen appliances, including a coffee-making machine and wine chiller The master bathroom of a showflat is fitted with Italian accessories Pricing and location UOL intends to price the 797-unit Botanique at Bartley at an average price of $1,300 psf. Based on the indicative price, about 70% of the units will cost less than $1 million. That does not mean that all the units are shoebox apartments, Liam says. Typical one-bedroom units start from 495 sq ft, while two-bed- room units are from 657 sq ft and three-bed- room units, from 1,033 sq ft. The three-bed- room premium units can go up to 1,270 sq ft. All the bedrooms in each unit of the project can fit a queen-sized bed with the exception of the helpers bedroom, which fits a single bed, according to Liam. At least 70% of the units will have a view of either the landscaped gardens or water features, and there will even be one-bedroom units with a wide frontage to maximise views. The preview of Botanique at Bartley starts on the weekend of March 21 and 22, with the official launch scheduled for a fortnight later. It will be the third residential project to be launched in the Bartley area. According to property agents, Botanique at Bartley has been seeing healthy interest among potential homebuyers. It is located within a three-minute walk of the Bartley MRT station and in the vicinity of top school Maris Stella High School. The first private condo project to be launched in the Bartley area was the 702-unit Bartley Residences in 2012. The 99-year leasehold project by listed property group City Developments Ltd (CDL) and its privately held parent company Hong Leong Group was fully sold with- in a year of its launch, at an average price of $1,200 psf. The second project was the 868-unit Bart- ley Ridge, a 99-year leasehold project jointly developed by CDL, Hong Leong and TID Pte Ltd (a joint venture between Hong Leong and Mitsui Fudosan). Launched in March 2013, only 25 units remained unsold as at end-February. Transactions from December to February ranged from $1,084 to $1,215 psf, according to caveats lodged with URA Realis. The Bartley area has gained acceptance, given the success of the two earlier projects that were launched, one of which [Bartley Residences] is fully sold and the other [Bartley Ridge] is 97% sold, says Liam. And in terms of future supply, there is only one other small site located opposite ours. So, there isnt much supply downstream, and whatever has been launched upstream is already substantially sold. UOL had purchased the Botanique at Bart- ley site in January 2014 for $648 psf per plot ratio (ppr). Analysts estimate the break-even price for the project to be around $1,100 psf. UOLs purchase price psf for the site was 4.3% higher than the $621 psf ppr paid by CDL and Hong Leong for the Bartley Residences site in 2011. CDL, Hong Leong and TID paid a more cautious $498 psf ppr for the Bartley Ridge site in January 2012, a month after the ABSD was rolled out. Whats next? Another 99-year leasehold residential project in the pipeline for launch this year is UOLs 663- unit condo on Prince Charles Crescent. UOL and the privately held Kheng Leong Group paid $463.1 million, or $821 psf ppr, for the site, which was purchased in April last year. It is about 14.5% lower in terms of price psf ppr compared with the $960 psf ppr paid for an adjacent 99-year leasehold site in September 2012 by the consortium comprising Wing Tai Holdings, Metro Holdings and UE E&C. That site has since been launched as The Crest. The 469-unit project opened for sale last October, and 66 units were sold as at end-February, with the latest median price at $1,640 psf. Our project on Prince Charles Crescent will be launched later this year, and its an exciting site, says Liam. About 80% of the 294,712.5 sq ft, 99-year leasehold parcel will be open space. It fronts the Alexandra Canal and the Alexandra park connector on one side, and on the other sides, it overlooks the Good Class Bungalow area of Jervois Road, Mount Echo Park and Bishopsgate. Last year, UOL made its maiden foray into London, buying the Heron Plaza site from UK developer Gerald Ronson of Heron International. UOL paid 97 million ($199.8 million) for the site located on Bishopsgate in the City of London. The Heron Plaza site has already obtained planning approval for the development of a 43-storey tower with 562,000 sq ft of gross floor area. It can be developed into a 190-room hotel with 109 residential units sit- ting on the higher floors. There are conservation shophouses on the site that will be turned into retail space. However, UOL is seeking approval to intensify the use of the space and to add more hotel rooms and residential units. The hotel block will be Pan Pacifics flagship hotel in the UK and Europe. The new residential development in Lon- don will be launched in 2016. It could be show- cased in Singapore, says Liam. We saw a clear value proposition for the site, as it is located just 200m from the Liverpool Street station and the future Crossrail station and will be a game changer when it is completed in 2018. The residential market in Singapore is expected to remain challenging this year with the property cooling measures still in place, says Liam.

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "IT IS by now largely forgotten that the first electorate Mr Lee Kuan Yew ever had to face and the first votes he ever canvassed were not, as one may expect, in Singapore but in Britain.Soon after graduation from Cambridge, Mr Lee and his wife volunteered to help a university friend who was then standing as parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party in Totnes, a charming, rural part of western England. The fight was hopeless: The constituency had been a bastion for the Conservatives for at least one century, and remains so to this day.Still, the young Mr Lee plunged into the electoral campaign with gusto and, although \"voters were intrigued to see a Chinese speaking\" - as Mr Lee subsequently recorded in his memoirs - they listened to him intently. Mr Lee and his parliamentary candidate friend were duly defeated, but the British sense of fair play and Britain's openness to foreigners were qualities that Mr Lee always praised about the British.That first parliamentary battle also showcased his other side: a willingness - some would say even an irresistible desire - to criticise the British whenever he thought they were erring.Back in 1950, he reminded Totnes voters that the British were receiving at that time more money from Malaysia's rubber plantations and tin mines than war-torn Britain was getting in subsidies from the United States. Britain, he argued, had to pay attention to Malaysia and take the administration of its colonies seriously. It also had to prepare for life after the empire.Mr Lee always regarded such criticism as just a friendly advice to a close friend, and he shrugged off warnings that many British politicians did not relish the experience.Yet few of his British critics - of which there were many - were ever aware of how deeply personal and how enduring his links with Britain really were.It was British education that fashioned his adult life, a conscious choice he made despite the availability of many other options, and one repeated by both his sons.It was in Britain that he tied the knot with his life-long partner; their decision to marry at the registry office in Stratford-upon- Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace, was a tacit acknowledgment of their love for British literature.Throughout their adult lives, they came back to Britain to relax, and to be photographed in the same spot, on the same bridge in Cambridge, recalling that black- and-white picture taken in the first, carefree year of their married life.As fate would have it, it was also during such a trip that Madam Kwa Geok Choo suffered her first stroke: They were united on British soil, and they were also given the first warning that their lives were going to be parted on the same British soil.Notwithstanding all these extraordinary links, Mr Lee was never a \"colonial nostalgic\", if only because, as veteran commentator Philip Bowring noted, \"he saw enough of British failures not to want to ape them\".He admired Britain's National Health Service, the prototype of a state-funded welfare system copied by most other industrial nations, and recounted his surprise when, during his Cambridge days, he was given both a pair of spectacles and dental treatments for free.But he also swiftly concluded that the system is unaffordable, and that it discourages economic enterprise. Britain's political experiments inspired him, yet also served as a warning: Like the red government documents box that he, like all British ministers carried around, and which continues to be produced by the London-based company Barrow & Gale, Mr Lee kept the outward structures of Britain's political model, but its contents were entirely Singaporean.Yet one of the most important lessons which he drew from the British - and one which, sadly, is seldom recalled today - is that independence neither required a complete break with the old colonial power, nor was an automatic ticket to prosperity.\"The choice lies between a communist republic of Malaya and a Malaya within the British Commonwealth led by people who, despite their opposition to imperialism, still share certain ideals in common with the Commonwealth,\" he told a group of fellow students members of the Malayan Forum in London in 1950.The overwhelming majority of the British politicians who coincided with Mr Lee's tenure in power are now gone: Out of the 10 prime ministers who governed Britain since Mr Lee was first swept into office in 1959, only four are alive today, and all experienced power after he stepped down as prime minister.Many British politicians who knew him found him annoying; they were not used to a foreigner reminding them just how badly Britain was doing. But not one doubted his formidable intellect and knowledge: \"His quick brain\", reported London's Evening Standard daily in the late 1960s, \"make him a good match\" for the then British Prime Minister Harold Wilson.\"Luckily,\" the newspaper added, \"the two are friends.\"Yet one relationship stands out as unique: that between Lady Margaret Thatcher and Mr Lee.\"Prime Minister, an hour's talk with you is itself worth a journey halfway round the world and further still,\" she said at a banquet held in her honour at the Istana in April 1985. \"There is no other world leader I have met in my time in office whom I have admired more for the strength of his convictions, the clarity of his views, the directness of his speech and for his vision of the way ahead.\"Both leaders fervently believed in the creativity of market economies, and both knew that good governance cannot be accomplished by doing only what is popular.Lady Thatcher once remarked in Mr Lee's presence, that those like her born in the Year of the Ox \"are capable of anger and show an implacable side to our natures\".\"Well well,\" she added, \"there are some things one should be implacable about.\"After she resigned as prime minister, Mr Lee was one of the first foreign leaders to pay her tribute: \"I admired and respected her combativeness. There's a certain willingness to rough it out with the toughest around the place and to take on all corners,\" he said.And, again, fate added a strange twist. For different reasons and circumstances, both stepped down from office on exactly the same day - Nov 28, 1990. He was the world's longest-serving prime minister; she was Britain's longest-serving prime minister of the 20th century. They remained close friends for life.Britain honoured Mr Lee in every official way. Queen Elizabeth II undertook no less than three state visits to Singapore: in 1972, 1989 and 2006, a rare honour bestowed on only a few other countries.But it is also true that, as the decades since independence went by, fewer and fewer of Britain's politicians knew of their links with Singapore, or of the enormous contributions Mr Lee personally made to nurturing them.At one point, there was pressure in the British Parliament to sell Eden Hall, the grand residence of the British High Commissioners in Singapore; Sir Antony Acland, the then head of the British diplomatic service, had to appear in person before lawmakers to persuade them that the British representative in Singapore needed something more than just a unit in a communal housing with the occasional access to the void deck.And, when Britain's Home Office introduced a new requirement demanding from all those applying for a long-term residence in Britain to pass an English language test, its officials needed some persuasion before agreeing that Singaporeans should not be required to prove that they can speak English.Finally, while the Five Powers Defence Arrangements, a network of treaties, formally bind Singapore and Britain in a military alliance, the moment these treaties were mentioned in London, British officials usually preferred to change the subject and talk about the weather. Familiarity did ultimately breed contempt.British knowledge of Singapore remains poor. As British newspapers marked Mr Lee's departure, they recycled all the usual cliches about Singapore, such as the \"banning\" of chewing gum or the allegedly draconian fines.But in all the obituaries published on Mr Lee, only one mentioned Britain's decision to break a promise and pull back its forces from Singapore, exposing the island-state to economic and security problems.For the Brits, this \"East of Suez\" withdrawal is history best forgotten; to Mr Lee, this rankled for long.Still, as Singapore's founding father embarked on his last journey this week, all the ceremonials, from the gun carriage, the music, the troops, the lone bagpiper playing Auld Lang Syne and the lying in state, were British-inspired.Mr Lee would have approved, for he believed that the best example of a secure nation is one which does not run away from its history.Nor can one forget an episode back in the late 1960s, when during a garden party Mr Lee started criticising the rotten state of modern Britain before Mr George Brown, the visiting British Foreign Secretary.Mr Brown listened with an amused grin and, when Mr Lee finished, he turned to him and replied: \"Harry, you're the finest Englishman east of Suez.\"For one of the rare moments in his life, Mr Lee was stumped for words.Jonathan.eyal@gmail.comJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Call them the \"coolness\" litmus test of a neighbourhood. Once they start popping up, it is time to pay attention.In Yishun, the sleepy estate in the north of Singapore, several new cafes have opened in recent months.Two of these outfits are Holy Cow Creamery, an ice cream parlour in Yishun Street 22, and RoyceMary Cafe, serving coffee and desserts out of a unit in a mixed-use building in Victory 8 in Jalan Legundi.And then there are the bike shops, with at least four of them along Yishun Avenues 6 and 7 alone, supplying the hipster transportation staple.Is Yishun becoming the next Tiong Bahru?Hardly.But the area, which has more than 250,000 residents, is no lifeless backwater.In fact, it is mounting a modest renaissance, with new amenities, gleaming healthcare facilities, a mega mall in the works and new flats and properties in the making.The biggest development is Northpoint City, a commercial and residential development which will be integrated with the existing Northpoint Shopping Centre.When it opens in 2018, it will be the largest mall in northern Singapore with more than 500 shopping and dining outlets. It will also house the first community club within a mall and an integrated transport hub linking the mall to an air-conditioned bus interchange and Yishun MRT station.Junction Nine in Yishun Avenue 9, a 99-year leasehold mixed development that has retail units and private homes called Nine Residences, will also open in 2017. The 186-unit residential project will have a mix of one-bedroom to two-storey apartments.And Yishun estate is still not that expensive.Property agents say the prices in the area have remained steady and mirror general market trends.Mr Donald Han, managing director of property consulting group Chestertons, says prices in Yishun were going up from about 2009, but after 2013, they started going down because the introduction of tougher mortgage rules - the total debt servicing ratio - made it harder for people to obtain loans.But he adds that there has been stronger demand for mixed developments in Yishun, such as the upcoming Nine Residences.Units there were sold at a median price of $1,196 per square foot (psf) in December, significantly higher than the median prices for other Yishun developments such as Lilydale ($742 psf), The Estuary ($916 psf) and The Canopy ($696 psf).He attributes the draw of Nine Residences to its location and proximity to transportation options.Other property experts say the greenery in the area - Yishun Pond, Seletar Reservoir and the Orchid Country Club with its golf courses - are also plus points for buyers.Indeed, Yishun, like several off-city centre, well- developed suburban neighbourhoods in Singapore, has become a conducive place to call home, especially in terms of recreational options in nature. It has serene green spaces, scenic waterways, enhanced parks, cycling paths and exercise corners.Named after pineapple and rubber tycoon Lim Nee Soon, whose name is Lin Yishun in Mandarin, the estate was one of the first three towns selected in 2007 under the Housing & Development Board's (HDB) Remaking Our Heartland initiative and still enjoys the fruit of that upgrading exercise.The Lower Seletar Reservoir along Yishun Avenue 1 was revamped at a cost of $10 million and now features a multi-purpose stage with a water play area, a Rowers' Bay for competitive rowing and a 170m-long jetty-like bridge that extends from the banks of the reservoir across the waters.In a 2011 makeover, Yishun Pond unveiled floating wetlands, flower trails and a three-storey lookout tower. The waters there teem with orange cichlid fish and tortoises, and wading birds can be seen in the marshlands.A 15.5km cycling trail is also due for completion this year and will connect major transport nodes, neighbourhood centres and parks.Since last month, residents have also been enjoying Orto, a new leisure park the size of seven football fields that opened on the site of the former Bottle Tree Park. Visitors can go fishing or prawning round the clock in the park, which also has several eateries.Ms Yen Sim, senior manager of corporate communications and branding at the China-based Fullshare Leisure Group, which manages the place, says Fullshare decided to bid for the site because there were opportunities for a variety of recreational activities and eateries to be added to the park.\"Furthermore, it has a distinctive kampung feel that retains the old charm of Singapore in the 1960s and 1970s,\" she says.By the park's grand opening in June, its activity offerings will include paintball, futsal and trampoline.\"Yishun is no longer a boring or ulu town,\" says odd-job worker Angela Teo, 49, using the Malay word for \"remote\". She has lived in the area for more than 20 years.A variety of properties is also rising to meet the demand. More than 17,000 new residential units - both public and private developments - will be added to Yishun by the next few years.As of June 2013, the HDB has launched 10 Build-To-Order (BTO) projects and one Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) project, providing a total of 9,500 units. These include Yishun Greenwalk, DBSS Adora Green and Vista Spring.Seven private housing sites yielding close to 3,300 units were also awarded to private developers for executive condominiums/condominiums and landed housing developments.Apart from these projects, there is also the 920-unit North Park Residences, a condominium with one- to five-bedroom apartments ranging from 431 sq ft to 1,432 sq ft. It is part of the Northpoint City development.Mr Mohamed Ismail, chief executive of PropNex Realty, one of the firms selling the North Park Residences, foresees that younger buyers from the ages of 25 will be interested in the Residences, which is located in Yishun Central.He says: \"Younger buyers these days tend to say, 'Give me a lifestyle and I will pay.' They are willing to trade house size for a conveniently located development.\"The new residents seem to agree.Ms Vania Lim, 30, moved into a three-room flat in Adora Green last year with her husband.She likes the green necklace that surrounds her estate - Yishun Pond is a stone's throw away, which makes for a scenic exercise route, and she also likes it that there are several young couples among her neighbours, whom she can relate to.\"There are also plenty of food options in the neighbourhood and three supermarkets within walking distance,\" she says.While some residents interviewed say Yishun's new vibrancy has also resulted in more human traffic, which translates to more crowded bus interchanges, trains and buses, they acknowledge that the precinct has become a more exciting place to live in, with upcoming developments to look forward to.Long-time Yishun dweller Foo Wang Cheow, 60, remembers a time when Yishun used to be a cluster of kampungs.In the early days, Mr Lim Nee Soon, who lived from 1879 to 1936, had owned large pineapple and rubber plantations in the area.Chinese immigrants whom he hired as labourers in his plantations soon settled down in the area and formed villages and kampungs.Mrs Foo recalls living in one of these kampungs and helping her father sell his homemade cheng tng - the Chinese soup dessert with ingredients such as longans, barley and lotus seeds.The housewife says: \"It was a noisy, bustling and exciting place. People reared pigs and poultry and many also grew vegetables and fruit to sell.\"In 1984, when the town started to be developed - it was one of the earliest towns developed by the HDB - the newly married Mrs Foo moved into a four-room flat in Block 750 Yishun Street 72 with her husband.\"There were no buses near our home then, much less a bus interchange. There was also no MRT station yet,\" she recalls, adding that bus services began many months later and Yishun MRT station commenced in 1988.Yishun continued its slow transformation until 1992, when two game-changing developments took place.Frasers Centrepoint opened Northpoint Shopping Centre, Singapore's first heartland mall. That same year, cinema operator Golden Village launched its first cineplex, GV Yishun, with 10 cinema halls and 2,400 seats.Now, Yishun's rejuvenation is also attracting visitors from other neighbourhoods.Ms Shirley Marlando, 31, one of the founders of Holy Cow Creamery, says that while her clientele consists of Yishun residents, the shop also sees people from Sembawang, Woodlands and as far as Jurong.Maybe that is why Mrs Foo has no plans to leave.She has lived in the same flat for the past 30 years with her husband, now 61, and 33-year-old son. Her married daughter also lives in the estate so as to remain close to her.\"Yishun has really become a convenient place to live in over the years and this will be where I retire,\" says Mrs Foo.brynasim@sph.com.sgWhat do you like or not like about Yishun?

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Three years ago, Masood Rashid, founding partner of London-based boutique financial brokerage firm Opes Financial Partners, thought it was a great opportunity when he was invited by a top UK law firm to provide financing for potential buyers at a weekend property exhibition in Hong Kong and Singapore. The project showcased was located in the exclusive neighbourhood of St Johns Wood, with prices starting from over 2 million. There was a lot of activity, and people were busy buying and signing contracts to purchase, recounts Rashid, 40. His business partner and director, Matthew Davies, who had attended the weekend exhibitions told him, Wow, its like a new gold rush. However, it was soon clear that many of the buyers had no intention of securing a mortgage as they had started to flip their properties. I saw it as a massive headache, says Rashid. That was the first and last time Opes took part in such an exhibition. Instead, he decided to focus on offering bespoke financing solutions to managers in Geneva, Switzerland and other major wealth hubs, including Singapore and Dubai. They found that many of the wealth man- agers do not provide lending services to clients and Rashid saw an opportunity to plug that gap. The firm saw a lot of Russian clients and has since expanded its business to Asia and the Middle East. Given Rashids financing repertoire, he was able to provide an attractive financing deal for a Malaysian high-net-worth investor recently. The businessman had purchased a 3 mil- lion property in London. A Malaysian bank was only willing to finance up to 65% of the purchase price, or about 2 million. As the maximum loan repayment period was 65 years, and the client was already 60, the loan term was very short and his monthly mortgage, based on capital and interest repayment, would have been around 40,000. It was very high because they were looking at his age, says Rashid. When the investor was introduced to him, Rashid contacted a Swiss bank he had been dealing with. Within days, the bank agreed to finance the businessman. Based on an interest-only mortgage repayment, his monthly debt payment the ultra-rich for their purchases from luxury London pads to private jets and yachts. Beyond the UK, Opes also provides financing for luxury home purchases in other key jurisdictions in Europe, for example Southern France, Marbella and Barcelona, as well as Dubai. Among the worlds top 5% His clients rank among the worlds top 5%, he says, and include the super rich from around the world, particularly the Middle East, India, Pakistan, Russia, Ukraine, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and China. My specialisation is in someone whos big, who could possibly be a PEP [politically exposed person], he adds. [The term] refers to any- one who is politically connected. As long as youre related to a politician it could be a former or a current minister youre a PEP. With London being a global financial hub, almost every bank in the world has a presence there. Regulated banks include overseas banks that are licensed to operate in the UK, but have to comply with the regulations of the UK regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority. Non-regulated banks are those that do not have a presence in the UK, but could still provide lending for UK property purchases. As they are not governed by the FCA, they are considered non-regulated. London property is considered a safe bet, and prices have a close correlation with gold prices But that doesnt mean they are dodgy, says Rashid. They have to comply with the regulations in their own jurisdictions. Opes works with both FCA-regulated and non-regulated banks to give clients greater access to financing solutions. Were at the top of the game, we know whos in and whos out of the market, he adds. Opes does its own due diligence on clients, and so do the banks it works with. Generally, if a client is on FCAs high risk list, the banks will have to do enhanced due diligence, basically a more stringent process. Recently, some of the major UK banks were reprimanded by the various regulatory authorities for being lax in their due diligence. The FCA used to post the list of 95 high- risk countries on its website. It includes almost every country outside the UK, North America and Australia, with the exception of Hong Kong and Singapore, says Rashid. The list was removed from the website late last year after Cayman Islands objected to being included for money laundering activities. Many of Rashids clients are referrals from major banks. He cites the example of a businessman from a former CIS state referred to him by a bank. The businessman wanted to purchase a home in London, and was looking for financing. Rashid secured a 10 million ($20.38 million) loan at a very low interest rate. As he had a US$50 million ($68.5 million) deposit with an offshore bank that was paying him an interest rate of 15%, he was able to use the interest earned to pay his mortgage, and still earn 1.5 million a year in interest. Its called arbitrage, says Rashid. People are hungry to borrow money. We can provide solutions [for them]. Naturally, Rashid has provided financing for some of the biggest residential deals in the UK, from a 50 million mansion to a 120 million property, as well as luxury apartments at One Hyde Park where prices are north of 6,000 psf. In our line of work, discretion is paramount, he says. Were dealing with private high-net-worth clients who want to stay private. London property prices comparable to gold prices Typically, when theres an issue or a crisis in a country, there will be an influx of capital into London real estate, observes Rashid. For example, the problems in Ukraine last year saw an exodus of money. The Arab Spring conflict in 2012 saw money flooding in from Egypt and the Middle East. When France introduced the 75% tax on the rich, many moved to London, and purchased homes. People perceive London property as a safe bet, he says. Theres actually a close correlation between prices of London property and gold. Rashids entire business revolves around the premise of this continuous flood of foreign wealth into London. Our business has gone through the roof. As long as London continues to be a global city, we will continue to do good business. Rashid: My specialisation is in someone whos big, who could possibly be a PEP [politically exposed person] Having spent about a decade working for big mortgage brokerage firms in the UK such as Mortgage Matters Direct and John Charcol, as well as real estate equity firm Cobalt Capital Partners, Rashid started Opes together with Davies in 2011. Initially, the duo visited wealth was 2,500, less than 10% of what he would have paid had he signed on with the Malaysian bank. The Swiss bank assessed him based on his overall wealth, and not just his age and income, says Rashid. He was a wealthy, self-made man with a lot of property. The quick flip Among Asians, buyers of big-ticket homes in London tend to be Chinese, Indonesians and Malaysians, says Rashid. However, Hong Kong and Singapore investors tend to have a trading mentality. A bubble has been created over the last four years, with people buying and selling upon completion, says Rashid. Many of the units are completing in the next two years. And if lending dries up, and the owner can- not secure a buyer or complete the purchase, he will be forced to sell at distressed prices. So, this is going to be a problem. Those buying a flipped contract (or UK properties in a sub-sale) tend to find difficulty in securing financing. There may have been one or two banks in the UK that had initially allowed it, but now they are saying no to reassigned contracts, he adds. So, a lot of these buyers whose game plan is short-term buying and flip- ping the contract before, or at, completion are going to struggle as there wont be much of a market. Rashid was recently referred to a Singaporean investor who had bought a UK property on a reassigned con- tract. He helped him secure a bridge loan until completion. Upon completion of the property, the owner will exit the bridge loan and secure a long-term mortgage at a lower interest rate. Its a complicated structure, admits Rashid. But it has to be structured in a way that doesnt kill the deal for the buyer. This article appeared in the City & Country of Issue 670 (Mar 30) of The Edge Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

After Keppel Corps privatisation of Keppel Land, RHB predicts that these six firms are the next most likely delisting targets.\"Privatisation often means a windfall for investors as the offeror is likely to offer adecent premium over the last traded price to entice minorities to accept the offer,\" noted RHB.1. United Industrial Corporation (UIC)UOL has been tightening its grip on this property development and investment firm in recent years. UOL now holds 44% of UIC, and RHB believes that the firm is likely to get delisted at some point in the near future.We think UOL is likely to eventually raise its stake in UIC above 50% through further open market purchases and/or buying over Haw Pars 5% stake, stated RHB.Privatisation will allow UOL to consolidate UICs SGD7bn of property assets, many of them investment grade commercial properties and hotels, into its books. This will swell UOLs asset base to over SGD10bn.2. Great Eastern HoldingsAfter two previous attempts at privatising GEH, OCBC is likely to take another shot at delisting its life insurance arm. OCBC tried and failed to take GEH private in 2004 and 2006. However, OCBCs acquisition of Wing Hang probably delayed the timetable for any potential privatisation move on GEH.GE has since grown its life insurance franchise in Singapore and Malaysia steadily, maintaining its market leadership in these two countries. Despite a re-rating in the stock price, valuation for the stock remains undemanding at 1.1x P/EV. We have a TP of SGD28.65 based on a P/EV of 1.3x, suggesting an upside of 15%, stated RHB.3. Wheelock Properties (Singapore)This luxury property developer has been caught wrong-footed by a number of its projects. For instance, the group bought a mass-market residential site in Ang Mo Kio in January 2013, on the eve of a new round of property cooling measures that were announced the next day. It also recently took a write-down for a site it bought in Fuyang, China 3 years ago and another write-down for its Scotts Square retail mall, which is experiencing a drop in occupancy due to a sub-optimal tenant mix.Wheelock Singapore is 76% owned by its parent Wheelock & Company (0020 HK), which has a growing property business in China. We think it may privatise Wheelock Singapore and redeploy the excess cash to fund the rapidly growing China business. Based on a 20% discount to its NAV, we think the stock could trade up to a fair value of SGD2.10, stated RHB.4. Wing Tai RHB believes that Wing Tai is mulling privatisation because it will avoid Qualifying Certificate penalties on its luxury unsold projects such as Le Nouvel Ardmore and Nouvel 18 if it gets delisted.Major shareholder, the Cheung family, made a successful partial offer in 2012, at SGD1.39 per share, to bring its stake above 50%. With the stock trading at a deep discount of 55% to its latest book value of SGD3.90, the company has been doing active share buybacks and the Cheung family may yet pounce again in a second privatisation attempt, noted RHB.5. Ho BeeHo Bee is a privatisation candidate because major shareholder Chua Thian Poh owns more than 70% of the stock, and could take the company private if the stock continues to trade at depressed levels.The attraction of the stock is its steady, recurring income stream from its portfolio of investment properties in Singapore and London, coupled with managements proven track record in execution. While its Sentosa projects are currently slow-moving, exposure is limited and the group has earlier made some provisions to writedown its landbank, RHB noted.6. Hong FokWhile asset enhancement initiatives have driven up Hong Foks net asset value in the past years, its stock price is still trading at a 60% discount.We recognise investors concerns with managements past corporate governance practices, but in recent years, it has generally improved. It has dished out a maiden cash dividend, and has committed to continue paying dividends and engaging investors more proactively. We like the value-creation from the asset enhancement initiatives implemented by management, and value the stock at SGD1.05 based on a 50% discount to NAV, stated RHB."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It is connected to the Payar Lebar MRT, and will be able to house offices, shops, and apartments.Lend Lease is no stranger to the real estate market in Singapore, having first established a presence here back in 1973. Chief executive Steve McCann said the Paya Lebar deal is in line with the group's aim to increase international revenue, with Singapore flagged as a key growth market.Here is a look at some of the notable Singapore projects undertaken by Lend Lease:JemThe sprawling development in Jurong Gateway Road spearheads plans to turn Jurong East into Singapore's largest suburban commercial centre.Completed in 2013, it is home to the third largest suburban shopping mall in Singapore, which is managed by Lend Lease.Some of the mall's anchor tenants include Cathay Cineplex, FairPrice Xtra, Robinsons, H&M, and Courts.Jem also has an office component which is being occupied by the Singapore Ministry of National Development, the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority, and the Building and Construction Authority under a single long-term lease.313@Somerset313@Somerset was the first project Lend Lease delivered through its integrated property business model, where it provides services from investment management, development, project management and construction, to asset and property management.The retail mall in Orchard Road was completed in 2009, and has about 177 retailers in the likes of Zara, Uniqlo, Forever 21, and New Look.It was also the first development along Singapore's premium shopping belt to be awarded the Singapore Building and Construction Industry's Green Mark Platinum Award in 2008.Parkway ParadeThe suburban retail mall in Marine Parade is one of Singapore's oldest shopping centres.Lend Lease, which owns some strata retail space at Parkway Parade through one of its managed funds, was in charge of the redevelopment of the mall in two phases from 2002.Parkway Parade has more than 250 stores, including Best Denki, Giant Hypermarket, and Isetan.PoMo CentreLend Lease acquired the mixed-use property in Selegie Road - formerly known as Paradiz Centre - in a joint venture in 2006.It refurbished and rebranded the development, which later received its temporary occupancy permit in 2007.Lend Lease sold PoMo Centre in 2011 as a result of strong market interest.InseadLend Lease was appointed to oversee the campus extension, from design to construction, for global business school Insead in 2003.The project, which comprises a new building with library and gym facilities, auditoriums and offices of a total area of 65,570 sq ft, also included the addition and alteration works to the existing flat room and amphitheatre.It was completed in May 2005.InfineonLend Lease, in partnership with local developer Ascendas Land, won the build and lease for Infineon's Asia-Pacific headquarters after a four-month bidding process in the early 2000s.Infineon is a German semiconductor manufacturer that ranks among the top semiconductor companies globally.The 300,000 sq ft development, located at the junction between Jalan Kolam Ayer and Kallang Way, houses Infineon's corporate, marketing, logistics, as well as research and development functions all under one roof.PfizerIn a joint venture back in 2000, Lend Lease undertook the project to build a US$350 million chemical plant for United States-based drugmaker Pfizer.The facility sits on a 8.8ha site in Tuas Biomedical Park.The project had involved the construction of infrastructure such as a five-storey manufacturing building, a warehouse with dispensary, wastewater treatment plant, and a tank farm.Singapore Airlines Hangars 4 and 5The construction of the Singapore Airlines' hangars, mainly for maintenance, repair and overhaul activities, was awarded to Lend Lease in October 2002.The two hangars span 90m from column to column, and are able to accommodate the commercially successful Boeing 777-400 aircraft.The project was completed in March 2005."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Six developers were bought out since 2010 at an average share-price premium of 26 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the most recent, and largest, transaction, Keppel Corp paid S$2.7 billion (US$2 billion) for the rest of Keppel Land Ltd. in March.Listed developers with just one share in non-Singaporean hands are treated as foreigners under the city-state's regulations, leaving them open to penalties if they miss deadlines to finish projects and sell apartments. Government curbs drove home sales to a six-year low in 2014, leaving more real-estate companies holding unsold units.\"For some of the developers which don't need funding, privatization might make sense,\" Daphne Roth, head of Asian equity research at ABN Amro Private Banking, which manages about US$203 billion, said by phone. \"There's a possibility of more privatisations, especially for the smaller companies where profit will be very much distorted by the charges that they take for unsold properties.\"The controlling shareholder of Wing Tai Holdings may opt to take the company private to avoid such penalties, according to Maybank Kim Eng Holdings Ltd. The developer of luxury homes would face as much as S$211 million in penalties over three years if its units in the Le Nouvel Ardmore and Nouvel 18 projects remain unsold, according to a March report from the brokerage.Other prime candidates for delisting include Ho Bee Land, Wheelock Properties Singapore and Guocoland, because their shares are cheap, according to Vikrant Pandey, an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Holdings. The companies trade at between 0.6 times and 0.8 times their book value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Under the Residential Property Act, foreign developers need to complete construction within five years of purchasing land and offload all units in another two years after that. If they fail to sell them they have to apply for extensions and pay charges from 8 per cent to 24 per cent a year on the value of unsold units.The law is designed to ensure land in Singapore, an island state with a population of more than 5 million, isn't hoarded for speculation. Listed developers are counted as foreign if investors outside Singapore buy shares in them.Businessman Simon Cheong privatised SC Global in January 2013 in a deal that valued the luxury homebuilder at S$745 million. The Marq, a premium residential project near the Orchard Road shopping belt, had 52 per cent of units unsold at the time of the offer, according to data from Maybank Kim Eng. The company's other projects had from 26 per cent to 100 per cent of their units unsold at the time, according to the brokerage.\"Depressed valuations might be an opportunity for the major shareholders to privatise and enjoy the future upside,\" Soo Hai Lim, a Hong Kong-based money manager at Baring Asset, which oversees about US$40 billion globally, said by phone. \"Regulations could be another reason to take companies private. That was the rationale in the case of SC Global.\"Keppel Corp, the world's largest oil-rig builder, paid S$4.38 a share for the 45.4 per cent of Keppel Land it didn't already own. The stock soared 25 per cent on Jan 26 after the offer was announced. The move allows the supplier of rigs to customers including Petroleo Brasileiro SA to diversify its revenue and streamline its organisational structure.Lee Hwee Hong, head of Group Corporate Communications at Wing Tai, and Wheelock spokeswoman Sylvia Sim declined to comment. Ho Bee and Guocoland didn't respond to e-mail queries from Bloomberg.Developers' home sales have been hurt by the government's campaign to cool property prices in Asia's second-most expensive housing market. Measures since 2009 include a cap on debt repayment costs at 60 per cent of a borrower's monthly income, higher stamp duties and higher real estate taxes.Annual home sales dropped to a six-year low in 2014, halving from the year before, according to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Singapore's home prices dropped for a sixth consecutive quarter in the three months ended March 31, the longest losing streak in more than a decade.\"If they believe that there could be some improvement in the outlook, then they'll probably hold on to their projects,\" Mr Pandey at UOB-Kay Hian said, referring to developers. \"As of now, the chances of an improvement are low. I don't see an immediate pick-up in demand for high-end property due to the property curbs.\"Shares of potential delisting candidates have rallied since Keppel Corp announced the Keppel Land purchase on Jan 23. Wing Tai and Ho Bee surged more than 9 per cent since that day through Wednesday. Guocoland and Wheelock gained over 3 per cent.\"We believe the odds for privatisation are rising for Wing Tai,\" Derrick Heng, an analyst at Maybank Kim Eng, wrote in a note to clients on March 25.Controlling shareholders of Popular Holdings, a bookstore chain operator and developer, made a buyout offer in January before a deadline to sell all units at its condominium project Ei8ht Raja. Hiap Hoe and SingHaiyi Group are among developers that restructured projects.Hiap Hoe in December said its parent will buy the unsold units at its high-end condominium project Treasure on Balmoral near Orchard Road. SingHaiyi Group on April 1 said it will sell its majority stake in Corporate Residence Pte, the developer of the City Suites condominium project.\"Why pay levies or sell at rock bottom prices when we can find other ways like going private,\" said Donald Han, managing director of Chesterton Singapore, a real estate consulting company.BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

On April 29, a 17,035-square-foot freehold site at 15 Binjai Rise that is being redeveloped will go under the hammer at an auction.Market sources say the indicative price is S$20 million, which would work out to S$1,174 per square foot (psf) based on its land area. On the corner site is an uncompleted bungalow that will also have a swimming pool; the redevelopment is approved for 13,378 sq ft gross floor area, according to written permission granted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority.By some estimates, it may cost a further S$1 million to S$2 million to complete the construction. To tear down the existing partially built structure and undertake a fresh construction, the cost would be higher, around S$5 million to S$6 million. The regular-shaped plot has a north-east facing and is located in a cul-de-sac behind the Pan Island Expressway (PIE).The mortgagee (or lender) is believed to be a Hong Kong-based bank. The borrowers are understood to be members of a family who were redeveloping the property for their own occupation.Mortgagee sales of GCBs or GCB sites rarely surface at auctions, say industry watchers. Singapore Christie's Homes managing director Samuel Eyo said this could be due to the fact that \"in recent years, most GCB buyers, whether they have purchased for their own occupation or for investment, have taken only 50-60 per cent loan-to-valuation (LTV), even if they could have qualified for more - as a matter of prudence\".\"Hence if they are stretched and need to sell the property, they have sufficient buffer to divest it themselves at lower-than-market value - without letting the property slip into the hands of the bank.\"And where GCBs do end up at auctions, typically they are put up for sale by their owners, and not the mortgagees. For instance, in 2013, GCBs in locations such as White House Park, Eng Neo Avenue and Chee Hoon Avenue were placed for auction by their owners. Since 2014, though, owners have pulled back from putting their GCBs for auction sale due to the general lull in the GCB market after the introduction of the total debt servicing ratio framework in late-June 2013, say some market observers.GCBs are the most prestigious type of landed housing in Singapore, with strict planning constraints. The last time a GCB property went under the hammer as a mortgagee sale was in 2007, for 3C Swettenham Road. The freehold property sold for S$16.5 million or S$639 psf on its 25,802-sq-ft land area at a July 2007 auction. The property comprised a two-storey bungalow with an attic, a two-storey annex building and a swimming pool.In 2010, No 39/39A Ridout Road had been advertised for auction as a mortgagee sale but was later withdrawn.No 15 Binjai Rise will go under the hammer at Colliers International's auction next Wednesday. RealStar Premier Group managing director William Wong described the S$1,174 psf indicative price for the property as reasonable, given that owners of older completed GCBs in the Binjai area have been asking mostly for S$1,300-S$1,600 psf depending on the condition of the house.\"The pull factor of this property is the pricing. The drawback is the proximity to the PIE resulting in noise. Still, there will be takers; they can do the design to reduce the noise. I also know some GCB owners who keep their windows and doors shut all the time, with 24-hour air-conditioning,\" he added.Industry players believe that 15 Binjai Rise is likely to be a one-off phenomenon and is unlikely to spark a trend of a rise in mortgagee sales of GCBs. \"Most of the clients we are servicing are prudent and buying for own occupation,\" said Mr Eyo.Other properties that will be offered at Colliers' auction next Wednesday, to be held at Amara Hotel, will include a freehold two-storey semi-detached house on a 4,265-sq-ft site along Jalan Bumbong in Kranji. The owner is said be eyeing S$4 million.Buyers keen on an apartment may be interested in a two-bedroom loft unit at Miro at Lincoln Road. The owner is seeking S$2.2 million for the 1,302-sq-ft unit in the freehold development near Newton MRT Station.Another property that will make its auction debut at the Colliers event is a 2,196-sq-ft apartment at Golden Mile Complex on Beach Road comprising three bedrooms, a study and a maid's room on a site with a balance lease term of 53 years. This is a mortgagee sale with an indicative pricing of around S$1.45 million. The 15th-storey unit boasts unblocked river and sea views.Another mortgagee sale property going under the hammer on the same day is a two-storey freehold penthouse with roof terrace at Esterina in Haig Avenue. The indicative pricing for the 2,540-sq-ft unit, which has four bedrooms, is S$2.1 million.According to figures released earlier by Colliers, the number of properties sent to the auction block by lenders increased to 159 last year from 32 in 2013 and 24 in 2012. For Q1 this year, the figure was 56 properties, up from 47 in Q4 last year and 22 in Q1 2014."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Condos completed before that were mostly fully sold in the property market boom, C&W said.The huge jump in numbers from one year to the next is partly due to the way such Qualifying Certificate (QC) charges are calculated: at per annum rates of 8 per cent of the land purchase price for the first year, double that (16 per cent) for the second, and triple that (24 per cent) for the third/subsequent years of extension. The amount is pro-rated according to how many units are unsold.The huge jump is also due to more projects completed (ie received their temporary occupation permit) in 2014 compared to 2013. Since \"foreign\" developers are required to sell their units within two years of completion, more would be incurring these charges in 2016, compared to 2015.The definition of \"foreign\" includes developers with even just one foreign shareholder or director, which is why all listed companies are deemed \"foreign\". The rules are aimed at preventing foreign developers from hoarding or speculating in residential land in Singapore.\"From the policy angle, the intention was to allow developers to build and sell, thus contributing to the housing supply and hopefully a reduction in prices,\" said KPMG Singapore principal tax consultant Leung Yew Kwong. \"Otherwise, developers might simply hold onto their unsold units and wait for prices to go up, or for the cooling measures to be dismantled.\"Among the developers who could incur considerable QC charges these two years are CapitaLand, City Developments (CDL), Wheelock Properties, Wing Tai, Heeton Holdings, and foreign multinational conglomerate China Sonangol.CapitaLand's QC-bearing projects include Urban Resort at Cairnhill Road (which will incur about S$1 million by end-2016); The Interlace at Depot Road (S$20 million by end-2016), and d'Leedon at Leedon Heights (S$13 million by end-2016).CapitaLand stressed that this is only if it does not move any unsold units by then. Also, The Interlace and d'Leedon are among the largest condo projects here with 1,040 and 1,715 units respectively, hence their inevitable bigger number of unsold units.\"As the developments are largely sold, the estimated extension charges for the first year, if payable, are not substantial and constitute only a small fraction or less than 2 per cent of the selling price of the unsold units, and therefore have limited impact on our overall financials,\" it said.Nouvel 18, a luxury project along Anderson Road, a 50-50 joint venture between CDL and Wing Tai, has not been launched yet and so has no sold units. It has until November 2016 to sell the units. In the worst-case scenario where all the units remain unsold, the JV will have to pay up to S$38 million in extension premiums. This amount is pro-rated based on the proportion of unsold units in the project.Wing Tai has another upscale project nearby, Le Nouvel Ardmore, which remains 91 per cent unsold a year after completion. It will incur about S$15 million in charges if sales continue to be dismal.Also in the vicinity is Wheelock's Ardmore 3. The 96 per cent unsold translates to about S$14 million in QC charges by end-2016 if units remain unsold.As for China Sonangol's TwentyOne Angullia Park, 83 per cent was unsold at last count, which means it may incur up to S$19 million in extension fees by end-2016.For the big listed developers, analysts say these charges, while seemingly hefty, make up a minuscule percentage of their market cap and book values and are thus unlikely to make a dent on their financials.Rather, it is the smaller developers such as Heeton that may face a more punishing reality. The developer, about S$160 million in size, has potential QC charges running up to about S$19 million by end-2016 in the worst-case scenario.This is for projects such as iLiv@Grange, Lincoln Suites (built with Koh Brothers, Lian Beng and KSH) and The Boutiq.Just five months away from its two-year deadline in October 2015, Heeton has recently engaged C&W to conduct an expressions of interest exercise to find an en bloc buyer for all 30 units in iLiv@Grange.It received three bids attached with different conditions, and the developer is reviewing its strategy going forward. The project in the plush Grange Road area has not sold a single unit since it was completed in October 2013.C&W research director Christine Li thinks that there is little hope of projects moving by themselves, judging from how some projects here have not sold anything at all in the last two years.\"On the other hand, developers who have been proactive in marketing either individual units or bulk purchases of whole projects have achieved better results,\" she said.As most of the unsold units facing QC charges are in the core central region, Ms Li believes that developers should consider bulk sales or project relaunches, as there is still interest in the high-end segment from both institutional and retail investors.There are not many other options a developer hoping to avoid QC charges has left. Already, the possibility of converting homes to serviced apartments to wait out the slow market has been ruled out, after the Singapore Land Authority said such developers would not be absolved from the two-year deadline and extension charges.Lee Liat Yeang, real estate lawyer at Rodyk & Davidson, said that developers need to do the math. \"If the QC company has a few units left, it might wish to consider selling the units off at a bargain discount. After all, such units will contribute to profits and it makes sense to just clear them and move on.\"The two other options are to go the \"Hiap Hoe route\" (ie selling units to the parent firm) or the \"SC Global route\" (ie delisting).\"The QC company's holding company might wish to set up an investment company to buy the leftover units, but such purchases will attract buyer's stamp duty and additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) accordingly. The controlling individual shareholders who are Singaporeans or permanent residents can also buy at lower ABSD rates (compared to foreigners),\" Mr Lee said.Developers also need to weigh other costs, such as whether QC charges in their first year will exceed the stamp duties they have to pay, bearing in mind that if the units remain unsold a year later, the QC charges will double and there is no way of knowing how the property market will fare then, said Mr Leung from KPMG.He also thinks that developers' method of delisting or changing their ownership to Singaporean just to escape QC charges defeats the policy's original intention, which was to add to housing supply and correct prices.Amendment: An earlier version of this article said that iLiv@Grange was co-built by Heeton and Soilbuild. Soilbuild was not involved in the development. The article has been amended to reflect this."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

These peak seasons may arise whenbuyersofexecutive condominium (EC)dispose their existing HDB flats once they receive keys to their new homes. For instance, more than 6,000 EC units are expected to be completed in 2018, putting the year in the alert zone. Under HDB rule, upgraders mustsell their existing HDB flatwithin six months from the issuance of the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) for the EC. Buyers whose ECs received TOP in 1Q15, for example, would have to sell their existing HDB flat by 3Q15. Such restriction could result in a surge of HDB resale flats entering the market in certain seasons, tipping the market in favour of buyers and putting sellers in a disadvantaged position. Surveys on certain EC projects showed that such upgraders may account for more than half of new EC buyers. An anticipated 8,800 HDB resale flats therefore could enter the market from now until 4Q19, based on half the 18,083 EC units receiving TOP between 4Q14 and 4Q19. The bulk of these or 3,400 resale flats will come on-stream in 2018, followed by 1,800 units in 2016 (see Table 1 and Figure 1). To put things in perspective, they represent 20% and 11% of total HDB resale volume in 2014 respectively. Table 1: Estimated TOP dates of EC projects and disposal of HDB flats Source: Developers, HDB, URA, The Edge Property Against this backdrop, sellers might consider putting their units on the market this year instead of 2016 to avoid head-on collision with these upgraders. Another incentive in favour of selling this year would be the clipping of Build-To-Order (BTO) supply from 22,455 units in 2014 to 16,900 in 2015. This could potentially draw buyers back to the resale market and reverse the downtrend in prices. According to latest statistics from HDB,prices of resale flatshave declined for seven consecutive quarters for a total of 9.2% from 2Q13s peak to 1Q15. Figure 1: Projected supply of HDB resale flats disposed by EC buyers Source: HDB, URA, The Edge Property Those looking to sell on a longer time horizon might wish to note several window periods where supply from upgraders would be on a low ebb such as the second half of 2017. Barring any changes in market sentiments, it might be prudent for sellers to err on the side of caution and avoid peak periods that might psychologically empower buyers and put pressure on prices. The year 2018 will see a strong surge in supply from upgraders of ECs that are currently being marketed such asThe Amore,Bellewaters,Bellewoods,Lake LifeandThe Terrace. Eight more EC projects are expected to be launched this year. This article appeared in The Edge Property Pullout of Issue 677 (May 18) of The Edge Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Its significance drew from its connections and its involvement in \"unusual\" financial transactions - the forward share contracts that may, or may not, have been genuine. Its connections reached into the heart of the Malaysian government but, more significantly for Singapore, it involved several thousand small shareholders, who had assumed that the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) regulated listing more carefully. Thus it was a political scandal in the making - locally and across the Causeway.The jitters that started with suspension reached fever pitch as facts and rumours emerged after Nov 19. By Nov 30, it was clear to all interested parties (except the small shareholders, who screamed about a cover-up) that Pan-El was dead and it went into receivership.The Singapore (and Malaysian) authorities were sufficiently concerned that the stock markets of both countries were closed for the next three working days. The move was to calm nerves as too many people feared a run on the market and some sort of financial meltdown. In retrospect, this was quite unlikely, given that the big counters were both closely held and mainly related to the governments.

Prices need to drop by about 20 per cent to 30 per cent to make residential investments attractive again, he said in an interview.\"We bought in 2011 and then the policies came in,\" Mr Chiaranussatti said referring an additional stamp duty introduced that year to cool home prices that had reached a record. \"The intensity and the severity of the policies caught us by surprise.\" SC Capital, which manages US$1.8 billion in real estate assets, booked S$12 million in losses when it sold 18 units at the upscale Patterson Suites condominium project to Blackstone in January for S$2,100 a square foot after acquiring the properties for about S$2,300 in 2011, he said.Home prices across the island fell for a sixth consecutive quarter in the first three months of the year, the longest losing streak in more than a decade. Prices in prime districts, with a high proportion of luxury properties, declined 0.6 percent in the period.Since 2009, Singapore moved to stem a surge in the property market that was fueling discontent in the city-state of 5.5 million people. The measures included taxes as high as 15 per cent of the purchase price for foreigners.Prices of luxury homes - defined as those larger than 1,500 square foot and costing above S$2,400 per square foot - have dropped at least 20 per cent since the start of 2013, the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore estimates.Still, Mr Chiaranussatti, who started SC Capital in 2004, doesn't see the government removing property curbs for the next two years.\"With interest rates on the way up, there will be pressure,\" Chiaranussatti said. \"The policy is working, there is no reason whatsoever for the government to relax it.\" The three-month Singapore interbank offered rate, against which most home loans are benchmarked, topped 1 per cent earlier this year before settling at 0.82 per cent, almost double the rate at the end of 2014. Every percentage point increase in interbank rates raises repayments on a S$1 million property by 12 per cent, assuming an 80 per cent loan-to-value ratio and a 25- year loan duration, according Maybank Kim Eng Securities.Others are betting on a removal of the curbs. Blackstone Chief Executive Officer Steven Schwarzman said in March that the Singapore restrictions would be lifted over time.The world's biggest private-equity fund bought a 10-story apartment block in addition to the units at Patterson Suites, while a group of Singapore investors in January bought 16 units at a condominium project off the Orchard Road shopping strip.SC Capital's Chiaranussatti says he expects some investment opportunities to arise over the next couple of years when prices decline further because mass-market home prices haven't dropped as much as those for luxury housing. Mass-market homes have slid only as much as 5 per cent, according to Knight Frank LLP.Units in prime areas like Patterson are selling for S$2,100 per square foot, while condos in the suburbs are fetching S$1,600 a square foot, Mr Chiaranussatti said.\"Today, if I can go back to Patterson Suites and buy at S$1,900 a square foot then I would,\" he said.BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Rather, it is in some ways a function of the soft retail property market and instability stemming from leadership changes in the company at the global level, they said.Last August, Piers Brunner resigned as chief executive officer of Asia; in February, Colliers named David Hand as its new chief executive for the Asia-Pacific.Then on June 1, Colliers announced its completed spin-off from FirstService Corp, which makes it an independent, publicly traded company on the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange.Soon after, global president and chief executive Doug Frye resigned without a reason.Mr Yeo said: \"There's some turbulence up there.\"He added that while this doesn't have a significant impact on those lower down the food chain, it does - when coupled with a weak market - create ripe conditions for competitors to take advantage of the situation and poach its employees to fill their own expertise gaps.\"For our office and industrial departures, they were because of pull factors and the lure of money, rather than push factors. Our industry is an incentive-driven one,\" he said.Colliers' greatest strength is its industrial-leasing capability, built up over two decades here, said Mr Yeo, disclosing that his industrial team had received several offers. \"I wanted to retain them. We hate to lose them, but unfortunately, the offer to them was something we could not, and, as a corporate, would not, match.\"Market sources told The Business Times that the three directors from the office-services department - Marcus Loo, Greg Marler and Ashley Swan - were offered sign-on bonuses of about S$5 million in total.Brenda Ong and Rimon Ambarchi, among the five brokers poached from the industrial services team, were offered sign-on bonuses of \"a couple of millions\" combined.For Mr Nonis, who is moving to JLL with brokers David Fernando, Shafiq Zulazmi and analyst Ho Pui Shan, it is a matter of going to where the projects are.He said: \"It's not a poaching exercise. JLL has exciting projects representing landlords at OUE Downtown, South Beach and Tanjong Pagar Centre, whereas at Colliers, we didn't have any landlord representation work. We did a couple of very boutique, non-mall projects in shophouses. There was no CDL (City Developments), no Pontiac, no Wheelock.\"JLL is the leasing agent for the retail component of the mixed-use developments. The four new hires will contribute their specialist expertise in food and beverage - built from intellectual property that they earlier developed - and their strong client base.Mr Nonis added: \"It has nothing to do with the way Colliers is run. In fact, its structure is good. It's just unfortunate that it's like a triple whammy for them and we happen to be on the bandwagon to move to JLL.\"Mr Yeo agreed that the four are leaving probably because they have found it difficult to perform at Colliers in the moribund market. He is not looking to fill the vacancies; he prefers to hire opportunistically, given that the current team of about four will be able to handle the workload.He is also not planning to aggressively refill the 10 to 12 places for brokers on each of the industrial and office-services team for the same reasons.To his knowledge, there are no other imminent departures after this.Asked about staff morale, Mr Yeo replied that it has taken a hit more from the weakness of the market than the departures.\"Of course, we will have our own strategy. Our Asia-Pacific CEO just came on board, so give him time; he will probably respond.\"A lot is happening in Colliers right now, both globally and in Asia. Those who think they cannot wait out to hear what the management has for the company will choose to leave,\" he reasoned.Over at JLL, the retail team, including directors Lee Siew Ling and Tom Hamilton, will be 11 strong with the four hires from Colliers. They will focus on covering all aspects of retail, with special emphasis on new-to-market brands, project leasing and food and beverage. (New-to-market brands and project leasing are JLL's hallmark strengths.)The team reports to Chris Archibold, who is international director and head of markets.Chris Fossick, managing director for Singapore and South-east Asia, said the move is in line with the firm's plans to strengthen its agency business in Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The preview saw 149 (93%) of 160 units released sold, according to URA data, with transaction prices ranging from US$1,627 psf to US$2,245 psf or at an average of about US$1,900 psf. Following the preview of the project, the showflat has since been closed. There are no plans to re-launch the project as yet, according to a source. Whether Keppel Land will adjust the selling prices of the 500-unit, 99-year leaseholdcondoon Kim Tian Road remains to be seen. After all, the developer paid a record US$550.8 million ($1,163 psf per plot ratio) for the site in April 2013. Property consultants like Nicholas Mak, executive director of research & consultancy had estimated then that the breakeven cost for the project would be around US$1,700 psf to US$1,800 psf. Therefore Highline Residences selling prices are not expected to be lower than the average price of US$1,900 psf, according to a property agent. Whether it will be higher than the average of $1,900 psf achieved to date remains to be seen Highline Residences will therefore maintain the benchmark pricing for the Tiong Bahru area despite the current downbeat market conditions, says Tim Ong of ERA Realty. This could explain why there have been very few transactions in the Tiong Bahru area in the first six months of 2015 as some sellers of private condo units hold on to their asking prices. Some home sellers continue to have inflated price expectations, notes SLPs Mak. However, he cautions that this might not be the best strategy as homebuyers and tenants searching for a city fringe location within close proximity to an MRT station have many choices. In the current market, both buyers and tenants are price sensitive. Homebuyers also continue to face tighter loan restrictions and uncertainty about what lies ahead in terms of the property measures and loan limits being relaxed, among other factors, he adds. Despite Tiong Bahrus bohemian lifestyle offerings, the neighbourhood is facing stiff competition from other up-and-coming city fringe locations like Dakota, Lavender andPotong Pasir, observes Mak. This is reflected in the recent resale of a unit at the 99-year leasehold condoMeraprimelocated at Jalan Bukit Ho Swee. The 213-unit development by MCL Land was launched in 2004 at an average price of US$600 psf. The project completed in 2006, is located behind Tiong Bahru Plaza and a short walk to theTiong Bahru MRT station. The recent transaction was for the resale of am 18th floor 1,173 sq ft three-bedroom unit that changed hands for US$1.67 million (US$1,423 psf) in early June. The unit last changed hands in 2010 for US$1.55 million (US$1,321 psf). Even rents have come off in the Tiong Bahru area. A three-bedroom unit of that size could command monthly rental rates of US$5,800 back at the peak in 2012. Today, rental rates of such units are hovering around the US$5,000 mark, notes ERAs Ong. AtTwin Regency, a 234-unit freehold private condo by UOL Group and completed in 2007, there were two resales this year one in February and the other in May, according to caveats lodged with URA Realis. The unit in February that had changed hands was a 1,776 sq ft four-bedroom unit on the 22nd level of one of the 36-storey towers. It was sold for US$2.3 million (US$1,295 psf). It was last purchased in 2007 for US$1.9 million (US$1,070 psf) when the project was newly completed. The most recent transaction at Twin Regency was the sale of a 2,121 sq ft penthouse that changed hands for US$2.95 million (US$1,391 psf). The former was a 2,121 sq ft penthouse that changed hands for US$2.95 million (US$1,391 psf). The unit was first purchased for US$1.51 million (US$712 psf) in 2006, hence the owner still saw a capital gain of 95.3% in nearly a decade. Meanwhile atCentral Green Condo, located adjacent to Twin Regency, a unit on the 14th floor of one of the three residential blocks was sold for US$1.59 million (US$1,233 psf). The 1,292 sq ft three-bedroom unit was last purchased for 2002 for US$760,000 (US$588 psf), hence the seller saw the value of his property double over the last 13 years.

In the next hour, raspy-voiced rocker Ramli Sarip brought the house down with his classic hit Kamelia.Any lover of local music would be dazzled by the sheer star wattage at Leo Studio, where more than a dozen established and emerging musicians assembled to rehearse for Sing50.The Aug 7 concert organised by The Business Times and The Straits Times will see more than four dozen iconic music makers from across five decades performing at the National Stadium in celebration of local music.JJ Lin, Dick Lee, Jacintha Abisheganaden, Tracy Huang, The Oddfellows, Douglas O and Najip Ali are just a few of the household names appearing on stage.

The sale worked out to $185 million or $1,789 psf for the development. This has had an impact on prices of neighbouring new condominiums launched in the Balmoral area, leading to transactions drying up for much of the first six months of the year. For example, next door to Treasure on Balmoral isThree Balmoral, a 40-unit freehold boutique condominium project by Tong Eng Group. The 12-storey project contains only one-bedroom-plus study units with sizes starting from 614 sq ft and three-bedroom units above 1,500 sq ft. Sales of Three Balmoral started in Oct 2011, and only seven of 20 units launched have been sold to date, according to URA data. The latest recorded sale was on June 15, for a 1,539 sq ft three-bedroom unit on the eighth floor that was sold for $3.4 million ($2,209 psf), according to URA Realis. The price psf is the lowest seen in the project to date as the earlier recorded transactions from Oct 2011 to April 2013 ranged from $2,388 psf to $2,608 psf, observes Ssamuel Eyo, managing director of Singapore Christies Homes. Hiap Hoe Ltd, which is a public listed company, was pressured to sell under the conditions of the Qualifying Certificate (QC) which requires all foreign companies (which includes listed companies) to sell all the units in their residential developments within two years of completion to avoid paying a penalty for any unsold units. The privately held Tong Eng Group on the other hand is not subject to the QC, and is therefore in no hurry to sell off the units. The group also has the holding power to ride through the current period of slow sales, adds Eyo. Located on the opposite side of the road from Three Balmoral is another freehold condominium by Tong Eng Group. CalledGoodwood Grand, the freehold project contains a condominium block of 65 units and eight stratabungalows. The project was launched for sale in December 2013. Of 31 units released, 26 units have been sold, with the latest transaction recorded in May at a median price of $2,563 psf, according to URA data. Likewise, Goodwood Grands price level is also being affected by another listed group, GuocoLand, which has been selling the remaining units at its 210-unitGoodwood Residencelocated off Bukit Timah Road. The project was completed in 2013, and the developer has sold 27 units, with three-bedroom units sized from 1,948 sq ft to 2,142 sq ft sold at prices ranging from $2,181 psf to $2,614 psf; and four-bedroom units from 2,454 sq ft to 2,928 sq ft offloaded at prices of $2,413 psf to $2,678 psf, based on caveats lodged with URA Realis from January to June 2015 to date. The price psf range of Goodwood Residence which is trading at $2,400 psf to $2,600 psf serves as a rough ballpark pricing for many of the newer developments with larger unit layouts of three- and four-bedroom types, notes Aldric Tan, senior associate director of CBRE Realty Associates. CBREs Tan attributes the lack of transactions for both Three Balmoral and Goodwood Grand to the absence of a proper showflat on site as construction of both projects are already well underway. Without a proper showflat, buyers cant visualise the unit layout and orientation, he explains. And people are more reluctant to commit to a purchase without seeing an actual showflat. If there are serious buyers, Tong Eng is willing to negotiate with them on pricing on a case-by-case basis and willing to offer discounts from 3% to 5%, notes CBREs Tan. On the opposite side of Balmoral Road diagonally opposite Goodwood Grand isBelmond Green, a 211-unit freehold condominium developed by CapitaLand and completed in 2004. The latest resale was for a 1,335 sq ft three-bedroom unit on the ninth floor that changed hands for $2.35 million ($1,723 psf), according to a caveat lodged on June 8. The unit last changed hands in 2006 for $1.3 million ($996 psf), hence the seller saw the price of the unit appreciate almost two fold in under a decade. According to CBREs Tan, Belmond Greens resale prices are affected by the recent transaction prices atHallmark Residences, a recently completed project located behind it on Ewe Boon Road. At Hallmark Residences, a 75-unit high-end condominium by MCL Land, the two latest transactions were for two ground floor units that were sold for $3.13 million ($1,773 psf) and $2.92 million ($1,739 psf). The lower price psf could be due to the private enclosed space of the ground floor units or the developer willing to shave off the price to clear the last few units, suggests Tan. As of end May, there were only three unsold units at Hallmark Residences, based on URA data. Meanwhile the lower price psf of Belmond Green - where four units had changed hands this year at prices ranging from $1,635 psf to $1,723 psf - may be proving attractive to buyers shopping in the resale market, notes Bruce Lye, managing partner of SRI5000, a division of SLP Realty. Belmond Green is not as old as some of the other developments in the area, for examplePalm Spring,Crystal TowerandEwe Boon Regentwhich were built in the 1970s to 1990s. So Belmond Green appears relatively new in comparison, he adds. On an a quantum basis, units at Belmond Green look more affordable compared to those of Hallmark Residences which are larger in size and have a higher price psf given that the project is new.

A 1,959 sq ft, four-bedroom unit in the same block was also sold in June. It fetched $4.225 million ($2,157 psf), or 14% below the sellers purchase price of $4.9 million ($2,501 psf) in September 2009. The original owner paid $4.608 million ($2,353 psf) for the unit in June 2006, when St Regis Residences was launched. Both transactions bring the total resale deals at the 173-unit luxurycondoto nine so far this year. Eight of them registered a double-digit loss for the respective sellers. The good news is that rich investors appear to think that St Regis Residences looks like a good buy at $2,000 to $2,200 psf levels, observes Ku Swee Yong, CEO of Century 21. My concern is that, with so many ultra-high-net-worth investors willing to offload their luxury property investments at a loss, it could affect Singapores reputation as an investment hub for the rich. The most spectacular drop was experienced bya 6,017 sq ft duplex penthouse, which saw its price plunge from $28 million ($4,653 psf) at its peak in May 2007 to $12.2 million ($2,028 psf) in March this year, although no caveat was lodged for the latest sale. The penthouse set the record price for St Regis Residences in terms of both absolute and psf prices when it changed hands in a sub-sale eight years ago. St Regis Residences achieved several firsts when it was launched, says Ku. It was the first project where prices crossed the $3,000 psf threshold and also the first to smash the $4,000 psf barrier. Jerry Low, senior marketing director of ERA Realty, reckons there could be more transactions that are at least 5% to 10% below the current market price of $2,100 to $2,200 psf. Most of these sellers are people who are cashing out, as they have multiple properties and face refinancing issues as a result of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR), he explains. St Regis Residences is located in twin 23-storey towers located behind the 299-room St Regis Hotel onTanglin Road. The joint developers for the hotel and luxury residences are Hong Leong Holdings, City Developments and TID Pte Ltd (a joint venture between Hong Leong and Mitsui Fudosan). The 999-year leasehold project was completed in 2008, at the onset of the global financial crisis. So far, the developer is still holding on to 12 unsold units. Nine are currently leased, and the remaining three are available for sale. The three units are believed to be four-bedroom apartments, and ERAs Low is currently marketing one of them at a price tag of $6.4 million, or about $3,000 psf. The developers asking price is well above current market resale prices. Low says, The developer has high holding power. It is willing to entertain any offers by serious buyers and negotiate on the final price. Rents have also been weakening, with the Core Central Region experiencing the sharpest contraction, at 1.9% q-o-q in 1Q2015, according to CBRE in a report on May 25. Increased stock in the CCR [is] the main reason for the sharp rental decline, Joseph Tan, executive director of residential at CBRE, comments in the report. The CCR, which traditionally has the highest supply of rental stock, was hit by the shrinking budget of expatriates and the availability of newer accommodation at more attractive rents. CCR covers the traditional prime districts of9,10and11, as well as the new prime districts ofMarina BayandSentosa Cove. Rents at St Regis Residences have likewise been on a downward trend. Leland Yong, associate branch director at PropNex Realty, says: Asking monthly rental rates of four-bedroom units are now at $10,000 to $12,000 compared with the peak from 2010 to 2013, when asking rents ranged from $12,000 to $15,000. Most of the interest in the four-bedroom units at St Regis is coming from European expatriates. Jason Loke, associate director of OrangeTee.com, says, Im not too concerned with competition from neighbouring developments, as St Regis is a reputable brand and the only hotel-branded residences in the neighbourhood. Four-bedroom units on the high floors are still posting asking rents of $12,000 to $13,000 a month.

A 527 sq ft, one-bedroom unit and three 775 sq ft, two-bedroom units were sold. Prices of the units sold ranged from $682,000 ($1,293 psf) to$1.122 million ($1,448 psf), according to caveats lodged from July 5 to 12. The developer of Kingsford Hillview Peak is offering discounts of 20% to 22% off the list price To spur transactions in the development, the developer is offering a discount of 20% to 22% off the list price, starting from this month. Prior to that, units were sold at $1,300 to $1,400 psf. However, post-discount, the new selling price is around $1,200 psf, according to ERA real-estate agents who are marketing the project. The 512-unit private condominium by mainland Chinese developer Kingsford Development was launched in 2013. As at end-June, 172 units had been sold, according to URA data. The developer purchased the 99-year leasehold site in January 2012 for$243.22 million, or $638 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr), which is comparable to the $673 psf ppr paid by Far East Organization for an adjacent 99-yearleasehold site in 2011. The project has since been developed intoThe Hillier. Kingsford Development had snapped up the site at Hillview Rise, following the success of the launch of The Hillier in January 2012. Within a few weeks, 210 out of 333 units released were snapped up, at an average price of $1,174 psf. The Hillier, which was completed last year, consists of 520 units of SOHO-style residences sitting atop a double-storey retail and lifestyle mall called HillV2. The project is fully sold, and was completed last year. The last recorded transaction was in March last year, when an 818 sq ft unit on the seventh floor was sold for just over$1 million ($1,229 psf). One of the main draws of The Hillier and Kingsford Hillview Peak is the upcoming Hillview MRT station, which is scheduled to be completed by year-end, says Daniel Liew, an associate director at ERA Realty. HillV2is also a draw for those living in the neighbourhood and residents of Kingsford Hillview Peak will likewise benefit from the projects proximity to the shopping mall, which contains F&B outlets, clinics and a childcare centre, Liew adds. Some of the tenants include New York gourmet grocers Dean & DeLuca and premium confectioners Cold Stone Creamery. The pricing of the one- and two-bedroom units at Kingsford Hillview Peak, which is just above $600,000 to over$1 million, has also attracted investors, notes Liew. The project comprises win 12-storey blocks, which are currently under construction and expected to be completed by end-2016 or early 2017.

For those who are less familiar with the local property regulations, condos must have a minimum site area of 0.4ha to ensure sufficient space for facilities and greenery, among other parameters stipulated by URA. They are, therefore, perceived to be a higher-value private housing product, a notch above apartments. District 15 accounted for the bulk of the freehold apartment transactions outside the prime districts. These apartments dot the lanes branching out of Joo Chiat Road, Still Road and Telok Kurau Road. Many of them are low-rise, single-block projects with more basic facilities such as a small pool, gymnasium and clubhouse. Given their lack of facilities and green spaces, have apartments suffered a bigger setback in the ongoing property melee? Demand for freehold apartments is underpinned by their niche positioning. Freehold apartments offer value alternatives for buyers coveting a private address in District 15. In our basket of properties, prices of freehold apartments between 700 and 1,100 sq ft in the district, completed from 2000 onwards, averaged $1,248 psf, a significant discount to their freehold and 99-year leasehold condo counterparts in the area, which traded at $1,603 psf and $1,428 psf respectively. Separately, the average price of these freehold apartments is on par with some 99-year leasehold mass-market projects. It seems there is also limited stock of smaller-sized and affordable condos in District 15. Therefore, apartments in the area fill the gap between public and private homes for buyers with tighter budgets. Based on caveats lodged in 2014 and 2015, the average condo size in the district was 1,383 sq ft, and around 80% of the caveats involved units larger than 1,000 sq ft. On the other hand, the average size of apartments sold in 2014 and 2015 1,096 sq ft is smaller relative to condos. Freehold apartments also appeal to those willing to trade off full condo facilities for exclusivity and tranquillity. Despite standing on compact land parcels, these apartments are nested among landed homes in a low 1.4 plot ratio neighbourhood, based on Master Plan 2014. A lifestyle retail concept adds character to the neighbourhood, in place of traditional suburban malls. The average size of apartments in District 15 is smaller than condos in the area, making them more affordable A lifestyle retail comcept adds character to the neighbourhood, in place of traditional suburban malls The Edge Property found that prices of freehold apartments in District 15 have stayed relatively resilient against market headwinds. Analyses of a basket of freehold apartments in the area showed that the average price for units between 700 and 1,100 sq ft eased about 2%, from $1,267 psf at its peak in 1H2013 to $1,248 psf today. For comparison, the URA price index for all non-landed homes in the city fringe or Rest of Central Region (RCR) dipped 8% around the same period. Only four of the 29 properties surveyed saw prices falling at a rate close to or faster than 8%. In our analysis, prices in 1H2013 were derived based on actual transactions from caveats lodged with URA, while prices in 2015 were derived using Edge Fair Value, a valuation tool on TheEdgeProperty.com. It allows us to track the price movement of the same units between 1H2013 and today, despite a limited number of transactions. For example, an 850 sq ft low-floor unit at Tivoli Grande apartment was transacted at $1,423 psf in 1H2013. Edge Fair Value puts the price of the unit at $1,424 psf today. The tool utilises a valuation algorithm that takes into account variables, such as recent transactions of comparable properties, level, facing, size and outliers, in formulating the values. Using Edge Fair Value to derive the market rents for the same batch of units put the rental yields of these freehold apartments at 3.3%. In an up market, the prices of freehold apartments in District 15 have appreciated at similar rates as non-landed home prices in the city fringe or RCR. For example, an 872 sq ft low-floor unit at Callidora Ville in Telok Kurau was traded at $786 psf in June 2009. A similar unit in the project changed hands at $1,262 psf in June 2013. In another example, a 1,000-plus sq ft unit at One @ Pulasan was sold at $809 psf in March 2009. In June 2013, a similar unit in the project found a buyer at $1,122 psf.

Will enhanced advertisement guidelines be enough? Can more be done to rein in marketing agents flogging questionable overseas projects? Enhanced guidelines for property investment advertisements and investment seminars introduced by the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore Council took effect from Aug 12. The ASAS Council said it had observed an increase in advertisements, including those of investments in overseas properties that promise high or guaranteed returns, but that they often lack sufficient warnings against any financial, legal or regulatory risks. Between January 2013 and May 2015, ASAS had received 41 feedback cases about advertisements by companies that offer training as well as tips on investing in financial instruments and properties. Of particular concern was investment in overseas properties. Of the 41 cases, 12 had involved advertisements on overseas property investment that contained non-substantiated claims. The enhanced guidelines will go some way towards protecting investors. However, for those who had fallen prey to such advertisements, the measures by ASAS may have come a little too late. A year ago, many of the investors in Singapore who bought rooms in the Ibis budget hotels in Knutsford and Warrington Lymm, near Manchester in the UK, figured they were onto a good thing. They were lured by advertisements claiming guaranteed 24% nett return over three years and 109% guaranteed buyback. One such investor, who only wants to be known as Nick, saw the advertisement on Ibis Warrington Lymm on July 13, and attended the property seminar that Saturday together with his wife. The returns dangled that day were even sweeter than what was advertised, with offers of 9% return a year and 115% buyback at the end of three years. The price of a hotel room at Ibis Warrington Lymm was 94,500, which translated into about $200,000 then. What convinced us to buy were the high returns, the assurance that it was a completed project and, more importantly, because of DWG [Dennis Wee Group], which we thought was a very reputable marketing agency, says Nick. He signed the option to purchase and paid the booking fee of $4,000 (2,000) on July 13. As the advertisement had said, Meet the developer, Nick asked who the developer was. He was introduced to Lee Bramzell, founder and director of Shepherd Cox, who made a presentation on the project that day. They should have just told us the developer couldnt make it, but here is the marketing agent from the UK, says Nick. Instead, DWG introduced Shepherd Cox as the developer. He and many of the other investors were therefore taken aback a month later when Hotel Options (Lymm) Ltd was listed as the vendor on the sale and purchase agreement. We asked our DWG agent who Hotel Options was, and we were told that it is a company linked to Shepherd Cox that had been set up to operate the hotel, says Nick. Taking the agents word for it, he signed the agreement and paid the remaining 92,500. He recalls that it was on National Day, Aug 9 last year. Alarm bells didnt set off then because he started receiving the promised monthly rental return of 9% (708) over the next few months. A strong startAnother Singaporean investor, Mr Goh, had also purchased a room at Ibis Warrington Lymm. He remembers the exact date that he received his first rental payment as it was on his wifes birthday, Oct 2, 2014. At the end of the same month, he received the second payment, which was due for November. I thought it was such a good investment, and that my hotel room was doing very well, says the 52-year-old Goh. I didnt suspect anything. Instead, he had imagined that he and his two sons, aged 21 and 19, could visit London on a father-son bonding trip and drive to Manchester and Liverpool to watch football matches. Goh figured that even if things went bad, he would still be the owner of a hotel room, even if it is a budget hotel on the M6 motorway to Manchester. Goh remembers receiving his monthly payments for December and January. But there was no payment in February. In March, as no payment was forthcoming, he called the agent from DWG. She referred him to DWGs legal department, which is basically just one person, Anil Dube [the legal counsel of DWG], recalls Goh. Before he could contact Dube, however, he received an email from the UK legal practitioners specialising in corporate recovery and insolvency, Begbies Traynor, informing him that Hotel Options (Lymm) had been put into administration. The notice was dated March 13, and the company had been put into administration the day before. When things like that happen, theres nothing much you can do, but sit down and weigh your options, he says philosophically. Dubious or ill-conceived plan?It was only upon perusing the administrators statement of proposals filed by Begbies Traynor on May 5 that the investors of Ibis Lymm learnt what transpired before they came into the picture. Hotel Options (Lymm) was set up on June 6, 2013 by four shareholders in the UK, each holding 25 shares in the company worth 1 each. The same shareholders had also set up another company, Hotel Options (Knutsford), on June 5, 2013. The shareholders of both companies purchased two existing hotel buildings and proceeded to refurbish them. They then acquired a franchise from Accor Group to run the properties as Ibis Budget Knutsford and Ibis Budget Warrington Lymm Services, according to a press release by Accor in April 2014. The shareholders of Hotel Options (Lymm) and Hotel Options (Knutsford) engaged Shepherd Cox as the marketing agent to sell the individual rooms of both hotel properties. The rooms were sold primarily to investors in Singapore and the Far East. They would then be leased back to the hotel management company, which in turn would manage the properties and generate an investment return for the individual hotel room investors, according to the administrators report. Shepherd Cox was to receive a commission for the sale of the rooms, and upon achieving a certain sales target within a specified time period, it would have the right to purchase the Ibis hotel at Knutsford, according to legal practitioners Marshall Peters, the administrator for Hotel Options (Knutsford). For the property at Lymm, if Shepherd Cox achieved a certain level of sales within a specific time frame, the hotel would be transferred to an associate company of Shepherd Cox called SCX Lymm Ltd that was set up for that purpose. Shepherfd Cox had raised the required finance to complete the purchase. However, sometime in November 2014, a dispute arose between Shepherd Cox and the shareholders of Hotel Options (Knutsford) and (Lymm), mainly over the payment of commissions and whether the minimum sales target had been achieved within the stipulated time frame, according to the administrators report. Consequently, Shepherd Cox took legal action against both Hotel Options (Knutsford) and (Lymm). At Ibis Budget Knutsford, of a total of 32 rooms, 30 were purchased by investors in Singapore and two by UK investors. The price they paid per room was 82,500 and the same 8% rental yield was promised, with annual gross rental of 6,600 and monthly rental of 550, according to the administrators statement of proposals filed on March 27. When Hotel Options (Knutsford) was unable to pay its debts, a decision was taken to appoint an administrator and a notice of its intention to do so was filed in court on Jan 22. Clive Morris of Marshall Peters Ltd was appointed the administrator of the company on Feb 5. Unachievable promised returnsAccording to Marshall Peters report in March, while Hotel Ibis Knutsford was viable as a going concern, it was unable to generate enough revenue to cover the monthly rental payments due to the investors. The administrator there fore approached the investors to consent to a waiver of their rental payments during the administration period. Subsequently, when Hotel Options (Lymm) was put into administration in March, the same request was made to investors to waive their entitled rent during the eight-week administration period. The Ibis Budget Lymm has 61 rooms, of which 29 were purchased by 21 investors from Singapore and 32 by those from Taiwan. Most of the investors in Singapore had agreed to the waiver. Similar to the Ibis Knutsford, while the Ibis Lymm could generate a tiny profit and break even operationally, this was insufficient to meet the promised rental returns due to the individual investors based on the 8% rental yield, which would translate into about 40,000 a month ,which would render profitable trade impossible, according to the administrators. According to an investor who only wants to be known as Mr Tan, the investors were told that they could buy the freehold title if they wanted to. Tan and his wife were the biggest investors of the two Ibis budget hotels, having purchased two rooms at Knutsford and four at Lymm for a total of over $1 million. Tan, along with the other Singaporean investors at Ibis Knutsford, was keen to purchase the freehold title of the property. Buying the freehold title meant that they could appoint their own hotel management company. They were even willing to negotiate with Accor Group to have the contract renewed so the hotel could continue operating under the Ibis Budget brand. Many hours were spent speaking to the administrators, according to Tan. He was told that the freehold title for the Ibis Knutsford would cost 20,000, while the freehold title for the hotel at Lymm was about 40,000. The Singaporean investors therefore submitted a bid of 21,000 for the freehold title of the Knutsford property. We thought we would get the freehold title, but at the eleventh hour, we were told by the administrator that Shepherd Cox has the freehold title for Knutsford and has since taken hold of the freehold title for Lymm as well, says Tan. The investors, meanwhile, own a 978-year leasehold title on the individual hotel rooms. Ibis budget hotel in Knutsford Two cities, different outcomesThe investors of Ibis Lymm in Singapore also learnt that Taiwanese investors in the same property appeared to have got a better deal, thanks to their agent. The investors in Taiwan had continued to receive their 8% return, as Shepherd Cox and the intermediary in Taiwan had deposited 60,000 to cover potential rental costs, according to the administrators report. In the final progress report, another 20,000 was deposited with the instructed solicitors by the Taiwan intermediary. The Taiwanese creditors had difficulty providing the waiver due to translation issues, and the fact that there are no analogous proceedings to an administration in Taiwan, said administrator Begbies Traynor in its final progress report on July 3. The Taiwan intermediary, Joe Yang, CEO of Soufun Taiwan, said as none of the investors in Taiwan spoke English, he had to represent them. Yang had marketed the Ibis Lymm hotel to the investors in Taiwan, and his firm is said to be the leading firm when it comes to marketing overseas property. Soufun has been able to continue paying the investors in Taiwan, as the company had taken out a 100,000 insurance policy to protect its investors in case problems arose with the transactions, explains Yang. He is also negotiating with Shepherd Cox to keep the same rental guarantee of 8% for his Taiwanese investors. The investors in Singapore were naturally disappointed that DWG had not protected them in the same way. In fact, according to an investor who wants to be known as Jeanette, they received their title deeds from the Land Registry only after repeated emails and calls. If you are a real estate agent and I sign my sale and purchase agreement, you should make sure that I get my title deed and that I get the returns I signed up for, she says. Now, all Im interested in is getting my capital back. Unfortunately, it looks like she and her fellow investors might have simply paid too much. I asked Shepherd Cox how they arrived at the price of 94,500, and Lee [Bramzell] said they calculated it based on the projected room rates multiplied by the number of days and the number of years and used a present value model to arrive at the price of the room, recounts an investor who only wants to be known as Peter. Im still holding on to two rooms [in Ibis Lymm], but I wonder how much they are worth today. Ibis budget hotel in Warrington Lymm Investments gone wrongThe investors in Ibis Lymm arent the only ones who feel that they have been wronged. In April, a group of 30 Singaporean investors were reported to be suing British law firms Scott Fowler Solicitors and Graham & Rosen, alleging that the firms did not inform them about the risks of their investments. They are working with British law firm Lucas Law to recover about 8 million ($16 million) in losses. Two hundred investors, including the 30 Singaporeans, had invested with British developer Key Homes. The Singaporean investors had paid an average deposit of 40,000 for units in seven unfinished hotel and student hostel projects built by the now insolvent developer. The projects were in various cities, including London, Leicester and Birmingham. Several investors of Key Homes had turned to Zahid Alauddin, managing partner of Kingfields Solicitors, who specialises in real estate conveyance of UK properties. While he did not represent the investors in the Key Homes projects, nevertheless, he lent them his shoulder to cry on when they came to his office. Because Im not a litigator, I could only provide them with moral support and eventually they found a lawyer who is a litigator to help them, he says. According to a property adviser who declines to be named, one of the flaws of some of these investment schemes is that investors are asked to pay a huge deposit upfront, sometimes up to 80%. Deposits made by investors should be held in an escrow account until completion, adds the property adviser. But in some of these schemes, investors down payments are often released to the developer immediately instead of being held in the escrow account. More enforcement needed?In March last year, the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) had issued consumer tips on buying foreign properties, as well practice guidelines for estate agents and salespersons marketing overseas properties. Can CEA do more to help investors of foreign property investments that have turned sour? CEA does not have jurisdiction over foreign countries regulatory frameworks and practices governing foreign developers as well as the development and sale of foreign properties, says Heng Whoo Kiat, CEAs deputy director (licensing), in response to email queries. To help mitigate the risks in purchasing a foreign property, CEA would advise consumers to purchase foreign properties through a local estate agent. From 2013 to the present, CEA received a total of 14 complaints on the purchase of foreign properties, says Heng. This is in comparison with an average of 800 complaints received each year. The nature of complaints included developers going into liquidation, development not carried out according to schedule, and consumers being unable to get their deposits back from the developers after deciding to withdraw from the purchase. Over the same time period, the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) received 23 complaints regarding overseas property investments. Most of the complaints involved those who were unable to get back their promised returns or payouts. Under the Estate Agents Act, salespersons marketing foreign properties in Singapore are required to comply with the Act and its regulations, which includes performing due diligence on the foreign developer and the property, as provided for in CEAs Practice Guidelines. If an estate agent is found to have breached any of the provisions, CEA can take action against the agent. This could take the form of a financial penalty of up to $75,000. The estate agents licence or the salespersons registration could also be revoked or suspended. While due diligence by estate agents could help reduce risks to a limited extent, it would not ensure that the foreign property transaction would be risk-free, cautions CEA. Foreign developers could go into insolvency for various reasons, adds Heng. Scams by foreign developers, if any, may not be easy to detect. Scams, including property-related ones, are essentially cheating offences punishable under the Penal Code with imprisonment or a fine, or both, according to CEA. And cheating offences come under the purview of the police. Different investment schemesA number of failed investment schemes have surfaced over the past two years. Besides Key Homes, there was also EcoHouse, supposedly a Brazilian developer endorsed by the local government to build social housing. The scheme promised returns of 20% per annum, and 1,500 Singaporean investors sank a total of $70 million into the venture. An increasing number of people from the UK are trying to market creative schemes in Singapore, offering investments in parking spaces, hospital beds and even burial sites, observes a lawyer who declines to be named. One especially interesting non-property- related investment scheme that surfaced early this year was called Sure Win 4 U. It was a scheme by a Malaysian company to get investments to fund professional gamblers. The guaranteed returns and bonuses were to be funded by their casino winnings. About 150 people had lodged police reports after the companys representatives became uncontactable. The investors were reported to be a mix of locals and mainland Chinese who had invested a total of $50 million, with amounts ranging from $40,000 to $8 million. Why are more people falling for such investment schemes? Some are of the view that the property cooling measures in Singapore are partly to blame. Designed to protect investors from speculating in property, they have instead driven investors to look offshore. Nick, for one, had invested in several properties in Singapore over the years. However his investment appetite was curbed by the property cooling measures, he says. Last year, he not only invested in a hotel room at Ibis Lymm, but also purchased a unit in a student accommodation project in the UK. There is still a lot of liquidity in the market, says a property consultant. These are investors who have $100,000 to $200,000 sitting idle in the bank. As they cant buy a property in Singapore with that amount, they invest in such overseas schemes in the hope of higher returns. Shrinking property transaction volumes in the residential market and across all sectors have also spurred real estate agencies to look at marketing overseas properties in order to supplement their incomes. Encouraged by the successful sales in some of the earlier projects that had been launched in Singapore, even more UK developers of student accommodation, budget hotels and buy-to-let schemes are finding Asian markets, and especially Singapore, fertile ground to launch their projects. These developers dangle commissions of 9% to 12% to local agents in Singapore for properties sold, says a UK property adviser. Some of these local real estate agents could be enticed by such high commissions, he says. Putting money to workSo, how can investors avoid getting caught in risky investments? One lawyer says they should remember the old adage: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. What worries him is that the majority of the investors who fall prey to such schemes tend to be the mums and dads. He adds: They are not necessarily the high-net-worth investors, but they work very hard for their money, and its sitting in their account doing nothing. When they see 8% to 10% returns, they want to put their money to work. Theres nothing wrong with that. An investor who only wants to be known as Mr Wang bought two units at Ibis Lymm. He had heard about the investment from a friend who had purchased two rooms at Ibis Knutsford and then went on to buy a unit at Ibis Lymm as well. The $400,000 that Wang invested in the hotel rooms had been savings put aside for his retirement and his childrens university education. And we need the money, he sighs. Its been a burden. Another investor, Mr Fu, who bought two rooms at Ibis Lymm, agrees. A lot of us had sleepless nights, he admits. And so, we have been communicating with each other. The amount invested, $400,000, may not sound like a lot, but its not a small sum either. We have to answer to our families, Fu says. We thought we could get a brighter future, but it has turned out to be something opposite. Some investors have found solace in banding together. This was the case for some investors of Ibis Lymm. Its a bit like AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] or when you have cancer and you want to get together with other cancer patients, says Goh. Mr Koh believes he was most likely the last investor from Singapore to participate in the Ibis Lymm scheme. The whole experience has made him more vigilant, and since then, he has begun to scrutinise property advertisements, especially those offering high guaranteed returns. We have spent a lot of time trying to rescue our investments and to find out the truth, says Koh. I dont want other investors to go through what we did.

Demand from this demographic was higher in the primary market as evidenced by 60% of the transactions having buyers with HDB addresses, compared to just 43% in the resale market. The Edge Property sought to identify the most ideal towns for upgraders who wish to use their HDB rental proceeds to offset the monthly mortgage payments for their new condo. The study is based on data as at Sept 8, 2015 and does not account for future fluctuations in price and rent. Assuming the flat is fully paid for, HDB towns with the highest rents would ease the mortgage load of their upgraders the most. The exercise also assumes that upgraders aspire to stay within the same region. For example, upgraders in Hougang, Sengkang and Punggol might be looking for condos in the Northeast Region. In the East Region, Tampines flats commanded the highest rents of $2,350 per month for four-room flats and $2,500 for five-room flats in 2Q2015. Meanwhile, the median price for new condos and apartments in the region stood at $1,239 psf. Using the example of a 1,000 sq ft unit and an 80% loan with a 3.5% interest rate per annum for 30 years, the condo mortgage would amount to $4,451 per month. Four-room upgraders who rent out their flats would only need to fork out an additional $2,101 per month, and five-room upgraders another $1,951 per month if they use their HDB rent to offset their condo mortgage (see Table 1). Towns with higher HDB rents would give their prospective upgraders higher purchasing power. In the Northeast Region, for example, upgraders who own HDB flats would need to fork out less than $1,500 when they upgrade to condos in the same planning region. Queenstown and Bukit Merah topped the rental chart in the Central Region, Clementi and Jurong East in the West Region, Yishun and Sembawang in the North Region and Serangoon and Ang Mo Kio in the North East Region. Using HDB sales proceeds to finance acondo We then sought the towns where upgraders will need to fork out the lowest mortgage payment if they were to sell their HDB flats instead of renting them out. The exercise assumes the HDB flat is fully paid for and all the resale proceeds can be used to finance the new condo. For example, households who own a 4-room HDB flat in Tampines would need to top up $819,000 for a brand new condo unit in the East Region worth $1,239,000 after selling their existing flat for $420,000. This translates into a monthly mortgage payment of about $3,678 for a 30-year loan with 3.5% interest per annum. Bukit Merah and Bukit Timah topped the chart in the Central Region, Clementi and Bukit Batok in the West Region, Sembawang and Woodlands in the North Region, and Serangoon and Ang Mo Kio in the North East Region. Table 1 Source: HDB, URA, The Edge Property Table 2 Source: HDB, URA, The Edge Property Sell or rent? Upgraders who are wealthy enough that they do not need to finance their new home with the resale proceeds or rental income of the existing HDB flat will have the luxury of weighing the potential returns between selling and renting. Given that the gross rental yield for a resale HDB flat is relatively high at 5% to 7%, renting it out would likely be wiser from a financial standpoint. HDB rental income also serves as a hedge against potential loss in employment income. However, it must be noted that renting out an existing HDB unit carries regulatory risks. While the scenario is unlikely, the authorities could make HDB subletting illegal. Interested in upgrading to a condo in the North East region?

In fact, they have already been doing this all along.\"\"The government will continue to monitor the market and review our policies periodically,\" the MOF spokeswoman added.She acknowledged that MOF and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore had received appeals from developers for an extension to comply with the ABSD remission conditions, but declined to reveal how many such requests had been received or to give any other details, citing \"confidentiality of taxpayers' information\".Going by market talk, the period of extension requested by developers is one to two years.A market watcher suggested that the authorities may find it too early to start entertaining requests for the deadline extension given that there is still more than a year to go before the earliest deadline would be due.When the ABSD was first introduced effective Dec 8, 2011, the rate for purchases of residential property (including land) by companies was set at 10 per cent of the purchase price. From Jan 12, 2013, this rate was hiked to 15 per cent.The five-year deadline for completing the project on the residential site and selling all its units kicks off from the date of contract or agreement to buy the site - which for collective sales, is the date of the collective sale order granted under the Land Titles (Strata) Act.Property agents have been complaining that residential collective sales have been hit by the five-year deadline. For prime district sites, having to sell all the units within this timeframe poses a challenge, given the generally subdued buying sentiment for luxury properties, which had relied significantly on foreign buyers, who now have to pay 15 per cent on their residential property purchases. Singaporean investors too have to pay an ABSD, albeit at lower rates.Feedback from developers is that they have also found large en bloc sale sites such as former Housing & Urban Development Company (HUDC) estates risky.Each estate can potentially yield a thousand or more new units, which is at least double the size of a typical private housing site offered at state land sales.If developers cannot finish selling all the units in time, they will have to pay the ABSD with interest calculated at 5 per cent per annum starting from 14 days after the date of contract or agreement.Norman Ho, partner at Rodyk & Davidson, said that he advises clients against writing in to IRAS for an extension of the deadline.\"It is unlikely IRAS will give you an extension or waiver, because if they did, then all the other developers will also start asking for it. And when you got the upfront remission, you had given an undertaking to comply with the deadline.\"He also noted that the five-year period to finish selling all units in the new project may not be enough amid current market conditions.\"After a collective sale order has been granted, it takes another three months for the sale to be completed, after which sellers are usually allowed to stay on in their units for a further six months. So you have nine months eating into the five-year period. Things are even worse for big estates like ex-HUDC estates as there are more owners involved.\"Knight Frank chairman Tan Tiong Cheng highlighted that \"urban renewal by the private sector is also being inhibited by the difficulty in doing collective sales, in light of this deadline\".\"It may be hard for existing owners in older residential developments that are in deteriorating condition to sell their units individually as prices may be depressed. Refurbishing the building may require more funds from the owners but more fundamentally it could be only a temporary solution - if obsolescence has set in. The most natural exit would be an en bloc sale.\"Not only have some developers been seeking extensions from the authorities, but at least in one case, owners of an estate where an en bloc sale has been launched, are taking the initiative to boost their chance of a sale.Some owners of Shunfu Ville in Marymount Road recently signed and submitted a petition to MOF and IRAS requesting that the site's successful bidder be granted seven years, instead of five, to finish building the project on site and selling all the units.When contacted, JLL, the sole maketing agent for the collective sale, confirmed that the petition collected more than 200 signatures from owners.Among other things, the owners highlighted maintenance issues such as leakage and roofing in the development, which is more than 20 years old.The owners are also seeking a fair chance for a successful collective sale; beyond that, they argued that allowing developers more time to complete and sell off a residential project would help other former HUDC estates as well.In the first instance, the authorities encouraged privatisation of HUDC estates. In the past, this was greeted warmly by owners as they could attempt an en bloc sale post-privatisation.JLL, said, however, that the introduction of ABSD had produced an unintended deterrent to en bloc sales, which is the main option for rejuvenating old estates.Shunfu Ville's tender will close on Oct 27. Located a stone's throw from Marymount MRT Station on the Circle Line, the estate is on a site of about 409,000 square feet and zoned for residential with a gross plot ratio of 2.8 under Master Plan 2014. The site could potentially yield about 1,100-plus units with an average size of 1,000 sq ft.Currently on site are 358 units in three 16-storey apartment blocks and three low-rise blocks of six-storey maisonettes. Built in the late 1980s by the former HUDC, Shunfu Ville was privatised in 2013."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Today, CapitaLand and its predecessor companies have a combined experience of nearly 50 years. Prior to the merger, DBS Land had its origins in 1978 and became a leading property company in Singapore listed on the SGX main board with significant operations spanning 11 countries in the Asia Pacific and Europe. Pidemco Land, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore Technologies with its roots as the Urban Redevelopment Authority's property management arm, was established in 1989 and became one of the largest property groups in Singapore with significant investments in 24 cities in 12 countries. including key gateway cities in the Asia-Pacific region and the United Kingdom.\"Achievements\"We have a strong track record of leveraging our strength in Singapore to build significant regional and global businesses. An example would be Ascott, which is now the largest international serviced residence business with presence in Asia, Australia, Europe and US. Another example would be our shopping mall business, with 105 malls in Singapore, China, Malaysia, Japan and India.\"We have built a strong business foundation in China. CapitaLand was one of the first foreign-funded developers to enter China in 1994. We were among the first to introduce integrated developments to China, with the official opening of Raffles City Shanghai in 2004. Today, we have eight Raffles City developments in China, worth over S$12 billion when completed, as well as a sizeable residential business with more than 115,000 residential units including those under development.\"Our people are willing to embrace innovation and technology. In 2001, CapitaLand launched Singapore's first 'intelligent' building, Capital Tower. In 2015, recognising that technology will play a pivotal role in real estate of the future, we formed the CapitaLand Technology Council, the first by an Asian real estate developer, comprising technology stalwarts to provide strategic inputs. We work with technology partners such as Samsung and Tujia.com (China's equivalent of AirBnB) to define this new space.\"Another of our achievements is that we set up Singapore's first real estate investment trust (Reit), CapitaLand Mall Trust, in 2002 and pioneered a new capital efficient business model for real estate companies. Today, we have five listed Reits and 17 real estate private equity funds, with total assets under management of over S$44.1 billion. We continue to work with strong capital partners and target to set up six more funds with total AUM of over S$10 billion by 2020, including the recent 50:50 joint venture with the Qatar Investment Authority.\"We also strive to be a responsible member of the community. To encourage volunteerism, we put in place a three-day Volunteer Service Leave (VSL) for our staff in 2006, the first Singapore company to do so. We are pleased to see a ten-fold increase in staff volunteer hours - from over 2,500 hours in 2010 to more than 28,000 in 2014.\"Most challenging moment\"The market was sceptical of our strategy to expand overseas post-merger. When I was sent to Shanghai in 2000 to set up and lead CapitaLand's China operations, people were unfamiliar with us. It was very challenging at first, but we worked hard to build trust and confidence in the company. Today, we are well-recognised as one of the largest foreign-funded real estate developers in China, with S$20.7 billion of investments in China (as at June 30).PONTIAC LAND GROUP Interview with Kwee Liong Keng, managing directorAbout the companyIt was founded in 1961.Achievements\"One of the projects we are most proud of is Regent Singapore, which was launched in 1982. This was American architect John Portman's first project outside the US and in Singapore. His vision was to bring Singapore's tropical environment indoors by landscaping the atrium space. The lobby also has beautifully designed elevators that act as kinetic sculptures and a cascading Rainshower art piece created by celebrated artist Michio Ihara.\"We also built two office towers - Millenia Tower and Centennial Tower - as part of our Millenia Singapore development in the Marina Centre locale. Both skyscrapers were designed by Pritzker Prize laureate Kevin Roche. Millenia Tower, the tallest building in Marina Centre, has a unique and prominent architecture that is easily recognised as part of the Singapore skyline. We also built The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore; we were the first to place windows in our bathrooms, and this has since become an iconic feature of the hotel. Along with a stellar collection of 4,200 art pieces, our hotel has become a benchmark of innovation, art and design for all the Ritz-Carltons of the world.\"Seeking to create enduring designs for long-terms investments, Pontiac Land Group pioneered the trend of luxury residences designed by internationally renowned architects. To date, we have worked with Paul Rudolph for The Colonnade (1986), Ben van Berkel for Ardmore Residence (2013) and Kerry Hill for HANA (2015).\"The group has also expanded into New York City and Sydney. In 2013, Pontiac Land Group invested in 53W53, the iconic residential condominium development that will also house the expansion of New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The 82-storey residential tower is under construction.\"In September 2015, Pontiac Land Group was awarded the opportunity to redevelop two iconic heritage buildings in the heart of Sydney. We shall redevelop the two stunning conservation Sandstone buildings into a 240-room hotel, which will be one of the best luxury hotels in the world.\"At Pontiac Land Group, we hold a long-term view of our assets with an aim to combine creativity with business. We see this as a collaborative process and we work things through a clear, constructive manner that delivers the best outcome for tenants, our guests and us - without compromising the architect's and creative team's vision.\"UOL GROUP Interview with Gwee Lian Kheng, chief executiveAbout the company\"UOL was founded in 1963 under the name Faber Union. It was renamed United Overseas Land in 1975 and subsequently to UOL Group in 2006. Today, UOL has a diversified business model in residential development, hospitality and property investments.\"Achievements\"UOL is an integral part of the Singapore story and is closely associated with the city-state's changing skyline over the past 50 years. We started small but our entrepreneurial spirit quickly led us to be a forerunner in building quality private residential developments with early projects such as Faber Gardens, Mount Echo Park and Orchard Bel Air and more recently, award-winning projects like Nassim Park Residences and Newton Suites.\"We also had humble beginnings in hospitality with the 260-room Hotel Merlin along Beach Road in the early 1970s. We bought more hotels and hotel brands as we became more profitable with better cash flow. Between 1993 and 2005, we purchased several hotels in Australia, Vietnam, Malaysia, China and Myanmar. Today, we own and manage more than 30 properties globally through our wholly- owned subsidiary Pan Pacific Hotels Group Limited (PPHG).\"The group has made some significant acquisitions. In 2009 during the global financial crisis, UOL increased its strategic stake in United Industrial Corporation (UIC), making it an associated company of the group. Over the years, UOL has gradually added its interest in UIC to 44 per cent. In turn, UIC holds more than 99 per cent of Singapore Land (SingLand), which was privatised in 2014. The increased shareholding in UIC enlarges the group's exposure to UIC and SingLand's quality commercial assets in the Singapore CBD.\"In 2013, UOL decided to delist PPHG so as to allow greater management flexibility to review the running cost of the subsidiary and seize new opportunities.\"Good design is very much part of UOL's DNA. UOL is behind several Singapore landmarks including Parkroyal on Pickering and Pan Pacific Serviced Suites on Beach Road which garnered the prestigious FIABCI World Prix d'Excellence awards. To date, we have received more than 10 local and international FIABCI awards for both our hospitality and residential projects on top of other highly acclaimed awards like the President's Design Award and the Aga Khan Award.\"Most challenging moment\"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003 was one of the most challenging periods for UOL. Tourist arrivals declined and occupancy rates at our hotels fell. Our malls in the Novena area were deserted and business plunged as people were afraid to be in the vicinity of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the treatment centre for Sars.\"We took some decisive steps to mitigate the impact of Sars. A cost containment plan was introduced. With the union's cooperation, our staff at three Singapore hotels took no-pay leave over a period of four months. We also cut back on hiring and took advantage of the lull period to intensify staff training.\"To restore confidence in our malls, our maintenance team stepped up frequent cleaning of common areas like lifts and installed hand sanitisers at entrances. We gave rental reductions to some of our tenants to cushion the drop in business. Such steps helped us ride out that very difficult period.\"WING TAI HOLDINGS Interview with Edmund Cheng, deputy chairmanAbout the company\"The company was incorporated in Singapore on Aug 9, 1963; it was founded in Hong Kong in 1955.\"Over the past 50 years, we have made several successful turnings in our growth and expansion - from manufacturing to property, and diversifying into related sectors of retail and hospitality. Today, we are a pan-Asian enterprise and our projects are sought after globally by a discerning clientele.\"Achievements\"We were among the first to embrace art and heritage in our architecture. We lead by our conservation practices, always seeking to keep the history and heritage of a place. By the timelessness of our architecture, creating and preserving value, we appeal to customers beyond geographies and generations. This can be seen in The Crest, our latest development designed by Toyo Ito; it is an experience of urban stature, privacy and fine domestic detail.\"We have always been enterprising, adaptive and responsive to change. Our business philosophy of fair dealing and achieving winning partnerships stems from our foundational core values of trust, respect and mutual benefit. We believe in always leaving something on the table for our partners and customers.\"Most challenging moments\"The external changes and challenges, they come and go fast. But we need to be steadfast in upholding our core values, balancing prudence and profit in our growth and expansion. Such an approach guides many aspects of our business, and enables us to earn the trust of our staff, customers, partners and shareholders. It is this earned trust that enables us to overcome the challenges we face in times of crisis.\"FAR EAST ORGANIZATION Interview with Augustine Tan, executive director, property sales and corporate affairsAbout the company\"Far East Organization was founded by the late Ng Teng Fong in 1960. Its early milestones were built on the aspirations of our founder's entrepreneurial vision coupled with his propensity for hard work and frugality . . . Mr Ng broke tradition and forged his own path beyond his family's soya sauce and grocery shop business to establish a real estate development company.\"Achievements\"By the grace of God, Far East Organization has been able to play a role in the many historical markers of Singapore's progress - including the shaping of Orchard Road and Singapore's urban landscape, as well as the many innovative home concepts that have met homebuyers' aspirations. These include Far East SOHO (apartments that offer flexible space in strategic locales with excellent connectivity) and Inessence (ultra-luxury homes customised for savvy homebuyers) in addition to vibrant mixed-use developments.\"As a Christian enterprise, Far East Organization is guided by its values to seek the welfare of the city, support the causes of the needy and show love to its neighbours. Through space philanthropy facilitated by the government's Community/Sports Facilities Scheme, the group has gifted five purpose-built spaces at its developments for community use.\"Most challenging moments\"In recent memory, the Asian Financial Crisis was a very difficult period for developers. Events happened in a short span of time; interest rates spiked up quickly and the market fell sharply. What followed were very bad years for the Singapore property market, from the troughs of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997/1998 to 2001, when there was a double dip caused by the terrorist attacks which precipitated the Wall Street crash and the worldwide turmoil, through the sluggish market to 2006/2007.\"Through this period, we consolidated our operations by doing more with less. We remain steadfast in making improvements operationally, structurally and organisationally so that we can do business better and create more value from our resources. Our goal is to build an enduring enterprise that contributes to fulfilment for our customers, our business partners and our people. Far East Organization is committed to investing in the creation of innovative, functional spaces that will improve and inspire better lives.\"HONG LEONG GROUP/ CITY DEVELOPMENTS Interview with Kwek Leng Beng, executive chairmanAbout the companyHong Leong Group was established in 1941 by Kwek Hong Png. Since the 1980s, the company has been under the leadership of the second generation of the Kwek family with Kwek Leng Beng at the helm as executive chairman. The group is currently focused in four core businesses - real estate, hotels, financial services, and trade and industry.The group ventured into property development in the 1960s with Hong Leong Holdings, a private property holding company which was set up in 1968. In 1972, Hong Leong acquired a controlling stake in City Developments Limited (CDL), which was formed in 1963.Achievements\"We have put Singapore on the map by building a global hotel business. From just one hotel in the 1970s, the group's hospitality business has grown to include more than 170 hotels (including properties in the pipeline) in over 20 countries with over 45,000 rooms globally. In 1996, we floated our hotel arm, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels (M&C), on the London Stock Exchange.\"The group stamped its financial and hospitality leadership with the formation of Singapore's first hotel real estate investment trust, CDL Hospitality Trusts.\"On the Singapore residential property front, the group has developed many iconic properties over a span of more than five decades, reinforcing its position as a market leader with quality properties such as One Shenton and The Residences at W Singapore - Sentosa Cove. Hong Leong Group was also the first developer to launch a branded residences project here - St Regis Hotel & Residences. Member companies in the group have developed close to 50,000 homes catering to a wide range of market segments here and in the region.\"CDL has been an early advocate of environmental sustainability and measures its success with a triple bottom line focus on People, Planet and Profit. CDL has developed City Square Mall along Kitchener Road as Singapore's first eco-mall and 11 Tampines Concourse as the first CarbonNeutral development in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific.\"We have also contributed to the push to make Singapore a global city by revitalising old districts across Singapore - the latest example being the South Beach mixed-use project. The group has created several other iconic developments across the city. The 66-storey Republic Plaza was the first project here to win the FIABCI Prix d'Excellence Overall winner award in 1997, while The Sail @ Marina Bay was one of the world's tallest residences at the time of its completion in 2008.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Cooperation between the government and business leaders was crucial in clinching the deal with India last week, he said.Japan, which built the world's first high-speed train more than half a century ago, is stepping up efforts to export its bullet-train technology to meet a pledge by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to triple infrastructure exports to 30 trillion yen (S$349.7 billion) by 2020. Singapore and Malaysia have proposed a rail line connecting Singapore and Kuala Lumpur that will cut the travel time for the 300km journey to 90 minutes from at least four hours by road.Malaysia and Singapore received close to 250 submissions after calling for a request for information for the project, and 98 were shortlisted, the New Straits Times reported on Tuesday. Fourteen foreign entities among the 98 were asked to present their views, including France's Alstom SA, Germany's Siemens AG, Spain's CAF and Talgo SA, Canada's Bombardier Inc., a group led by China Railway, as well as consortiums from Japan and South Korea, the paper reported, without saying where it had obtained the names.China is the main supplier of rolling stock in Malaysia, with 80 per cent of the market, said Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar, chairman of Malaysia's Land Public Transport Commission, according to the newspaper. China has expressed \"keen interest\" in the Singapore- Kuala Lumpur project, but it all boils down \"to competition\", he was quoted as saying.Japan beat China for India's first high-speed rail contract. The South Asian country picked Japan to help build a 505km railway connecting India's financial capital of Mumbai with Ahmedabad, a major economic and industrial hub in Gujarat state, according to an announcement by the two nations on Saturday.Hitachi makes bullet trains.

That view and the house itself is still protected, although the rest of the estate is up for grabs. This is because the UK government has carved up two plots (Plots A and B) on the eastern side of Eden Hall for sale by public tender. The sites have a combined land area of 34,254 sq ft, and amounts to 35% of the existing grounds of 97,889 sq ft. Plot A has a site area of 18,620 sq ft, and a 36 m frontage along Nassim Road. It includes a huge part of the garden along the driveway and an open air parking space for about six cars. The other land parcel, Plot B, has a long narrow driveway leading up to an elevated rectangular site adjacent to the house. Plot B has a total area of 15,634 sq ft. Both sites are zoned for residential use under the Good Class Bungalow (GCB) area of Nassim Road, the most prestigious address in Singapore. Given its wider frontage along Nassim Road, Plot A has a price tag of $2,200 psf, with the absolute price amounting to $40.96 million. Plot B is priced lower at $2,000 psf, owing to its long driveway, which translates to an absolute price of $31.27 million. CBRE is the sole marketing agent for both plots. The front lawn of Eden Hall will be retained by the British government Why sell now? The sale of Plots A and B will mean not just the loss of the eastern part of the garden but the swimming pool too. In return, the British High Commissioner will gain two new neighbours among Singapores seriously rich. The UK government has a responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure that its owned estate is of the right size necessary to undertake the functions associated with the estate, according to a statement by the British governments Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO). The sale was undertaken as part of a regular review by FCO of its overseas estate in order to achieve better value and efficiency, it said. In this instance the garden at Eden Hall is larger than is necessary to accommodate the official functions of the HC Residence. Following the sale of these two garden plots, the total land area will be reduced to 63,893 sq ft, which is the minimum size required to maintain the value of Eden Hall, while allowing the normal residence functions to continue, adds the FCO. The British high commissioners residence will continue at Eden Hall, which is a 14,000 sq ft double storey house. It has three reception rooms on the first level, and another reception room on the second level with a wraparound verandah. There are also six bedrooms on the second level. Steeped in history The house at Eden Hall has a rich history. Designed by renowned architect R.A.J. Bidwell of Singapores oldest and most prominent architectural firm Swan & McLaren, it was built in 1904. The owner was Jewish merchant Ezekiel Saleh Manasseh, a trader in rice and opium, as well as a co-owner of Goodwood Park Hotel between 1918 and 1945. Bidwell was also the architect of Goodwood Park Hotel, Raffles Hotel and the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall. The house was initially leased to Elizabeth Campbell, who operated a boarding house, Manasseh purchased the 4.75 acre land which the property sat on from his business partner for $30,000 in 1912. He moved into Eden House four years later with his family, and they lived there until 1942 when Singapore fell to the Japanese. Manasseh was sent to Changi Prison, where he later died in the prison hospital at Sime Road. His stepson, Vivian Bath, was sent to a labour camp on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. During the Japanese Occupation, Eden Hall was used by the Japanese as an officers mess. It was requisitioned for the use by the British forces after the occupation. And when Bath returned to Singapore, he regained possession of Eden Hall When Bath decided to retire in Australia, he sold Eden Hall to the British Government in 1957 for a nominal sum of 56,000, with the stipulation that a plaque be installed at the bottom of the flagpole, which reads, May the Union Jack fly here forever. The neighbours Prior to 2002, the house sat on a sprawling 207,000 sq ft of freehold land, with tennis courts, stables and a swimming pool. The tennis courts and stables disappeared 13 years ago when the FCO sold half the land on the western side of Eden Hall to two prominent businessmen, namely Sam Goi of Tee Yih Jia Foods aka The Popoah King who has since ventured into property development investment, and Peter Kwee of Group Exklusiv, a renowned European car distributor, owner of Laguna Golf & Country Club, as well as a string of properties and hotels. The duo reportedly paid $50.4 million for the site, and subsequently split up the site between them. Kwee took the larger plot of 63,300 sq ft, which he then carved up into two plots. One plot of 39,383 sq ft was sold to Indonesian businesswoman Sukmawati Widjaja or Oei Siu Hua, the executive chairman of Singapore listed company Top Global. She paid $25.5 million ($647 psf) for the site back in 2003. Sukmawati has made the house at Nassim Road her primary residence and is living there with her family. Kwee sold the second plot of 23,920 sq ft to Tay Liam Wee, the former chairman and managing director of Sincere Watch. The selling price was said to be $47.8 million or $2,000 psf in 2012, in a deal brokered by KH Tan of Newsman Realty. Goi has since built his home on the Nassim Road plot. The triangular plot fronting Nassim Road is still vacant. Word on the street is that Tay had appointed a Japanese architect to design the GCB, but the property has yet to be built. Given the shape of plots A and B, which the UK government has offered for sale by public tender, Newsmans Tan believes that the asking prices are in line with market values. According to Sammi Lim, associate director of investment properties at CBRE, Its a fair guide price in the current market and pegged to the previous price, she adds. Prices coming off Traditionally, people prefer a site with a wider frontage and therefore the price psf of Plot A is higher at $2,200 psf, acknowledges Sammi Lim, associate director of investment properties at CBRE. However, the fact that Plot B is on an elevated site, and has a long driveway means that it is more exclusive. Lim sees expressions of interest for the separate plots, as well as parties interested in the combined sites. She sees the two plots attracting interest of those seeking an empty plot so they can design and build their own home. At the peak of the market in April 2013, Cheng Wai Keung, the executive chairman of Wing Tai Holdings had launched for sale a two-storey home sitting on an 85,000 sq ft elevated plot at 33 Nassim Road. The asking price for the property was $300 million or $3,529 psf. Had it been sold at that price, it would have shattered all records, both in terms of absolute and price psf. Over the past year, GCB transactions have come off, and so have average prices. Data from CBRE Research showed that in 2014, there were 28 GCB transactions totalling $626.14 million. Average transacted price was $22.36 million or $1,428 psf in 2014. For 2015, there have only been 18 GCB transactions which is the lowest level seen since 1996, according to CBRE Research. Total transaction value for the year to date rang in at $500.78 million. While the average price per GCB was higher at $27.82 million relative to 2014s $22.36 million, on a price psf basis, it was 18.8% lower at $1,159 psf. For many interested parties looking at the two parcels offered for sale by the UK government, the main attraction is the house address, No. 28, according to a property agent who declined to be named. Being able to call the British High Commissioner ones neighbour may lend a certain measure of prestige and bragging rights. It is definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to stay in a GCB next to the British High Commissioners home, says CBREs Lim. However, there is no assurance that one will get invited over for tea. Interested in apartments / condos near Eden Hall?

The trio were deceived into believing that the amount payable by Manor Construction was 20 per cent of the \"option to purchase'' for a property at Yung Ho Road.He also deceived them into believing that he had preferential shares in Advance Modules Group, which would rise to 50 cents a share, thus inducing them to give him $240,000 in October the same year.A district court heard that the the trio came to know Wong through a business deal in 2007. During their introductions, Wong responded affirmatively when asked if he was related to or was then-DPM Wong's brother.Sometime in September 2007, Wong told them that he knew the director of the company that had the lease of a plot of land at Yung Ho Road. He invited them to invest in the project, through Manor, for him to build a commercial building on it.After the trio had given Wong $180,000, being 20 per cent of the \"option to purchase'' the land worth $900,000, Wong encashed the cheque.Despite repeated requests, he failed to deliver the documents pertaining to the payment.In April 2008, he told them that the investment was unsuccessful and promised to return the $180,000.Wong also cheated the trio of $240,000 for preferential shares in a listed company called Advance Modules. He had claimed that he was arranging for a deal with the company and that the shares would rise to 50 cents a share from the market price of 15 cents.He later told the trio that he could not secure the purchase of the shares and promised to return the $240,000.The court heard that he neither had the ability to secure any preferential shares nor have any such shares.Wong has made partial restitution of about $200,000.Deputy Public Prosecutor Hon Yi will present his submissions on sentence while defence counsel Edmond Pereira will mitigate on Wong's behalf on April 26.elena@sph.com.sgJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Recently, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reinforced this global focus with sustainable city life as one of the 17 global goals for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Smart cities are those that have incorporated (or are incorporating) technology solutions to make infrastructure and government more efficient, improving environmental performance and adaptability and reducing full life-cycle cost for infrastructure. Delivering successful urban and smart environments requires planning for climate adaptation, strategies to protect assets and cyber security, as well as frameworks for sustainable economic development.AECOM recently conducted research on 40 of these cities around the world that are involved with expanding smart initiatives to find out their priorities. Energy, transportation and governance were identified as the top three issues. With building and structures being one of the top consumers of energy in cities, multiple-pronged approaches need to be implemented to reduce consumption.These results are in line with Singapore's plans where Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has made sustainable development a priority under the six core pillars of the Smart Nation Programme (2014) to transform Singapore into a city \"where people live meaningful and fulfilled lives, enabled seamlessly by technology, offering exciting opportunities for all\". Critical to this programme is the design and implementation of a fully integrated information and communications technology (ICT) ecosystem with innovative solutions to transform Singapore into the world's first \"smart nation\".A major part of this transformation will include Singapore's real estate environment. Existing and future buildings and structures need to become smarter, work more efficiently and be more adaptable to users. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Ministry of National Development have been championing many key initiatives to create better and smarter buildings and infrastructure but there is still room to advance.A smarter built environment that uses technological solutions to provide intelligent control and management systems for energy, water, waste and security (physical and cyber) is starting to emerge. Such solutions are usually automated and this makes the buildings more resource efficient. There are intangible benefits such as health, employee productivity, corporate social responsibility, educational excellence and there is also evidence that smarter performing buildings are translating into higher property values. However, the market is only beginning to consider operating or life-cycle costs in pricing models.KEY TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDSBuilding Information Modelling (BIM) is described as a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility. It provides critical information during the planning and design phase of the project, increasing overall productivity of the project. Post-construction, these BIM information systems are becoming the smart hubs for building monitoring and management systems that are connected to highly sophisticated smart technologies and sensor network that integrate, manage and analyse data collected from across the building. At the same time, this data is becoming more accessible to end users who can understand consumption patterns.The number of green-certified buildings and gross floor area is getting larger in Singapore but is still small compared to the amount of current building stock with higher consumption patterns. Introduction of building management systems can drive energy efficiency and it is estimated that energy consumption for buildings can be reduced by 10 to 20 per cent with simple operational changes that require little to no capital investments or upgrades.This can be done through retrofits of inefficient equipment with new energy management systems which provide key information about a building's consumption, streaming real-time data to a centralised platform for managers to see when and where the building is consuming energy.BUSINESS OF SMART CITY SOLUTIONSAs these trends continue to evolve there will be business opportunities for Singapore in the delivery of smart solutions.The World Green Building Trends 2016: Developing Markets Accelerate Global Green Growth report indicates that the growth of green building activity in Singapore is expected to remain robust from 2015 through 2018. The report identified four green building sectors where Singapore is positioned to be a global leader:Given the amount of new regulations, policies and incentives relating to green buildings, it is striking that these numbers are so low. However, as buildings and structures become smarter and more sustainable, this will provide a platform of growth for Singapore businesses and also as a global exporter especially for cities in tropical climates.SMARTER COMMUNITIESSmart technologies can be applied at many levels: the individual, the home, the building, the estate, the neighbourhood, the district, and the city as a whole. There are many opportunities at a community level for smarter interfaces and to create the next evolution of building projects. Companies that will be successful in this market are those whose buildings are not only smart in function, but are also smart in connecting and integrating with the urban fabric.This means creating easy and efficient multiple mobility modes connecting the last kilometre of any journey, opening up opportunities for changing industrial spaces which have better alignment with residential, retail and commercial land use, and connecting private and public housing with facilities such as community centres, schools, family clinics, parks and more.Bedok Transit Oriented Development is a good example that blends many of these elements together including the new Bedok Integrated Transport Hub servicing bus and MRT, retail and commercial space and residential development. This facility achieved the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) Green Mark Platinum Award and features energy efficient lighting for the concourse, LED lighting for the driveway and bus park area, as well as a water-cooled air-conditioning system.With Singapore going down the decentralised city centre route that entails moving the population and employment to Jurong Lake District and Woodlands, buildings that have greater connectivity are the ones that will be able to capture the people and increase footfall, resulting in enhanced property value as a whole.SMART CITIZENSUltimately, a significant part of the smart city and smarter buildings movement involves educating people about their behaviour, how they affect usage and costs of limited resources, and potential ways to adjust. It will be the citizens who will create, enhance and maintain a smart building stock that add to the vibrancy of a tropical city and make Singapore brilliant."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The fever took hold as investors piled into the non-residential property sector after many rounds of government cooling measures imposed on the residential market.Some of the changes in policies during this period include an increase in the seller's stamp duty (SSD) in January 2011 and the introduction of additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) in December 2011.Yet, the good times did not last long. The cooling Chinese economy coupled with the nearly muted year-end manufacturing activity at home are weighing on the Singapore industrial property market, prompting both industrialists and investors to tweak their competitive strategies.Against such a backdrop of slower growth and weaker sentiment, many have debated the issue of whether to invest in 30-year, 60-year leasehold or freehold industrial properties.Among industrial properties with different remaining tenures, 30-year leaseholds have been hit the hardest. The price index of sites with 30-year leases and below started to fall in Q2 2015, dropping from 108.2 in Q1 2015 to 105.6 in Q2 2015. This translates into a 2.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter contraction.Since then, the price has slipped continuously. Up to Q4 2015, the cumulative drop was at an all-time high of 9.9 per cent. This is the highest level of total contraction recorded since the time series started in Q1 2010.The situation was slightly better for industrial properties whose remaining tenure is between 31 and 60 years. Although the price index also suffered quarters of consecutive decline, the rate of contraction was relatively mild. As at Q4 2015, the cumulative decrease of the price index was only 2.2 per cent.Meanwhile, leasehold industrial properties with 60-year leases and above fared the best. The price index held up its momentum despite market uncertainties and low investor sentiment. Even though the index dropped slightly in Q4 2015 by 1.1 per cent quarter on quarter, this was after having gained 3.1 per cent over the past three quarters.Yields of 30-year leasehold properties outperformedData based on industrial properties that are marketed by SLP Business Space reflects the clear division in terms of yields among properties with different remaining tenures.The minimum rental yield is calculated by taking the minimum monthly rent divided by the maximum price that investors have to pay to acquire the property. Similarly, the maximum rental yield is equal to the maximum monthly rent divided by the minimum asking price.At first glance, 30-year leasehold industrial space appears to beat their 60-year leasehold and freehold counterparts hands down. Both new and old 30-year leasehold properties yield much higher rental returns, fluctuating between 4.15 per cent and 9.77 per cent for newer space and between 4.39 per cent and 9.38 per cent for relatively more mature estates. This is partly caused by the discounted price of such properties compared to similar freehold space.Therefore, the empirical evidence seems to support the hypothesis that 30-year leasehold industrial space is a much better bargain than freeholds or 60-year leaseholds.However, it should be noted that for every investment, there are two aspects of returns, namely the return of capital and the return on capital. Return on capital is the amount of income generated from the initial investment. This indicates how efficiently the capital is being utilised. Hence, from this perspective, a 30-year leasehold does indeed outperform its counterparts.The return of capital is the time it takes for an investor to recoup the original financial outlay over the life of the project. Since a leasehold property has a limited lifespan, it is theoretically expected that the return of capital for a leasehold site should be greater than that of a comparable freehold estate.The premium return for a leasehold, which refers to the excess yield of a leasehold over that of a freehold, is to compensate for the decaying nature of these properties.Nevertheless, given the market turmoil and declining investor confidence, it is understandable why many investors are jumping on the shorter leasehold bandwagon. After all, such properties promise higher immediate returns, which are preferred to the delayed future returns and inherent uncertainties associated with longer leaseholds amid current market conditions.Why invest in longer leasehold industrial space?It is noted that many people are still attracted to longer leasehold industrial properties despite the relatively lower returns. The reasons revolve around concepts of ownership and inheritability. For freehold properties, investors may view it not as an investment opportunity but an asset to be passed down to the next generation.That being the case, this group of investors are less sensitive to the market conditions or the current offering returns and hence, more willing to forgo the aforementioned yield premiums in return for longevity and ownership.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, the argument over which industrial properties are superior should not focus only on the nature of remaining tenures.Each type of leasehold has its own advantages and drawbacks as presented.Instead, investors should focus on what they are looking for from the investment - be it immediate cash flow, stable income or ownership.At the same time, it is equally important to keep in mind the impact of other factors that can also play a significant role in influencing the rate of return.These include potential changes in government policies, land zonings, opening of new MRT stations and other non-tenure factors."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Checks on these private companies traced their ultimate shareholders to Ng Bok Eng Holdings, the family company of the late business mogul and philanthropist Ng Bok Eng and his family members.The late Mr Ng, dubbed the \"King of Cloves\" for his import-export business under Bian Bee Company, started Ng Bok Eng Holdings in 1969 to specialise in property and securities.Oxley Thanksgiving Residence, a single-strata development, is master-leased to The Pent Pte Ltd. The latter in turn sublets the units to tenants through Atas Residence. The Pent's major shareholder is Hoy San Holdings, the main business of which is in stevedoring, terminal operations, transportation and warehousing.Chinese temple Poh Ern Shih is said to have obtained the land in 1953 as a donation from temple founder Lee Choon Seng, who was acting chairman of OCBC during the Japanese occupation and later chairman during the 1960s.Some market watchers said the running of an entire residential development as serviced apartments was a grey area, in view of URA's guideline on minimum six-month stay in private residential properties to safeguard the living environment, safety and privacy of residents in the development.A development which is run like a hotel or serviced residence has no Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) by-law, as the owner or the master lessee is the defacto managing body, and there are no long-term \"residents\" to take into consideration, said Century 21 Singapore chief executive Ku Swee Yong.He expressed sympathy for the home-owners in other residential developments in the vicinity, who, aside from concerns over safety and security, may have to deal with deteriorating property values from being near a development with transient tenants.He said: \"During weak markets, when vacancies are high - especially coupled with low seasons for tourist arrivals - rental values will fall significantly. This will attract a different class of short-term tenants to the condominium.\"Investors who are in the market for short-term gains are also less likely to uphold high standards in the maintenance of the units. These factors are likely to depress property values within and around the condominium block in question.\"Toh Kok Seng, senior partner at law firm Lee & Lee, said developments that do not have approval from URA to be run as serviced apartments are breaching The Planning Act if they do so.Currently, the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, the legislation governing strata title properties in Singapore, does not have specific by-laws against short-term leases. The MCSTs of some condominiums, however, have passed specific by-laws to prohibit short-term stays.Even in the case when a master tenancy is issued, property owners are still liable for breaches of law in the sub-tenancies if they are aware of the breach, but turn a blind eye to it, Mr Toh said.READ MORE:"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

February was also a lull month with Chinese New Year festivities, hence the low base for comparison.Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Realty Network, said: \"Also, with weaker economic conditions, expatriates might be sent to Singapore on a project basis, which results in shorter leases signed. Hence, although the rental volume indicates a more active leasing market, much of it is due to a reshuffling of tenants.\"Rentals for private condominiums and apartments fell one per cent in March compared with February, according to estimates released by SRX Property on Wednesday. Rental volume rose 35.5 per cent, however. About 4,331 units were rented in March, compared with 3,197 units in February. The rental volume was also 9.3 per cent higher than the 3,961 units rented in March 2015.By region, the city centre, city fringe and suburbs saw drops in rents of 0.8 per cent, 1.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.Year on year, private rents last month were down by 5.3 per cent from March 2015. They were also down 15.9 per cent from their peak in January 2013.Reasons for the rental price downtrend include increased private home completions, which intensify competition among landlords for tenants, as well as stricter foreign labour regulations.RST Research director Ong Kah Seng said it is a tenants' market now: \"Two-year leases have fallen out of favour since 2015; the current standard is a one-year lease. Foreign professionals who have uncertainty in their placements in Singapore, or may be activated to relocate anytime to help their headquarters make inroads in emerging Asian markets would also prefer shorter leases.\" He expects private residential rents to fall by about 5 per cent in 2016, level with the 5.5 per cent rental fall in 2015.On the public housing front, HDB rents dipped 0.1 per cent in March, while HDB rental volume rose 44.3 per cent to about 2,214 flats, from 1,534 in February. Year on year, rental volume in March was also up 3 per cent.Three-room, four-room and executive flats posted 0.8 per cent, one per cent and 0.1 per cent declines in rentals respectively. Rents of five-room flats bucked the trend by rising 1.5 per cent.Year on year, rents in March 2016 were down 3.9 per cent from March 2015. They were also down 9.1 per cent compared to its peak in August 2013.Mr Ong expects HDB rents to fall by up to 5 per cent in 2016, on a par with 2015's 4 per cent rental fall, as more flat owners move into completed condominiums and put their flats up for subletting.Mr Lim expects there to be 22,000 to 24,000 HDB units leased in 2016, similar to those a year ago."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The primary target? Singaporeans. Owing to the series of property cooling measures in both Singapore and the UK, launches of London projects have lost some of their lustre. In 2009, there were 30 exhibitions with sales of 100 million. By 2011, there were 80 exhibitions with total sales of 450 million. At the height of the market in 2012, there were 100 UK property exhibitions in town, with sales of 650 million. By 2014, the number of exhibitions had slowed to 70, and last year, it whittled down to 50, according to data compiled by CBRE. The projection is that the figure could be even lower this year. In good times, developers budgets for overseas project launches are typically in the seven-figure range. In 2012, I was involved in the marketing of a London project across five cities in Asia, including Singapore, says a veteran in overseas property marketing. The developer spent about 1 million. An overseas property launch with all the bells and whistles five-star hotel venue with wine and canapes; smartly suited representatives from the developer flown in for the occasion; marketing materials, including advertisements can amount to $200,000 for just one weekend. Some niche players who have focused on marketing London projects to overseas buyers in Asia have since repositioned themselves as property developers and are offering Singapore investors co-investment opportunities. Thinking out of the boxThe off-plan sales exhibitions have taken a hit, says London-based Naoufal Dhimi, co-founder and director of Saffron Homes, who was in Singapore last week. So, we have to think out of the box and [come up with] ways to move the business forward. Our investors and clients always tell us that deep down, they want to be developers. And, it can be a success ful strategy. Another co-founder of Saffron Homes is Monty Nawaz, who set up Saffron International as a London broker with an office in Singapore in 2005. Saffron was established in London in 1997 and specialises in lettings and identifying resale or undervalued investment opportunities in London for overseas clients. Saffron Homes was launched as a property investment and development arm with opportunities exclusively for investors in Asia, says Nawaz. We look out for undervalued or overlooked projects, and structure tax- efficient investment schemes for Asian investors to co-invest in. A third co-founder is Singaporean architect Patrick Ng, who has practised in London for the past 15 years, previously with award-winning London architectural firms Tate Hindle and Sheppard Robson. Niche developer Saffron Homes founders (from left): Ng, Dhimi and Nawaz Club dealsSome of the projects in London offered by Saffron Homes to Singaporean investors are in the form of club deals, with a minimum entry of 200,000 ($384,908). One example is a 10,000 sq ft commercial site at Leyton High Road, currently an investment hotspot in the London borough of Waltham Forest. The site was secured by Saffron for 1.6 million; it can be torn down and redeveloped into a residential scheme. In February, the group obtained planning permission for the development of a three storey building with retail space on the first level and nine apartments on the upper levels. Construction is expected to cost 1.2 million. Upon completion, the total gross development value of the project is estimated to be 4 million. Saffron is not new to the area. In June 2014, it acquired the Oliver Twist Pub, which already had planning permission to renovate internally and add another floor for conversion into nine apartments. The acquisition price was 900,000, and another 650,0000 was spent on renovations. Saffron gutted the property and rebuilt it as planned. By February 2015, all nine apartments were sold, for a total of 2.7 million. Another example of redevelopment with change-of-use opportunity is a 10,000 sq ft freehold site on Coopers Lane. Currently, there is a vacant metal pipe workshop on the site, but planning approval has been secured for it to be redeveloped into a gated residence with six townhouses, Ng says. In the prestigious Knightsbridge area, Saffron Homes recently completed the acquisition of two freehold houses at Draycott Place, located just 800m from Harrods. The acquisition was made with equity participation from a Middle Eastern bank. The vendors have already obtained planning approval and Saffron just needs to take care of the additions and alterations to the interior of the building. Plans are underway to turn the property into 10 apartments with sizes starting from 1,600 sq ft, says Ng. The level of quality and finishing of the apartments are expected to be comparable to those at the ultra luxury One Hyde Park. There is space to add two studio apartments. Given the projects prestigious location, the market price of the apartments is in the range of 3,500 to 4,000 psf. That translates to asking prices of 6 million to 25 million per unit. If we were to put it on the market today, the apartments will sell out in a very short time as there are a lot of people who would love to live in [them], says Dhimi. Draycott Place at Knightsbridge, which Saffron Homes acquired with equityparticipation by a Middle Eastern bank, where planning approval has beenobtained for 10 apartments and 12 underground parking When additions and alterations are completed, the project at Draycott Place will have the quality finishing of One Hyde Park Boutique projectsSaffron Homes intends to stick to its niche of boutique developments. We dont want to go into large-scale developments with a few hundred units, says Nawaz. Many of the investors weve been talking to are those we have [established a] relationship with over the years, and they understand the London market. While some of Saffrons offshore structures and special-purpose vehicles are based in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) or Guernsey, Dhimi does not see any cause for concern, even in the wake of greater scrutinity in such offshore vehicles following the recent Panama Papers leak. Nawaz adds that the only tax that investors in the investment vehicles will be subjected to is a 20% corporate tax. Interest in these schemes has been equally strong among investors in both Singapore and Malaysia. We dont offer these opportunities as agents on behalf of developers, he adds. We offer them as a development opportunity in a joint venture (JV) with Saffron Homes. According to Norman Ho, partner in law firm Rodyk & Davidsons real estate practice, such offshore companies are often used by parties to minimise tax liabilities. But being tax efficient does not equate to tax avoidance, he says. And it cannot be assumed that an offshore vehicle is used for improper purposes. Marketing agency turned developerLike Saffron, another property group that is changing its strategy is Strawberry Star Group, founded in 2006 by its chairman, Santhosh Gowda, and set up in London in 2007. Strawberry Stars maiden investment was in Berkeley Homes Chelsea Bridge Wharf, where it invested 18 million. That was our first acquisition, says Gowda. We underwrote the project and sold the units to individual investors. In 2012, Strawberry Star undertook the development of Sky Gardens in Vauxhall, Nine Elms. The project has over 200 units and was developed in partnership with Frasers Property UK, the UK property arm of Singapore listed property group Frasers Centrepoint Ltd. It will be completed this year. The 999-year leasehold Sky Gardens contains 204one- and two-bedroom apartments and is scheduledto be completed by end-2016 or early 2017 Source: Strawberry Star Hoola, a 360-unit residential development developedby Strawberry Star in partnership with HUB,is located at the Royal Victoria Dock in London Another project is Hoola, which Strawberry Star acquired from UK developers Hub in 2014. Located at Londons Royal Victoria Dock, the 360-unit development with a mix of studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments is scheduled for completion this year. Last year, Strawberry Star also invested in the 1 billion Asian Business Port (ABP) project in Royal Albert Dock in East London, jointly with Chinese developer Advanced Business Park. Strawberry Star invested 34 million in the first phase of the project, and is expected to invest up to 98 million in total, making ABP its biggest investment to date. Gowda: Were confident that we can now deliverprojects like mainstream developers, and we wantto reach out to people in Asia and the Middle Eastto join hands with us Scaling upTo date, Strawberry Star Group has aggregate investments totalling 500 million and a develop ment pipeline of more than 1,000 units, says Gowda. Over the last five years, it has also formed its own development, sales and market ing as well as leasing teams. Were confident that we can now deliver projects like mainstream developers, and we want to reach out to people in Asia and the Middle East to join hands with us, he adds. Besides a presence in London, Strawberry Star now has an office in Hong Kong and Singapore. Gowda had set up his family office and holding company KSD Holdings in Singapore in 2006. Prior to that, he spent 10 years in the Middle East, marketing projects to nonresident Indians working there who wanted to invest in property back home. The group has a division called Strawberry Star Capital, which focuses on identifying investment opportunities and raising funds to secure the investments. In January, Straw berry Star launched its first property investment fund after securing 25 million. The firm also announced that it has secured a commitment of another 50 million from co-investors in the Middle East, Asia and the US. Were looking at deploying the fund in a couple of investments, adds Gowda. New starStrawberry Star also announced the appointment of Doris Tan as regional director from the start of 2016. Tan, an international property veteran of more than 30 years, was heading the international residential property team in JLL before this. She had joined JLL after her firm, DST International, which she founded in 1998, was acquired by JLL five years ago. A lot of smaller developers from Singapore are keen to enter the London market but they dont know how to get started, says Tan. Now, we can help them [look] for the right site, raise capital, develop the project, and then sell the units downstream, as well as manage them on behalf of investors after the sale. Tan will be overseeing Strawberry Stars operations in both Singapore and Hong Kong. According to Gowda, the primary objective of opening offices in Singapore and Hong Kong is to raise more equity for our investments in London. Typically, Strawberry Star will look at develop ment projects of 150 to 250 units. Tan says the minimum investment by investors in Straw berry Stars projects is 5 million to 10 million. The profile of the investor is very important, she says. Were not targeting the man in the street. First, the investors must have experience investing in London. If they prefer to be passive investorst but are prepared to provide funding, they can enjoy the returns. Tan: Were not targeting the man in the street. Theinvestors must have experience investing in London.If they do not but are prepared to provide funding,they can enjoy the returns. Joint venturesThe group is also looking at forming JVs with UK government councils to build homes for the local communities, primarily in Zones 3 and 4 in London. According to Gowda, while prices of prime Central London have peaked, there is still a housing shortage in the Greater London area. In a JV with the councils, we dont have to pay for the land upfront, but we will provide funding for the construction, he adds. Thats where investors from Singapore can invest with Strawberry Star. Thats where the demand for housing is. Tan says she will continue to tap her network of overseas developers and bring projects to Singapore. On April 14, Strawberry Star showcased a project from Berlin. The project offers a mix of one- to two-bedroom units priced from 250,000 ($381,753) to 500,000. Tan adds that up to 70% bank financing will be provided. While the heady days of strong sales every weekend at overseas property exhibitions may be over, Saffrons Nawaz sees the rise of new opportunities. It was a good ride while it lasted, he says. But the strategy of selling projects off-plan at overseas property exhibitions was always going to be short-lived. As for us, were the developers and were offering investors the opportunity to invest alongside us.

VIIO at Balestier, an 11-storey mixed-use development at 520 Balestier Road by boutique developer Techkon Source: Techkon We had been looking around for a residential site to purchase, says George Goh, managing director of Techkon. Having visited several properties within Balestier, the company was convinced it was the right location as the area had transformed from a red-light district into a sought-after city-fringe residential neighbourhood. Therefore, when Leong On Building became available on the market, Techkon decided to acquire it. According to Goh, VIIO at Balestier will also benefit from being adjacent to Hiap Hoe Ltds Zhongshan Park, an integrated development with two hotels, Days Hotel Singapore and Ramada Singapore, as well as an office tower and two-storey mall. VIIO at Balestier is expected to attract investors as well as owner occupiers, given its city-fringe location: It is a 10-minute drive from both the CBD and Orchard Road. Apartments in the area have also attracted those working in the medical field, given that it is equidistant from the Thomson Medical Centre at one end of Balestier Road, and the Novena medical cluster with the likes of Novena Medical Centre, Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital and Medical Centre as well as Tan Tock Seng Hospital at the other end. Founded 15 years ago, Techkon carved a niche for itself by building the sales galleries and show flats of other developers condominium projects, such as CapitaLands Glentrees at Mount Sinai and the 73-unit Scotts Highpark on Scotts Road, Keppel Lands landmark Reflections at Keppel Bay, as well as Sing Holdings The Laurels at Cairnhill.

When completed at end-2017, VIIO will have 56 residential units spanning seven storeys sitting on top of a three-storey retail podium with 22 strata shop units. There will also be a sky garden with a 33m lap pool. The residential and retail components will have their own dedicated entrances, with a separate car park podium. The majority of the residential units at VIIO are two-bedroom types from compact, standard to dualkey apartments sized between 474 sq ft and 840 sq ft. There are 14 units of each type. There are also 14 three-bedroom dual-key units sized at 1,076 sq ft each. Absolute prices of the residential units in the project are said to start from $750,000 to $1.5 million, with an average price of $1,450 psf. To date, 15 units, or 30%, of the apartments at VIIO were reserved by existing clients, friends and business associates of Techkons directors, says Goh. Techkon will manage VIIOs three-storey retail podium to earn recurring income The two-bedroom, 474 sq ft units at VIIO start from $750,000 A three-bedroom, dual-key 1,076 sq ft unit is priced at $1.5 million Prices trimmed, design overhauledOwing to the property cooling measures, Techkon has trimmed the average selling price of the residential units at VIIO by 15% to $1,450 psf, he adds. In addition to that, Techkon went back to the drawing board two years ago and completely overhauled the design of its units and downsized them. The earlier incarnation of VIIO was first launched in 2014; it had 48 residential units and 30 strata shops. At that time, units were priced from $1 million to $2 million, or an average of $1,700 psf. We managed to sell three units, but decided to stop sales and relook our development plans, explains Goh. The move was made when a number of interested buyers dropped out as they were unable to obtain financing owing to tighter borrowing limits after the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) was imposed in June 2013. The developer has since refunded the three buyers their deposits, he says. As residential sales across Singapore plunged owing to the TDSR, introduced on top of eight successive rounds of property cooling measures, Goh applied for a change-of-use for VIIO in late 2014. The first was for it to be a hotel, which was rejected. Techkon then applied to use it as an office block. Again, the URA turned that down. Goh then decided to bring in MKPL Architects to design the latest version of VIIO at Balestier. The retail podium was reconfigured from a conventional mall to a pedestrian friendly mall, with direct street access to the shops on the first level and escalators leading to more shops on the two upper floors. Goh: 15 units or 30% of the apartments at VIIO have been reserved by existingclients, friends and business associatesof Techkons directors A seamless connection will also be built to link it to neighbouring Zhongshan Park Mall, says Siew Man Kok, chairman and founding partner of MKPL, winner of the Presi dents Design Awards Singapore 2015. MKPL also removed the basement level, which will help reduce the construction cost. For now, the shop units in the retail podium will be managed by Techkon and will not be offered for sale. The company intends to hold the commercial units for lease to earn recurring income. It has engaged Daven Wong, sole proprietor of Kylou Properties, to handle the marketing of VIIO. Wong reckons the shop units can be leased at rental rates ranging from $8 to $16 psf per month. The latest residential project to be completed in the vicinity is the freehold 115-unit Skysuites 17 by EL Development, which was completed in 2014. The most recent transaction at the 30-storey Skysuites 17 was for a 10th floor, 1,066 sq ft three-bedroom unit that changed hands for $1.41 million ($1,323 psf) last month, according to a caveat lodged with URA Realis. Wong says the asking prices of $1,450 psf at VIIO is competitive as it is a freehold mixed-use development and next to Zhongshan Park. On the other hand, Skysuites 17 which is also adjacent to Zhongshan Park is a condo development, says Wong.

In the fourth quarter of last year, there were also nine deals, but they were worth only S$161 million; in Q1 last year, there were just four transactions that added up to S$95 million.Douglas Wong, head of luxury homes at CBRE Realty Associates, commented: \"Owners who bought GCBs several years ago have found it profitable to sell at today's prices rather than later, in view of the uncertainties in the economic outlook.\"Realstar's Mr Wong estimates that GCB prices posted in Q1 this year were nearly 15 per cent lower than they were in the peak in 2013. \"Prices are gradually stabilising. However, a few GCBs sold below market valuation from late last year to Q1 this year would have an impact on overall GCB pricing. So there's likely going to be a further marginal drop of 2 to 5 per cent before prices stabilise by the fourth quarter of this year.\"CBRE's Mr Wong also predicts \"a very marginal price decline\" at most for the rest of this year, citing a build-up in pent-up demand as well as the strong holding power among most owners.He said: \"When owners lower their price expectations, buyers who have identified a property they fancy will start biting, in the fear that someone else may beat them to it and they'll miss the boat to buy their dream home. It could then take them many more months to hunt for another another bungalow they like.\"When buyers jump into the market in this fashion, owners will start to hold prices.\"Another GCB veteran, Newsman Realty managing director KH Tan, argued that prices have stabilised and in some cases, started going up last month, when the stock market began to recover.Last month, he brokered the sale of a bungalow along Swettenham Close off Holland Road at S$1,354 psf on land area - higher than the S$1,258 psf fetched last November for a bungalow along Peel Road, just 100 m away.Mr Tan said: \"And don't forget, the Peel Road bungalow was built about four years ago, while the Swettenham Close house is around 25 years old.\"Agents say the mood among buyers has improved lately, with a pick-up in viewings.Mr Tan said: \"We're receiving more serious offers, unlike in Q4 last year, when many potential buyers were still throwing low-ball numbers at owners.\"For the whole of this year, I'm predicting 5 per cent price growth.\"CBRE Research expects 30 to 35 GCBs to be sold this year - similar to the 33 transactions last year.The 2015 sales tally amounted to almost S$715 million and was an improvement from 2014, when 28 deals adding up to S$626 million were sealed.Mr Wong of Realstar predicts 20 to 30 per cent growth in the number of deals this year, though the value of transactions may increase just 20 per cent, factoring in lower GCB prices in the earlier part of this year.Agents told The Business Times that those in the market to buy a GCB include upgraders. Mr Tan of Newsman Realty said: \"Some are moving from a smaller landed house or even an apartment, to a GCB.\"I'm working with several HNWI (high-net-worth-individual) Singaporeans who're switching from overseas property markets back to Singapore.\"They believe that following the price correction, prospects for high-end residences will be better in Singapore in the next two years vis-a-vis the UK, the US, Australia and Japan and Hong Kong, where they had previously focused on.\"Some of these buyers include those who have become Singapore citizens in the past few years. \"What they are doing now is looking to reduce exposure to the ABSD (additional buyer's stamp duty) for instance, by selling their existing properties here or transferring them to family members,\" Mr Tan added.As for the profile of sellers, Mr Wong of Realstar has lately seen a number of people looking to divest their GCB because it has become too big for their needs, as their children may be working abroad.Mr Tan said \"in the past year, there have been more estates/trustees wanting to divest GCBs because of higher property taxes and weaker rents\". Among those who bought a GCB in Q1 this year was David Teo, chairman of listed Super Group. He is paying S$24.5 million or S$1,626 psf for a freehold property along Fifth Avenue off Bukit Timah Road."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Geylang has the highest supply pipeline with at least 1,200 units. However, its proximity to the CBD, Paya Lebar growth corridor and industrial areas in the East mitigates the risk of severe rental downside. However, shoebox rents in the North-East Region will be under pressure given at least 2,000 shoebox units have recently been, or will soon be, completed. While the development of the Punggol Creative Cluster and Learning Corridor will boost rental demand, competition for tenants will be stiff. In addition, there will a bumper supply of new HDB flats that will soon fulfil their five-year Minimum Occupation Period, which will compete in the rental market. The full impact on shoebox rents, as a result, has yet to be felt. Estimated number of shoebox units that have recently been, or will soon be, completed Graphic by Kim SY Projects in the pipeline with a substantial number of shoebox units include Midtown Residences, Parc Centros, Riversails, The Promenade @ Pelikat and Vibes@ Upper Serangoon. The vacancy rate for apartments and condominiums in the North-East Region stood at 12.3% and 11.9% respectively as at 1Q2016. The East Region trailed closely with at least 1,500 shoebox units that have recently been, or will soon be, completed. The bulk of these are located in Pasir Ris from projects such as DNest, Ripple Bay and The Inflora. The vacancy rates for apartments and condominiums in the East Region stood at 8.7% and 10.4% respectively as at 1Q2016. Shoebox rents have fallen by more than 20% since their peak Landlords of shoebox units have lost about $600 per month, or a quarter of their rental income, as rents plunged from their peak in 3Q2013. Monthly rents for shoebox homes, defined here as those measuring 500 sq ft or less, dived 23% from $2,792 in 3Q2013 to $2,139 on average in 1Q2016. The analysis is based on rental data mined by the URA. In contrast, the average rent for all private, non-landed homes has fallen by a slower 12% over the same period. Shoebox rents have also performed worse than large units with four bedrooms and above. The average rent for the latter has fallen by a slower rate of 15%. Meanwhile, the average rent for two-bedroom units has declined by around 13%. For investors, this means having 1.6 percentage points shaved off their rental yields. Assuming they purchased the units direct from the developer at $1,327 psf, which was the median price for shoebox homes in 2010, they would have enjoyed 6.2% gross rental yields when the units were completed and rented out in 2013. However, todays rent would knock the yields down to 4.6%. Mass-market segment led rental fall Although a 4.6% gross rental yield is mouth-watering, potential investors should note that the performance is not uniform across market segments. The mass-market segment, or Outside Central Region, has performed the worst by far. Shoebox rents in this segment tumbled 24% from $2,502 per month in 3Q2013s peak to $1,906 psf in 1Q2016. The most compelling reason for this is competition from HDB flats. For the same rent, or around $1,900 per month, tenants have the option of renting three-room HDB flats in mature estates, which include Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Bukit Merah, Clementi, Kallang/Whampoa, Marine Parade, Queenstown, Serangoon and Toa Payoh. The other option is a four-room HDB flat in non-mature estates. In the high-end segment, or Core Central Region, shoebox rents declined by a smaller percentage of 17%, from $3,269 per month in 1Q2013 to $2,698 in 1Q2016. Those in the city fringe, or Rest of Central Region, fell 21% from $2,675 to $2,103 per month over the same period. On a y-o-y basis, the high-end segment performed the worst, with shoebox rents falling 8% compared with 4% in the city fringe and 5% in the mass market. This is likely due to a temporary spike in the supply of shoebox units in recent years. The steep rental fall was confined to just a few projects. Shoebox rents at Illuminaire on Devonshire and Robertson Edge fell by a double-digit percentage owing to competition from newer projects in their vicinity including Espada, RV Edge and Vivace. In the CBD, shoebox rents at The Clift also fell steeply, presumably because of competition from Skysuites @ Anson, which was completed in 2014. Owing to a limited supply pipeline, we expect this trend to reverse, with the high-end segment outperforming other segments in the coming years. Q-o-q, shoebox rents held firm in 1Q2016 with a 0.1% increase in the high-end segment, but dipped 1.1% in the city fringe and 3.4% in the mass market. For tenants, this poses an opportunity to live in the prime districts. In 2013, a $2,300 rental budget afforded them shoebox units in Telok Kurau or Kovan areas. Today, it is possible to rent units atLoft @ Stevens,RV EdgeorWilkie 80at similar or slightly higher rents.

I have no intention to be confrontational,\" Mr Choong told The Straits Times on Friday (April 22) ahead of Nobel's annual general meeting (AGM).The lawsuit was seen as part of the power tussle between Mr Choong, also a founder and 24 per cent shareholder of the furnishing and property firm, and the current management. Following the lawsuit he was voted out of the board at last year's AGM.Mr Choong had, in turn, been highly critical of the accounting and corporate governance at Nobel Design, which had to revise its financial statements for 2014 in last September.A year later, Mr Choong now shows a much less hostile stance towards Nobel's top figures, saying that the firm is doing the best it can in a choppy business environment.\"I'm only (attending the AGM) as a shareholder, and my only concerns are that there should be more transparency on the remuneration for the chief executive and chief operating officer,\" he said, referring to a lack of exact figures on this front in the annual report.\"I'm also worried that shareholders are not properly awarded with the dwindling level of dividend,\" Mr Choong added. Dividend last year was down 13.8 per cent to 0.56 cents a share.These concerns were voiced and addressed peacefully at the AGM, where all resolutions were passed.Mr Chan explained that the total dividend paid out actually rose 19 per cent to S$1.4 million last year, and other shareholders have expressed approval for a more conservative approach to dividend payout. Nobel had another difficult year in 2015, when net profit dropped 24.4 per cent to S$16.7 million.\"It hasn't been easy in Singapore given the stagnant property market, which also hurt demand for furnishings. Fortunately our businesses are diversified, and there are bright spots elsewhere,\" chief executive Mr Goon noted.\"Our revenue from the United States, where we supply to online retailers, have shown further growth and is now around 60 per cent of the group's sales,\" he added.

It is expected to take a stake of about 75 per cent in entities owning the properties; the deal values the properties at about S$300 million. The yield, on an ungeared basis, is estimated at 6 per cent.Sime Darby, the listed Malaysian plantation-based conglomerate, is selling the properties to reduce debt.The properties are Sime Darby Centre at 896 Dunearn Road; Sime Darby Enterprise Centre, a light industrial building along Jalan Kilang off Jalan Bukit Merah; and Sime Darby Business Centre at 315 Alexandra Road (next to IKEA).Of these, the biggest ticket item is Sime Darby Centre - an office and retail development on freehold and 999-year leasehold land parcels zoned for commercial use and with 1.8 plot ratio (ratio of maximum gross floor area to land area).Part of this property used to house a BMW showroom; today, some of Sime Darby's Singapore offices are still located there but the retail-and-office building also has third-party tenants such as Scanteak, Cold Storage and ToTT Cooking Studio.The other two properties are light industrial developments sitting on Business 1-zoned sites with 2.5 plot ratio; they are on sites with a balance lease of around 40 years.Sime Darby's other properties on the island include 303 Alexandra Road, also known as Sime Darby Performance Centre and where the main BMW showroom for new cars is located, and 280 Kampong Arang Road in the Mountbatten/Tanjong Rhu area, housing a showroom for second-hand BMWs. Sources say the combined value of these five assets could exceed S$500 million.One property in the deal, the one beside Ikea in Alexandra Road, also has a second-hand BMW showroom.Sime Darby unit Performance Motors distributes BMWs.The three properties will be income-generating for Blackstone - as Sime entities occupying space there can be expected to lease back the space upon completion of the deal.Commenting on the various divestment options that Sime Darby would have considered, market watchers told The Business Times that given the weak equity markets, spinning off the properties into a real estate investment trust (Reit) would be challenging.To ensure a successful Reit IPO, Sime Darby would have to divest the properties at a lower price to match, if not surpass, the current high yields at which Reits are trading. A more fundamental issue is that a portfolio of the three properties lacks scale for a Reit IPO.Selling the assets to an existing Reit would also be difficult as Sime Darby's pricing is unlikely to be yield accretive for the buyer.For Blackstone, a potential exit strategy for the three properties would be to spruce them up, boost their value and then offload them, possibly on a piecemeal basis. On the other hand, there could be a scenario of acquiring more properties to assemble a bigger portfolio for a potential Reit listing.An industry observer said: \"For the seller, the decision to sell a majority stake in three assets to Blackstone is probably the best solution - given current market conditions.\"In February, Sime Darby said that it was aiming to raise RM1.8 billion (S$620 million) by selling assets in Australia and Singapore. President and group chief executive Mohd Bakke Salleh said that the monetisation programme would include commercial and industrial properties and that the company had identified 13 assets in Australia and three in Singapore.The goal is to reduce Sime Darby's gearing ratio to 0.54 times by the end of the financial year ending June 30, 2016 from 0.61 times as at end-December 2015 - through this asset monetisation programme as well as a RM3 billion perpetual sukuk, or Islamic bond, programme.For the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2015, Sime Darby posted a 38 per cent fall in net profit to RM273.3 million on the back of lower crude palm oil prices. Lower coal prices also hit the bottom line at the group's industrial unit."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Ian Lee, lead designer of the project, describes it as the new Asian luxury, where luxury is quiet, contemplative and, as paradoxical as it sounds, modest. Born to Malaysian-Chinese parents but raised in the UK, Lee admits to being more familiar with Western values and culture than his Asian roots. Nevertheless, he subconsciously draws from Asian influences in his design process, marrying them with his Westernised tastes. Hence, you are not likely to find heavily lacquered timber, fretwork screens or dogmatic minimalism in his design. Instead, you will find balance, restraint and serenity, which are highly valued in Asian societies. Throughout the interior spaces, dualities in form, texture and colour are skilfully balanced. Clean lines bring out the patterned surfaces of natural stone and timber, while the hardness of these materials is softened with flowing drapes. The space is amply filled with cushions and plush throws and rugs. Dark millwork forms a reticent backdrop for furniture mostly in light grey and beige tones. Balancing contemporary and classic In the living area, a full-height shelving unit with a hidden TV compartment has sliding doors clad in faux shagreen. Shagreen is a highly sought-after decorative material dating back to the Chinese Han Dynasty and has graced the sword hilts of the Japanese samurai and the trinkets of French aristocrats alike. Commonly sourced from East Asia, it is traditionally found in the homes of the very rich around the world and deemed an exotic and precious material by those in the know. A sense of balance is also apparent in the furniture selection. Anchoring the space is a modern, classic L-shaped sofa, paired with a rectilinear coffee table. There is stability in the stance of the table, yet a sense of lightness as it seems to hover just above the soft carpet. Balancing out the conservative silhouettes of the sofa and coffee table is a very hip and unexpected form of an armchair with its pillowy upholstery the Husk by Patricia Urquiola and a wireframe end table, both of which exude playfulness and freshness. Balance out conservative silhouettes with unexpected forms such as the playful Husk armchair by Patricia Urquiola The courtyard concept The penthouse unit comes with a sky garden, which has two main spaces a lounge area and an outdoor dining area. The sky garden does not pretend to be a traditional Asian courtyard, but it serves to contain family- oriented activities. A bright red Kub low table by Japanese design studio Nendo gives the lounge area an upbeat vibe. Spacious sanctuary Timber blinds over a glass screen separate the bedroom from the master bathroom, a spare and clutter-free space that has a freestanding tub to complete the experience of a private Zen-like sanctuary. A free-standing tub makes the bath appear spacious and clutter-free, creating a private Zen-like sanctuary Luxury with restraint In the dining area, a bespoke marble table is arguably the showpiece of the apartment. Composed of Italian marble with timber accents, this three-metre table may not be Asian in appearance, but it is so in essence. It was designed to be a gathering place, drawing families together for a meal in traditional Asian style. It is luxurious without being ostentatious, as its designer, Charlton Ho of Creative Mind Design, explains. Bullnose detailing, as well as the choice of white Carrara marble, make this potentially clunky table appear elegantly sleek. We also made sure the proportions are generous enough to seat the whole family comfortably. He explains that timber laminate strips were incorporated to complement the dark millwork in the rest of the apartment. For the dining chairs, Lee selected the iconic mid-century Platner Arm Chairs in ivory. With their graceful wire structure and comfortable upholstery, they are a picture of elegance or, in other words, restrained luxury. Bullnose detailing and thechoice of white Carrara marblemake this potentially chunkytable appear sleek and modest Serenity in style The quiet luxury of the common areas carries over into the bedrooms. Fuss-free fabrics in a neutral palette create a calming, restful mood, with punches of statement Thai silk pillows from Jim Thompson to break the monotony, as described by Lee. In the master bedroom, he opted for dark timber strips that form a feature wall behind the headboard. To accessorise the space, he chose objects that are subtle but have character, such as exotic bedside table lamps with shagreen-clad stands sourced from Thailand. Instead of wallpaper, how about a feature wall made of dark timber laminate strips to add depth to the space and enhance the calming ambience Grace Chen is a communications writer/designer for Creative Mind Design, an award-wining interior design studio that crafts meaningful and relevant interior spaces, bringing fresh and compelling expe riences for all to enjoy.

Otherwise, our next course of action would be to try to extract an exit offer,\" Ms Sim said. \"Only when we are satisfied that the company has established the lack of financial resource for an exit offer will we allow a delisting without an offer.\"The report also marks the latest in a string of recent moves by the SGX to ramp up regulatory oversight on both listing applicants and listed companies.\"Recent improvements we have made at the admission stage include the introduction of the independent Listings Advisory Committee (LAC) and our new 2-stage listings review process,\" Mr Tan said.The new review process, implemented late last year, will first require issue managers to consult the SGX on potential issues that may be a deal-breaker. Where issues concerning reputational risks or public interest are involved, these cases will then be escalated to the LAC for review.The SGX is ready to reject applications by companies with business and governance issues, Mr Tan said, adding that the bourse plans to release in a few months' time another periodic report detailing, on a no-name basis, rejected listing applications.The requirements for listed companies have also been strengthened. For instance, companies with a primary listing in Singapore must now hold their annual general meetings here, and company boards must have at least two resident directors.The full package of SGX's regulatory initiatives is to improve risk prevention and law enforcement, Mr Tan noted, referring to SGX's referral of nine cases of insider trading and market manipulation to regulators in the first quarter.It is unclear whether these cases are linked to the broking house raids by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Commercial Affairs Department last month."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

All eyes are now on Gem Residences as it unveils its showflats and releases its unit prices on the weekend of May 20. The project previewed on Labour Day weekend (April 30 to May 2) with the opening of just the sales gallery. At least 1,036 people are said to have registered interest in the 578-unit development located on Toa Payoh Lorong 5 and Lorong 6. The developer is ramping up interest ahead of its VIP and public launch on May 27 and 28. We are trying to hit the magic number of 2,000 because theres always a certain level of attrition at the actual sales, says Vincent Ong, managing partner of Evia Real Estate. More than 1,000 people are said to have registered their interest in Gem Residences. Source: Gem Residences. Gem Residences is a joint project by Malaysian developer Gamuda Land with a 50% stake and its two Singapore-based partners, Evia Real Estate (20% stake) and Maxdin (30%), a subsidiary of construction company Greatearth Holdings. Gem Residences marks Gamuda Lands maiden foray into the Singapore property market. The property arm of Malaysia-listed engineering construction and investment firm Gamuda Bhd, Gamuda Land developed projects in Kuala Lumpur before venturing into Iskandar Malaysia eight years ago. Gamuda and its joint venture partner UEM Sunrise developed Horizon Hills, a 1,200- acre freehold township development with an 18-hole championship golf course. The project has been very popular with Singaporeans and expatriates over the years. Singapore is Gamudas latest overseas venture; it entered Vietnam a decade ago and purchased a development site in Melbourne last year, says Chow Chee Wah, Gamuda Lands managing director. We feel its a good time to enter Singapore now, and we were exploring several government land sites with Evia last year. We thought the Toa Payoh site was ideal, as there hasnt been a new private condo launch there in a long time. At the close of the tender, there were 14 bids with Gamuda and its joint venture partners submitting the top bid of $345.86 million ($755 psf per plot ratio) for the 130,832 sq ft site. Artists impression of the 578-unit Gem Residences with 37- and 38-storey towers First launch of private condo since 2009The last private condo to be launched in Toa Payoh was the 590-unit Trevista by Choice Homes in 2009. The 99- year leasehold condo project in Toa Payoh Lorong 3 was fully sold and completed in 2011. Prior to that, there were only two other private condos launched in the area, which is predominantly an HDB estate. One was the 384-unit freehold Trellis Towers in Toa Payoh Lorong 1, which was launched in late 1996 by CDL and completed in 2000. The other was the 99-year leasehold Oleander Towers, also located on Lorong 1, which was developed by Wing Tai Holdings. Launched in late 1995, the project was completed in 1998. Resale prices in Toa Payoh have also been resilient. Units at the 99-year leasehold Oleander Towers, which is almost 20 years old, changed hands at $988 to $1,043 psf in 1Q2016. In recent months, units at Trellis Towers have been sold at $1,266 and $1,342 psf. Meanwhile, Trevistas resale prices of mid-floor units ranged from $1,210 to $1,315 psf from February to April, according to caveats lodged with URA Realis. Gem Residences will be the fourth private condo in Toa Payoh in 50 years, says Evias Ong. So, we feel theres a certain level of pent-up demand. Among the more than 1,000 people who have expressed interest in the project, 35% live in Toa Payoh and 30% within a 5km radius, including Ang Mo Kio, Bishan and Balestier. The most-sought-after units are the two- and three-bedroom apartments, which garnered 30% and 25% interest respectively. Triple-key units a noveltyClose to 60% of the units at Gem Residences are one- and two-bedroom units measuring 452 to 775 sq ft. Another 30% are three-bedroom units of 936 to 1,055 sq ft; and there are 37 each of four- and five-bedroom units measuring 1,249 sq ft and 1,313 sq ft respectively. There are only two penthouses: a 1,636 sq ft, four-bedroom unit; and a 2,045 sq ft, six-bedroom unit. Of the 172 three-bedroom units, 37 have been designed as trio or triple-key units of 936 sq ft each, which is a novelty in the market. The trio unit will have a main entrance and foyer that opens up to three separate suites. Each suite will be a standalone apartment with its own living room and kitchenette, bedroom and en suite bathroom as well as a balcony. The foyer can be a common area for the occupants shoe racks, umbrella stand and washing machine and dryer, says Evias Ong. Each suite will also have its own sub-meter to allow the landlord to monitor the tenants utility usage and bill accordingly. However, its still one property title for one triokey unit, explains Ong. Interest in these 37 trio units have been so overwhelming that they will have to be sold by balloting at launch, reckons Ong. While there is strong investor interest in Gem Residences, Ong says he also detects a nostalgia factor among the buyers because Toa Payoh, being the first HDB town in Singapore, is the most established in terms of amenities. Many of these young families want to move back to Toa Payoh because its where they grew up, and their parents are still living there, he says. Chow: We thought the Toa Payoh site was ideal, as there hasnt been a new private condo launch in a long time Ong: We want to differentiate ourselves by focusing on providing services to make things more convenient for our residents Providing communal servicesThe project is adjacent to the Seu Teck Sean Tong Temple and within walking distance of the Braddell MRT station. Every project has a 50m swimming pool and tennis court, says Ong. So, we want to differentiate ourselves by being buyer-centric and focusing on providing services to make things more convenient for our residents. As part of the governments efforts to make Singapore car-light, the developer of Gem Residences has also tied up with Smove to provide residents with a car-sharing system. There will also be a bicycle rack for 100 bicycles and 30 communal bicycles for residents use, as well as a taxi bay for cab and Uber or Grab drivers. As more than half the units are one- and two-bedroom apartments, Ong foresees that most of the residents will be singles and young couples. The developer will provide dedicated uniformed housekeeping staff for the convenience of residents, who can book the services and pay an hourly rate. Showflat of a one-bedroom unit at Gem Residences. The fully fitted unit comes with Smeg appliances such as oven, refrigerator and washer-dryer. Source: Gem Residences Ong reckons that residents of the four- and five-bedroom units are likely to be multi-generational families, as Toa Payoh is an ageing estate with an ageing population. Units are designed to be wheelchair-friendly and, for the convenience of the elderly or disabled, the developer will provide a mobile medical clinic with a doctor and nurse on duty on weekends. Concierge staff will be on hand to help residents hail a cab and with other needs. Parcel lockers will be provided for registered mail deliveries and the convenience of those who shop online, adds Ong. When Gem Residences is completed in 2020, the developer will present each owner with a compendium of all the available services, including food and grocery delivery, engaging a private chef for parties, and cleaning services. The project comes with a 6,000 sq ft clubhouse with a gym, barbecue and grill areas and fully equipped function rooms for private parties. Beyond the full condominium facilities, there are also dedicated pet amenities for dogs with a pet run, pet pool and pet shower. Ong estimates that 7% of the residents at Gem Residences are likely to have pets. Competitive pricingGem Residences has a guide price averaging $1,480 psf. The actual prices of units will be released on May 20, a week before sales begin. We want to give potential buyers enough time to consider their purchase without duress, says Ong. They will have time to consult their bankers and discuss with their family members before committing to their purchases. The developer is offering an early bird discount in the form of a cheque to buyers. The discount is $7,500 for unit purchases below $800,000; and $10,000 for purchases above $800,000. In the current market, property agents continue to collect cheques [as an expression of interest], says Ong. Cheque collection prior to a launch works in a market in which demand outstrips supply, he says. In the current market, where there are more units pursuing buyers, however, it may not be necessary, he adds. The preview of Gem Residences coincided with the public launch of Sturdee Residences, a 99-year leasehold condo located off Jalan Besar. The VIP preview for Sturdee Residences was held on April 23 and 24, and 122 of a total of 305 units were sold. Another 10 units were snapped up at the launch weekend. Thus, the project is 43% sold at an average of $1,550 psf. Boutique developer Techkon held the soft launch of Viio @ Balestier at end-April. Over the past three weeks, 40% of 56 freehold residential units sitting on top of a three-storey retail podium have been sold at an average price of $1,450 psf. Glitterati at Stars of KovanMay 7 marked the VIP preview of Cheung Kong Property Holdings Stars of Kovan. The Li Ka-shing-controlled property group unveiled its $10 million sales gallery and showflats last weekend, drawing 4,000 visitors. The 99-year leasehold project is located at the junction of Tampines Road and Upper Serangoon Road and within the Kovan residential estate, which comprises mostly houses and private condos. A mixed-use scheme, Stars of Kovan contains 390 private condo units in four 17-storey blocks sitting on top of a retail podium. Adjoining it is a row of five strata terraced houses. One of the main attractions is that the project is mixed-use, says Joseph Tan, executive director of residential services at CBRE. The other attraction is its proximity to the Kovan MRT station just across the road. A total of 4,000 people visited the Stars of Kovan showflat at the VIP preview on May 7 and 8 The British-style retail podium of Stars of Kovan will have 46 commercial units with a mix of retail and F&B space. It is set to raise the bar on quality mixed developments in Singapore, says Tan. The closest shopping centre is the ageing 32-year-old Heartland Mall adjacent to the Kovan MRT station. Condo units at Stars of Kovan are a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments measuring 506 to 1,023 sq ft, with absolute prices said to range from $800,000 to $1.5 million. The two-bedroom units measuring 732 to 807 sq ft were the most popular among Singaporean investors, according to Cheung Kong Property. The indicative price range is said to be $1,550 to $1,600 psf. The project is scheduled to be launched on May 21, with CBRE and Huttons Asia as joint marketing agents. The race is on for the two projects Stars of Kovan and Gem Residences that are set to be launched over the next fortnight. Developers will therefore have to sharpen their edge in terms of product differentiation, says a veteran property consultant who declined to be named.

Four out of the five mortgagee sales are said to have originated from a developer. The developer is believed to be C&C Development, which was started by entrepreneur Ritchie Chua and incorporated in 2009. This could signal the start of a wave of distressed sales from boutique developers who entered the market at the peak in 2013 and now find themselves cash-strapped and unable to complete the construction of their properties, says Grace Ng, veteran auctioneer and deputy managing director of Colliers International. Three of the four houses developed by C&C Development that have been repossessed by the bank are semi-detached units in Serangoon Gardens, while the fourth is a detached house in Seletar Hills. C&C Development could have overextended itself by acquiring a series of sites in quick succession at the top of the market, according to property agents familiar with the company. This is borne out by the previous caveats lodged for the four sites, all of which were made at the peak of the last property boom, between May and July 2013. The semi-detached 60 Burghley Drive will be put up for auction with a guide price of $3.8 million on May 24 In Serangoon Gardens, C&C Development built a new three-storey semi-detached house with a built-up area of 4,500 sq ft at 60 Burghley Drive. The developer had purchased the 999- year leasehold, 2,800 sq ft site for $3.15 million ($1,125 psf) in May 2013. On the site was a single-storey, semi-detached house that has since been torn down to make way for the new structure. The new house is said to have received its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP), but has yet to obtain its Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC). The property will be put up for auction with a guide price of $3.8 million ($1,357 psf). The house at 60 Burghley Drive was not the only purchase made by C&C Development in May 2013. Shortly after, it paid $5.86 million ($1,105 psf) for a 999-year leasehold, 5,296 sq ft bungalow site at 62 Berwick Drive. The developer then sub-divided the site into a pair of semi-detached houses with a land area of 2,650 sq ft each. The built-up area of each three-storey unit is 2,960 sq ft. While the exterior of the house appears to be completed, the interiors are still unfinished. Therefore, the properties have not obtained TOP yet, according to agents. The guide price for the two semi-detached houses at 62 and 62A Berwick Drive is said to be $3.5 million each. The pair of semi-detached houses at 62/62A Berwick Drive will be put up for auction by JLL on May 24. Both are mortgagee sales. In July 2013, C&C Development purchased an old detached house at 122 Mimosa Crescent in Seletar Hills for $8.68 million ($1,064 psf), according to a caveat lodged then. The former house has since been torn down and redeveloped into a 16,200 sq ft bungalow with four storeys and a basement. The house is also partially completed and has not obtained TOP. The property sits on a freehold land with an area of 8,157 sq ft. The guide price of the property at the auction is $10 million ($1,226 psf). High acquisition priceThe developer secured all three sites at relatively high prices an average of $1,100 psf observes Sharon Lee, head of auction at Knight Frank. Only an individual buying a house for his own use will pay such prices, she says. A typical developer would generally offer prices in the range of $800 to $900 psf as they need to price in the construction cost. Assuming an average cost of $300 psf to $400 psf for the construction of a house, Lee reckons that the 4,500 sq ft semi-detached house at 60 Burghley Drive could have been built for $1.35 million to $1.8 million. She estimates the pair of semi- detached houses at 62 and 62A Berwick Drive to cost between $890,000 and $1.2 million each. Meanwhile, the construction cost of the 16,200 sq ft detached house at Mimosa Crescent may have been in the ballpark of $4.86 million to $6.5 million. This means the estimated total cost of the semi-detached house land and construction at Burghley Drive is $4.55 million to $4.95 million, while the pair of semi-detached houses at Berwick Drive are likely to round up at $7.64 million to $8.26 million. Meanwhile, the detached house at Mimosa Crescent is estimated to be in the range of $13.54 million to $15.18 million. The guide prices of the properties are below these estimated costs. This four-storey detached house at 122 Mimosa Crescent with a built-up area 16,200 sq ft will be put up for auction by JLL The developers string of site purchases coincided with the introduction of the total debt servicing ratio loan framework at end- June 2013, which put a limit on peoples ability to borrow for their property purchases. The TDSR had further dampened market sentiments and the overall buying mood as it came within months of the hike in the additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) in January 2013. The developer may not have anticipated the downshift in the market following the TDSR, concedes Mok Sze Sze, head of auction at JLL. RedevelopmentsBesides the TDSR, which constricted the pool of buyers in the landed housing segment, developers themselves were hit by the hike in ABSD to 15% in January 2013. For residential developments with four or fewer units, developers are only eligible for a remission on the 15% ABSD if they complete construction and sell all the units within three years of acquiring the site. When it comes to distressed assets, banks usually give an individual between three and six months to sell a property on his own, says Mok. If that fails, the bank will step in, have the property valued and appoint an auction house to sell it. For developers, its more difficult to gauge as the company may have other business dealings with the bank, she adds. Another mortgagee sale in the Serangoon Gardens neighbourhood is an existing 2- storey semi-detached house on Braemar Drive. The former owner, believed to be an individual, paid $990,000 for the 999-year leasehold 2,800 sq ft site in January 2007. The old property was rebuilt into the current 4,650 sq ft house, which was com pleted in 2013. The first time the property was put up for auction was in December 2015. It was last put up for auction by JLL in April with an opening price of $4.2 million, and was withdrawn without a bid. It is now available for sale by private treaty with an indicative price of $4.5 million. At Braemar Drive, a 2-storey semi-detached house on 999-year leasehold land is available for sale by private treaty, with an indicative price of $4.5 million There has been a rise in the number of mortgagee sales of landed homes in Serangoon Gardens, Yio Chu Kang, Bukit Timah and the neighbourhoods of Bedok and Changi in the east, according to Colliers Ng. This is because a lot of the boutique developers have zoomed in on popular landed housing estates, purchasing old houses on relatively large sites and redeveloping them for sale, she adds. Serangoon Gardens has been particularly popular with both owner occupiers and boutique developers as it is an established residential estate and is sought after by expatriate families given its proximity to two international schools, the Australian International School and French International School. Over the past decade, a lot of investors were also attracted to the area due to demand from expatriate families. Many of them snapped up old houses and redeveloped them into 2- to three-storey homes. Spike in mortgagee sales of housesBased on data by Colliers International, the number of houses put up for mortgagee sale has spiked from just four in 2013 to 50 in 2015 (see table). Source: Colliers International Research It looks like the number is set to increase this year. In 1Q2016 alone, close to 20 of the landed properties that were put up for auction were mortgagee sales. Most of them were corner terrace houses, semi-detached and detached houses. Some were strata landed homes. Generally, for the bigger landed properties such as bungalows or semi-detached houses, mortgagee sales occur because of business failure, says Colliers Ng. This is because the owners are likely to be entrepreneurs who may have mortgaged their properties to support their businesses. With the economic uncertainties, turbulence in the stock market, corporate restructuring and retrenchments across many sectors, auctioneers foresee more properties being placed under mortgagee sales. Borrowers who are experiencing difficulties servicing their loans are facing challenges in disposing their properties owing to the higher price tags that come with these larger landed homes, adds Ng. Landed property is also restricted to Singaporeans and permanent residents who also require approval from the Singapore Land Authoritys Land Dealings (Approval) Unit. PRs are also subjected to a higher ABSD of 5% for their first property since 2013. Therefore, the pool of buyers with financial means has shrunk further, and they are spoilt for choice today, says Ng. Therefore, the bigger landed homes are taking a longer time to sell and are likely to be put up for auction multiple times, she adds.

Caveats have been lodged for two units of between 1,880 and 1,980 sq ft and sold for between S$2,500 and S$2,700 psf.A CDL spokeswoman said that following the roadshows in Jakarta, Surabaya, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, deposits for some more units before issuance of options are pending; in addition to this, some overseas buyers have made or are making arrangements to come to Singapore to view the project.The 174-unit Gramercy Park will be launched in phases, starting with certain floors in its North Tower, followed by the remaining floors there. South Tower units will be launched after; the group said it is not looking at a block sale for the South Tower.Gramercy Park is expected to receive its temporary occupation permit in the second quarter of this year.Also located along Grange Road is OUE Twin Peaks, which has sold more than 120 units since late March. Of that number, 65 were sold by PropNex, one of the five marketing agencies. Units there went for around S$2,500 psf on average, based on caveats lodged.The deferred payment scheme offered for this development appears to have worked; agents said about 70 per cent of buyers since late March have opted for it. This is despite there being a lower price discount - 12 per cent instead of 15 per cent - for buyers who opt for it.Besides the deferred payment scheme, OUE Twin Peaks has another scheme that allows for a longer option-exercise date under private treaties. It has already obtained Certificates of Statutory Completion (CSC) and hence, is no longer subject to the provisions of the Housing Developers (Control & Licensing) Act and its rules."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Another project, Levit8, a foldable portable standing desk, has garnered close to US$60,000 on crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.Mr Jeffrey Ho, executive director of DesignSingapore Council, was impressed by the \"user-centric\" nature of many of the products. He told students: \"Some of the best talents in Singapore's design industry have started from where you are today...I look forward to you bringing the Singapore design brand to the world.\"Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

This translates into a price of approximately S$2,650 -$2,700 psf for the premium office development, which was completed 5 years ago in 2011.According to DBS analyst Derek Tan, assuming the average rent is S$10-11psf, this implies a net yield of 3.1-3.2% for the tower which comprises of close to 1.2 million sqft of office space and 40,000 sqft of retail area.Christine Li, Research Director, Cushman & Wakefield (C&W) commented that Asia Square Tower 1 is one of the most sought-after trophy assets by regional and international investors given its premium location in the heart of Marina Bay, Singapore's pre-eminent financial and business district.According to Li, The successful closing of the deal, with QIA could have been attributed to BlackRocks willingness to lower the price slightly, as previous negotiations with CapitaLand and ARA Asset management at the S$2,800 psf - S$3,000 psf range ended inconclusively. \"This price is comparable to the transaction of Marina Bay Financial Centre (MBFC) Tower 3 in 2014, where Keppel Land sold 1/3 stake to K-Reit at $2,680psf. However, the price pales in comparison to the recent transaction by Straits Trading building, which was sold to MYP controlled by Indonesian Tycoon Dr Tahir, at $3,520psf as it is a 999-leasehold and 100% fully occupied office building,\" she explainedAccording to C&W research, Asia Square Tower 1's current occupancy is around 91%, for both the office and retail portions. ImplicationsSector-wide, Tan notes that that the successful sell out of Asia Square Tower 1 have positive implications on Singapore as an investment destination for global investors.\"QIA is likely to be taking a longer-term view on its investment horizon given that it is acquiring the property with possibility of vacancies rising to c. 20% in the near term given expected tenant relocations. This is a further testament of the attractiveness of Singapore as an investment destination, supported by stable Singapore dollar (SGD) compared to regional currencies,\" he said. Tan adds that for patient investors, taking a view that current office weakness in rents is a function of a cyclical oversupply in completions over 2016-2017, the medium-term outlook remains robust given limited completions after 2019, implying a office squeeze once again then.Li concurred while adding that while office investment volume had come down significantly in the past year, the recent big-ticket transactions of Straits Trading Building and now Asia Square Tower 1 may give the market a shot in the arm and give other long-term investors confidence to venture forth and place bids for their desired properties.\"We believe that the Asia Square transaction could spur investors' interest, particularly those from sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies in the city-state, as Singapore is known for its ability to attract long-term investors looking for wealth preservation given the stable political landscape and strength of the Singapore currency,\" she said.Li also noted that the scarcity of the tradable Grade A assets is the reason why investors will have to contend with a low yield and a price premium. Over the last 10 years, the proportion of tradable assets is merely 7%, of which more than 50% is related party transactions, she said. Nevertheless, Li cautioned that the office leasing market faces challenges in the short term due to weak business conditions, with leasing demand impacted by headwinds in the banking, oil, and commodities sectors.\"The supply overhang of 3.55 million sf scheduled for completion in 2016 will likely lead to the Grade A CBD vacancy rate exceeding double digits by the end of the year. Accordingly, Grade A CBD rents are projected to moderate by a further 1012% in 2016, but stabilise in subsequent years given the significantly reduced supply pipeline in 2017 and 2018,\" she explained."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The deal announced on June 6 is said to be the single-largest office building transaction in the city-state and Asia-Pacific so far. The transaction will lead to increased confidence in the marketplace, says Greg Hyland, head of capital markets Singapore at JLL. There will definitely be more transactions in the next 12 months. JLL and CBRE were joint advisers for BlackRock on the sale. Hyland: The [Asia Square] transaction will lead to increased confidence in themarketplace. There will definitely be moretransactions in the next 12 months. Asia Squares transaction price of $3.4 billion translates to $2,650 psf, with an estimated gross yield of more than 3%. The successful closing of the deal with QIA could have been attributed to BlackRocks willingness to lower the price slightly, as previous negotiations with CapitaLand and ARA Asset management at the $2,800-to-$3,000 psf range ended inconclusively, says Christine Li, director of research at Cushman & Wakefield. Completed in 2011, Asia Square Tower 1 is a 43-storey tower with 1.25 million sq ft of net lettable Grade-A office space. Citibank has been an anchor tenant in Tower 1 since 2011 and occupies nine floors totalling more than 250,000 sq ft. The second tower, the 46-storey Asia Square Tower 2, was completed in 2013. Tower 2 is a mixed-use complex with about 780,000 sq ft of Grade-A office space on the lower floors and a hotel spanning the 32nd to 46th floors. Asia Square Tower 1 has just been sold for $3.4 billion, making it the single-largest office transaction this year Developing core assets with exit strategyThe two towers at Asia Square were built on two adjacent 99-year leasehold development sites on Marina View purchased from URA for a total of $2.97 billion in late 2007. The sites were then amalgamated and construction of the two towers was estimated to cost $2 billion then. The developer was private-equity real estate investment firm MGPA, which BlackRock acquired in October 2013. Asia Square Tower 1 was held in one of BlackRocks value add and opportunistic funds in Asia, says John Saunders, head of Asia-Pacific for BlackRock Real Estate. The plan was to develop a core asset, lease and stabilise the property, then exit. We produced returns commensurate with the risks taken for a ground-up greenfield development, he says. Were happy with the exit; were happy with the result. The sale of Asia Square Tower 1 was Part 2 of a three-part exit strategy. Part 1 was the sale of the 305-room Westin Singapore in Asia Square Tower 2 in December 2013. The buyer was Japan-based property developer and investor Daisho Group, which paid $468 million, or a record-breaking $1.5 million per key. The third part of the exit plan will be the sale of the remaining office block at Asia Square Tower 2. We will [sell it] eventually, says Saunders. The occupancy rate at Asia Square Tower 2 is about 80% and, with several leasing deals underway, the occupancy rate will cross 90%, he adds. Early last year, BlackRock sold the 50-storey AXA Tower in Tanjong Pagar to a consortium led by Perennial Real Estate Holdings for $1.18 billion, which translated to $1,750 psf based on the net lettable area of nearly 675,000 sq ft. Were still interested in Singapore, says Saunders. The irony is that because of the timing of our funds, we are sometimes a buyer and a seller at the same time. In Singapore, BlackRock is still keen to invest in office buildings in the CBD, as well as suburban retail space, as these assets tend to be more resilient, he adds. Saunders: The irony is that because of the timing of our funds, we aresometimes a buyer and a seller at thesame time Source: BlackRock Record office deals in the makingOn June 1, MYP, a Singapore Exchange listed investment holding company controlled by the family of Indonesian magnate and philanthropist Tahir, announced that he had signed a deal to acquire the 28-storey Straits Trading Building on Battery Road for $560 million. The seller is Sun Venture Group, which had acquired the building for $450 million at end-2014. Tahirs acquisition price translates to a record-smashing $3,520 psf for the building, which has a net lettable area (NLA) of 158,897 sq ft. Its a 999-year leasehold building, and thats pretty hard to come by in Raffles Place, says Jeremy Lake, executive director of investment properties at CBRE. The price psf has even surpassed the previous record of $3,125 psf for the purchase of 71 Robinson Road at the peak of the market in April 2008 by Germanys Commerz Real, a subsidiary of Commerzbank. CapitaLand Commercial Trust (CCT) announced on May 23 that it was acquiring 60% of the Capita- Green office tower that it does not already own. The stake amounts to $393 million. The acquisition price is based on CapitaGreens market value of $1.6 billion, or $2,276 psf. The 40-storey, Grade-A office tower is located on Market Street in the CBD and has a total NLA of 704,000 sq ft. Straits Trading Building was recently acquired by Indonesian business magnate Tahir for $560 million through his family-controlled, SGX-listed entity MYP Just the three deals alone Asia Square, CapitaGreen and Straits Trading Building will bring the total office investment sales for 2Q2016 to $4.35 billion, according to CBRE Research. That excludes two significant strata office deals done in the quarter as well: the sale of the entire 13th floor of 6 Raffles Quay for $28 million ($2,764 psf); and the sale of the 13th floor of Tong Building for $25.5 million ($3,713 psf). If both deals were included, total office investment deals from April to June would amount to $4.4 billion, says CBRE Resarch, making it a record quarter. It is a far cry from 1Q2016, in which the sole office investment transaction was the sale of the remaining 50% stake in 78 Shenton Way to Alpha Investment Partners (AIP) for $301.5 million. The purchase of the stake valued the property at $603 million, or $1,665 psf, based on the NLA of 362,199 sq ft. The seller of the remaining 50% stake was Commerz Real, and the deal was brokered by CBRE. The 50% stake in Capital Square that was put up for sale last April for $2,800 psf could be on the market again CapitaLand Commercial Trust paid $393 million for the remaining 60% in the 43-storey CapitaGreen that it did not already own Gradual improvement in sentimentAfter a dearth of deals in 1Q2016, there has been a flurry in just the past month. With the sale of Capita- Green, Straits Trading Building and now Asia Square, we have the ingredients for gradual improvement in sentiment, says CBREs Lake. These will provide data points for investors who perhaps thus far have chosen to watch and wait. The two major office buildings said to be injecting 2.77 million sq ft of new Grade-A office space into the CBD when they are completed in 2H2016 and early next year are GuocoTower (890,000 sq ft) and Marina One (1.88 million sq ft) respectively. Leasing activity in these two new office schemes have picked up in recent months. For example, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ is said to be moving to Marina One and taking up 140,000 sq ft of space, and Daiwa Capital Markets is expected to move into GuocoTower, according to Douglas Dunkerley, group managing director of Corporate Locations in his recent report. As the number of tenants signing up in these new developments increases, there will be more confidence about the markets ability to absorb the volume of new supply, adds CBBREs Lake. Rents will bottom a bit earlier than expected, and investors will conclude that the market is not so bad after all. Lake: With the sale of CapitaGreen, Straits Trading Building and now AsiaSquare, we have the ingredients forgradual improvement in sentiment Stoking the flamesSome office buildings that were put up for sale last year and lapsed could soon be revived. Some investors may now bring forward their decision to buy instead of postponing it, says Lake. For instance, Tower 15 on Hoe Chiang Road was launched for sale last November at $475 million, with CBRE as the marketing agent. The 29-storey tower contains a mix of offices and a hotel, with a three-storey annex podium. The building has an NLA of 210,268 sq ft and sits on a 39,337 sq ft freehold site. The site can also be redeveloped into a new 30-storey strata commercial development with a mix of retail and office space. Tower 15 on Hoe Chiang Road, which was put up for sale last November at $475 million, is still on the market Another building that could be on the market again is 77 Robinson Road, which was put up for sale last September through sole agent DTZ. The 35-storey office building in the CBD has an NLA of 293,818 sq ft, including 6,018 sq ft of retail space and 180 parking spaces. The 99-year leasehold building has a lease dating from 1989. The price tag then was $650 million or $2,200 psf based on NLA. The building was last put up for sale in June 2011 by Colliers International as the marketing agent. The building at 77 Robinson Road is held by German fund SEB ImmoInvest and was acquired in April 2007 for $526 million ($1,783 psf). The fund is managed by SEB Asset Management, which was acquired by Cordea Savills early last year. The entity has since been rebranded Savills Investment Management. As the fund has to be liquidated according to guidelines of the German regulatory authority BaFin, Savills Investment Management hopes to be third time lucky with the sale of 77 Robinson Road. It is said to have appointed CBRE as the marketing agent. In April last year, AIP put its 50% stake in Capital Square up for sale. The 16-storey office building in the CBD has a total NLA of 388,215 sq ft and was completed in 1998. It has 80 years left on its lease. The indicative price last year was $2,800 psf, which valued the building at $1.09 billion, or $543.5 million for a 50% stake. JLL and CBRE are joint marketing agents for the property, which is still up for sale. The office tower at 77 Robinson Road was put on the market last year and could be put up for sale again later this year Short-term challengesBut the office market continues to face challenges in the short term, owing to weak business conditions, cautions Cushman & Wakefields Li. She says, Leasing demand continues to be affected by headwinds in the banking, oil and commodities sectors. Li projects that Grade-A CBD rents could moderate a further 10% to 12% in 2016, but stabilise in subsequent years, given the significantly reduced supply pipeline in 2017 and 2018. Local and global investors who are looking at Singapore are adopting a long-term view, says JLLs Hyland. They are not looking backwards over the last few quarters or to the next quarter, he adds. They are taking a five- to 10-year bet on Singapore. This article appeared in the City & Country, Issue 732 (June 13, 2016) of The Edge Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Another landed property in District 15, a terraced house on Terang Bulan Avenue, fetched a profit of $1.2 million on May 19. The freehold property with a land area of 1,572 sq ft was purchased in 2009 at $1.1 million ($686 psf on land area) and sold last month at $2.3 million ($1,474 psf). The annualised gain works out to 12%. A semi-detached house on Crescent Road was sold at a $3.3 million profit In the non-landed segment, four properties in District 15 were sold at a profit exceeding one million each. The first property was a 3,703 sq ft penthouse at Vertis which netted a $1.2 million profit, or an annualised gain of 4%. The seller had purchased the unit from the developer in May 2006 for $2.5 million ($673 psf) and sold it last month for $3.7 million ($999 psf). Vertis is a freehold apartment development comprising 42 units near Mountbatten road. Separately, a 1,475 sq ft condo unit at The Esta was sold for a profit of $1.1 million, or an annualised gain of 7%. The property had also been held for 10 years by the seller, who bought the unit from the developer in January 2006 for $1.1 million ($734 psf). He sold it last month for $2.2 million ($1,458 psf). Over at One Amber, a 1,701 sq ft high-floor unit fetched a $1.1 million profit. The seller had purchased the unit in a sub-sale in June 2009 for $1.4 million ($850 psf) and sold it last month for $2.5 million ($1,470 psf). This translates into an annualised gain of 8%. Both The Esta and One Amber are freehold condo developments in District 15. On the other hand, one property in District 15 was put up for a mortgagee sale. The seller of the 2,551 sq ft, four-bedroom unit at Silversea incurred a loss of $882,000. He had bought the unit for $4.8 million ($1,875 psf) from the developer in February 2012. The home went under the hammer for $3.9 million ($1,529 psf) in April. Outside District 15, one property was flipped after being held for just two years. However, it fetched a profit of $2.1 million despite incurring an 8% Sellers Stamp Duty, or $670,400. The property, a semi-detached house which sits on a 4,112 sq ft freehold site on Merryn Avenue in District 11, was purchased for $6.3 million ($1,528 psf) in March 2014 and sold for $8.4 million ($2,039 psf) last month.

At Watertown, a 1,216 sq ft, three-bedroom unit was sold in a sub-sale on June 8 for $1.39 million, or $1,141 psf. The price was lower than what the seller had paid the developer in 2012 $1.41 million, or $1,157 psf. The transaction, therefore, resulted in a loss of about $19,000. The sellers stamp duty (SSD) was not applicable in this case as the holding period had just crossed four years. There have been 16 sub-sale caveats at the 992- unit project so far, but we can only trace the previous caveats for 10 of them. Including SSD, six of the 10 sellers incurred losses ranging from $19,000 to $246,000. On the other hand, four sellers reaped profits ranging from $34,000 to $191,000. In contrast, two sellers at nearby A Treasure Trove made profits exceeding $100,000 in June. The two units sold had been held for less than five years. They fetched $1,020 and $1,081 psf respectively, a tad lower than the Watertown unit. However, the sellers had paid $876 and $920 psf for their units, which they bought direct from the developer in October 2011. Two sellers at A Treasure Trove reaped profits while a seller at Watertown incurred a loss in June There have been 67 sub-sale transactions at the 882-unit A Treasure Trove, but we can only trace the previous caveats for 61 of them. All 61 subsale transactions were profitable, with the gains averaging $146,000. If SSD is included, one deal was in the red. A Treasure Trove was launched in September 2011 and 683 units were sold at a median price of $915 psf. Watertown was launched in January 2012 and 770 units were sold at a median price of $1,169 psf. Watertown is part of a mixed development comprising Waterway Point, a suburban mall with a net lettable area of 370,824 sq ft. It is connected to the Punggol MRT station. A Treasure Trove is located within walking distance of the Punggol MRT station. In another part of District 19, a 1,496 sq ft low-floor unit at Kovan Residences was sold at 2011 prices, or $989 psf. Kovan Residences is a 99- year leasehold 521-unit condominium located beside the Kovan MRT station. In the Core Central Region, an 861 sq ft high-floor unit at The Sail @ Marina Bay was sold for a price that is on a par with 2008 levels, or $1,661 psf. In July 2008, an 861 sq ft unit directly two floors below found a buyer at $1,626 psf.

Designed by WOHA Architects and developed by Far East Organization, the mixed-use commercial development obtained its temporary occupation permit in December 2015. We wanted to design a building that is distinctive and elegant, says Phua Hong Wei, associate at WOHA. It wasnt purely an ego trip. Far East Organization won the site located at the corner of Gopeng Street and Peck Seah Street in a government land tender in January 2011 with a bid of $194.77 million ($932 psf per plot ratio). WOHA was roped in to design the tower at the tender stage. We remained true to the essence of the original concept and design, says Phua. The distinctive red, 27-storey Oasia Hotel Downtown designed by WOHA was completed last December Site challenges One of the challenges for the architect was the size of the site, which measured just 50m by 50m, or about 2,300 sq m. Besides the small footprint, the site was also hemmed in by surrounding buildings, says Phua. Its similar to New York, where buildings have limited views. So, we carved out internal spaces as sky terraces to create views. Another challenge was designing three distinct zones within the tower loft offices, hotel rooms and club floors. WOHAs solution was to design three L-shaped blocks stacked on top of each other and rotated in different directions so they have different views depending on their orientation. Each zone has its own sky terrace and amenities floor. For the office suites, the sky terrace is on the sixth floor, which is also where the meeting rooms, dining pods, swimming pool, aqua gym and gym are located. The hotel reception, lounge, lawn, swimming pool and other facilities are located on the 12th floor. For the club floors on the upper levels, there is a reception lobby, swimming pools and other facilities on the 21st floor, exclusively for guests in the club rooms. The roof terrace on the 27th floor has a swimming pool that opens up to the sky and a restaurant that the public can access. The swimming pool for club room guests on the 21st floor The main lobby on the ground floor with The Marmalade Pantry The Cin-Cin wine bar and restaurant on the ground floor The sky pavilion on the club floor. Source: Far East Organization The main lobby on the ground floor has a lounge area and two F&B outlets, namely The Marmalade Pantry and the Cin-Cin wine bar and restaurant, which are open to the public. The office component, namely PS100, has its own entrance lobby on the ground floor as well. The 314-room Oasia Hotel Downtown spans the 12th to 27th floors of the tower and includes 88 club rooms. PS100 is on the 7th to 11th floors. It comprises 100 loft-style offices, with unit sizes ranging from 420 to 520 sq ft and a ceiling height of 5m. These offices are furnished with bathroom and kitchenette. When they were released in March 2012, demand was so overwhelming that all the units were snapped up in the first weekend of the launch. The average price of the 99-year leasehold units was $3,000 psf. About 60% of the buyers of the loft offices were said to be Singaporeans and permanent residents, while corporate buyers accounted for another 20%. The buyers represented a wide spectrum of businesses, such as shipping/ logistics, investment, trading, business consultancy and professional services. Recent transaction prices were at an average of $3,160 psf for a bulk purchase of units on the 10th floor last December and $3,194 psf for a 517 sq ft unit on the seventh floor that was sold in March for $1.65 million, according to caveats lodged with URA Realis. The average rent achieved from January to June were $5.34 psf a month, according to URA data. Faade The exterior of the building is enveloped with expanded aluminium mesh polycoated in five shades of red, including orange, rust and salmon pink. From afar, depending on the light, it looks like a reddish or pinkish sculpture, says Lee Shee Koeng, executive director of the property services division at Far East Organization. But up-close, you will see that its made of panels of various shades, like the tiny pixels of a television screen. A lot of attention has also been given to the landscaping, with 21 species of flowering plants and vines planted on the apron of the building. The species were selected based on their adaptability to the sun and the shade conditions of the building at various times of the day. Over time, as the greenery grows and the creepers start to climb upwards, the building will look like a red flower set among green foliage, says WOHAs Phua. By having plants growing on the exterior of the building, occupants inside the tower will be able to enjoy a view of the greenery when they look out, says Far East Organizations Lee. Typically, when youre in an office building in the CBD, youre either staring at a neighbouring office building, someones workplace or a distant view of the sea, depending on which floor youre on. Beyond aesthetics, the external layer of aluminium mesh with its green covering helps reduce heat absorption, explains Lee. Its a more sustainable and natural approach. Far East Organizations Lee (left) and WOHAs Phua Lifestyle elements A lot of thought has been put into the lifestyle elements, especially in the interiors designed by Spanish architect and designer Patricia Urquiola. In keeping with the nature theme, earth tones were used. For instance, copper interior walls, timber lattice panelling and patterned tiles designed by Urquiola were used in the common areas as well as the individual hotel rooms. The development is designed as an urban oasis a retreat within the city, says Lee. It is also about creating a holistic experience, notes WOHAs Phua. When hotel guests arrive at the main lobby, they will be whisked up to the reception lobby on the 12th floor, which opens out to a sky terrace. Being in an elevated space within the heart of the CBD and yet theres natural light, fresh air and plenty of greenery thats what sets this building apart, he says.

It was love at first sight when Chong Yoke Chye, 58, and his family of four eyed the ample sporting facilities and lush landscaped grounds ofThe Interlace, a condominium along Depot Road. I go jogging a lot, and so do my kids, says the father of three boys aged 25 to 31. The 1-kilometre jogging track, which skirts the borders of the sprawling 8-hectare site and connects its various courtyards and gardens, was therefore the most attractive feature. 50m lap pool at the Water Park Courtyard and the state-of-the-art gym were a close second. The Chong family, who toured the development almost immediately after it was completed and handed over to residents in late 2013, was keen on The Interlaces other recreational facilities, such as the BBQ promenade, karaoke rooms and theatrettes. Yoke Chyes sons were also particularly fond of the Spa Valley Courtyard, which houses the massage pool, spa pool lagoon, Jacuzzi and Waterfall Grotto. The Spa Valley Courtyard is just one of eight themed courtyards interspersed throughout the property. It was love at first sight when Chong Yoke Chye and his sons toured the ample sporting facilities and lush landscaped grounds ofThe Interlace GENEROUS UNITS So the decision to settle down in a three-bedroom unit was made very quickly. That the units were generously proportioned was a plus considering how small the units in newer condominiums in the downtown core tend to be but not a main consideration. The units here are all pretty big but because my children are grown up, we thought we would get one that was just the right size for us, says Yoke Chye, a shipping manager who is planning to retire soon. His sons Shao Ming, 31 and Shao Soon, 28, are both engineers, while Shao Siong, 25, is a recent graduate looking for employment in the banking/finance sector. The Chongs were among the first to buy their home soon after the projects Temporary Occupation Permit in 2013. They chose a 1,260 sq ft three-bedder. One of the main characteristics of the development that attracted them was the spacious layout of the units with most units ranging in size from 1,873 sq ft for a three-bedder to 6,308 sq ft for a luxurious penthouse with private roof terrace. Many of the units come with private enclosed spaces or even private roof terraces. Youngest son and recent graduate Shao Siong in his bedroom-cum-study Second son Shao Soon in the family room of the spacious three-bedroom unit A VERTICAL VILLAGE Of course, the most distinctive feature ofThe Interlacehas to be its unique architecture, designed by world renowned architect OMA/Ole Scheeren, and developed by a consortium led by CapitaLand. Thirty-one apartment blocks, each six storeys in height, are stacked in a hexagonal configuration and laid out around the eight courtyards. The interlocking blocks create a series of stepped volumes, some partly resting, others partly floating, like a vertical village. The sum effect is one of an interlaced structure from which the development gets its name that weaves individual apartments into the fabric of an inclusive community. Because of this design, the developments 1,040 units come in various configurations and facings. I wanted something thats very quiet and peaceful, says Yoke Chye. Of the apartment he picked, he says: This, to me, is a perfect unit. You can see the AYE but youre not so close to it that you can hear the traffic. And the height (on the ninth floor) is just right. The family moved into their new home atThe Interlacefive weeks after they received their keys and did a simple renovation. Among the more interesting fittings that Yoke Chye chose are pendant lights that resemble The Interlaces stepped architecture. We bought the unit without knowing much about the architect. But after that, I did some research and learned that the architect designed a lot of well-known buildings, he says, referring to the China Central Television (CCTV) Headquarters in Beijing, the MahaNakhon in Bangkok, as well as the Prada Epicenters in New York and Los Angeles. The Interlaceis famous in its own right, too, having won multiple awards, such as Best Architecture at the 2010 Asia Pacific Property Awards and World Building of the Year at the 2015 World Architecture Festival, affectionately dubbed The Architectural Oscars. What the Chong family likes is the spaciousness of the 8-hectare site atThe Interlace, with its lush tropical foliage GREENERY EVERYWHERE Thanks to the way the apartment blocks are stacked, the number of horizontal surfaces supporting roof gardens and landscaped terraces could be maximised. These extend the outdoor space on multiple levels, providing views above the tree line to the surrounding courtyards, the Central Business District and the Straits of Singapore beyond. In total, these provide green areas that equate to 112% of the development site area. Theres greenery everywhere, says Yoke Chye. I also appreciate the spaciousness of the property. I dont think you can find a condominium of this size thats so close to the city. The 8-hectare site, with its towers abundant in lush tropical foliage, reinforces the idea of a vertical village embedded in nature. LOCATION, LOCATION Besides the proximity to the city, Yoke Chye who has been a city dweller all his life also appreciates The Interlaces immediate vicinity, especially since it is nestled within a green belt. The location is superb, he says. Within 20 minutes of walking, youll hit Kent Ridge Park, HortPark, Labrador Nature Reserve and Mount Faber Park. On weekends, when he has more leisure time, Yoke Chye will take the free shuttle bus fromThe Interlaceto VivoCity. From there, he will take the Marang trail to Mount Faber Park, jog all the way to Kent Ridge Park, and then take the train from Kent Ridge MRT station home. Its a total distance of 9.3 km, with two treetop walks and scenic trails along the way, he adds. When the avid jogger is pressed for time, he will work out at the gym and run five laps around the 1km track. I start running at 10.30pm and the jogging track is very well-lit. Its really like running in a park, says Yoke Chye. His sons go for runs on their own as well, and occasionally get together with the neighbours for bouts of street soccer. And when it comes to family bonding time, the Chongs love nothing better than to enjoy one anothers company over BBQ at one of the barbeque pavilions.

These shareholders will have to hold at least 75 per cent of the value of SMRT shares held by all shareholders present at the meeting.The scheme of arrangement offers more certainty to a potential buyer, who will get all or none of the company. The more common general offer route does not guarantee a 100 per cent stake even if the buyer gains majority control.Temasek now owns 54 per cent of SMRT, which has been listed on the SGX since July 2000 and has a market capitalisation of close to $2.4 billion.Once the acquisition is completed, SMRT will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Temasek and will be delisted from the Singapore Exchange (SGX).Last Friday (July 15), the Transport Ministry said that the Land Transport Authority will take over all operating assets of the North-South, East-West and Circle lines as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT Line, from SMRT for $1.06 billion. This is the the net book value - or current value - of the assets, plus GST.In turn, SMRT will run the trains on these lines and retain a share of the earnings. But it will have to pay a licence fee to LTA annually, which will vary according to SMRT's profitability.SMRT chairman Koh Yong Guan noted that SMRT will continue to face significant risks over operating costs as it grapples with an ageing and expanded rail network, while having to deliver higher rail reliability and service under the requirements of the new rail financing framework.\"Taking the company private will allow SMRT to better fulfil its role as a public transport operator without the pressure of short-term market expectations. It will also allow SMRT to be better supported as it retools and reinforces its core skillsets in engineering and maintenance,\" he said.Temasek said it agrees with SMRT that there will be no special dividend arising from asset sale to LTA under the new rail financing framework.\"Net proceeds received will substantially be used to pay part of its debt of $762 million as at 30 September 2016, and to support re-investment needs of SMRT,\" the two said in a joint statement on Wednesday (July 20).\"We are proposing to move SMRT to private ownership so we can more closely collaborate with the company on system-level transformation, including its transition to the new regulatory environment without the distraction of being a listed company,\" Temasek International president Chia Song Hwee said.\"We will have greater flexibility to work with SMRT as a private entity to seek sustainable long-term solutions as part of its transition.\"Last year, Singapore's overall rail network achieved 133,000 train-km between breakdowns.However, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan has said he wants Singapore's rail network to achieve Taipei's standard or reliability.Taipei's metro network is the top in the world by this measure, with 800,000 train-km between disruptions - six times more than Singapore's.Last year, Singapore's overall rail network had 29 major disruptions lasting more than half an hour each. Hong Kong's MTR, in contrast, had only eight.Senior lecturer Park Byung Joon from SIM University said that should SMRT become fully owned by Temasek it would not count as nationalisation.Dr Park said that for nationalisation to occur, rail operators must be fully owned and answerable to the Government - such as in Seoul, Korea - and this will not be the case for SMRT."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) and German-born architect Ole Scheeren were the lead designers of the 1,040-unit condominium, which was developed by a CapitaLand-led consortium. For those who are less acquainted with architecture awards, WAF is dubbed the Oscars of the architectural world and the awards are the crme-de-la-crme of the architecture accolades. Every year since 2008, architects from across the globe would enter their projects into one or more of the over 30 building categories in the WAF ranging from Civic & Community to Sport and Transport to compete for a spot in the final. The Interlacewas shortlisted as a finalist in the WAF 2015, along with 337 other developments. Architects for the shortlisted projects must personally pitch their submission to a panel of international judges, who would critique and challenge them. The intense two-day process took place in front of a live audience to facilitate an exchange of ideas and ensure transparency. Judges have been appointed based on stringent criteria including outstanding reputation as an architect or allied professional, expertise in a particular development, geographical origin to ensure a balanced representation, and from among previous winners of the WAF awards. A TRAILBLAZER The Interlacewas first named winner in the Completed Buildings-Housing category. It then vied with 16 other category winners for the World Building of the Year title. To win, projects must push boundaries in both forms and functions. They must also be deeply-rooted in the communities that they serve. Essentially, they must exemplify the future of cities and architecture. The Interlacewas lauded as a trailblazer for its bold design, which features 31 interlocking blocks, conceived as a vertical village. The blocks are arranged in hexagonal grids to allow for generous distance between each home and maximum privacy, while the interlocking design connects the residents together to foster social cohesion. Cities are dominated by tower blocks which create isolation. With The Interlace, I wanted to create a new type of living that was about connectivity, about a sense of community rather than individuality and isolation, says Scheeren. Scheeren arranged the blocks in hexagonal grids to allow for generous distance between each home and maximum privacy. Because of the sites natural elevation, the blocks do not face each other and residents enjoy unobstructed views. At the same time, the interlocking design connects the residents together which fosters social cohesion. The buildings envelope eight outdoor courtyards Central Square, Water Park, Play Hills, Spa Valley, Theatre Plaza, Bamboo Garden, Lotus Pond and Waterfall Terrace providing shades, making them usable for communal and personal activities all day long.

The criss-crossing blocks create pockets of spaces, forcing wind to travel through them and increasing their speed. This results in a wind tunnel effect which makes the development cool and windy all year round. Scheeren also placed water bodies along the wind corridors and made use of the water vapour to further cool the development and enhance the quality of living of the residents. Greenery, such as sky gardens and planted terraces, is incorporated in multiple locations throughout the buildings. Together with the lush tropical foliage on the ground, The Interlace has green spaces that covers 112% of the development site area. As a result, there is more nature on the site than before it was built, says Scheeren. After the live judging,The Interlacewas named winner of the World Building of The Year title. Internationally acclaimed architect Sir Peter Cook, who led the judging in WAF 2015, was quoted by CNN saying, The Interlace makes a major urban statement. It gives you a horizontal city with the interweaving of space and vegetation. Its a game-changer. Play hills - one of the eight outdoor courtyards at The Interlace AN UNCONVENTIONAL SITE The Interlacestands on a site that is unique in many ways, which poses a rare opportunity to create a bespoke development. For one, the site is elevated on a sloping hill and nestled within a 10km stretch of greenery, the Southern Ridges. It is also in a prime location which is a mere 10-minute drive from the Central Business District and 15 minutes from the Orchard Road shopping belt. To develop the site to its full potential, CapitaLand chose to partner with Scheeren who has made global statement through his unconventional and stunning architecture including the China Central Television (CCTV) Headquarters in Beijing and MahaNakhon, a mixed-use development in Bangkok. Ole Scheeren, one of the lead designers atThe Interlace, is also behind other iconic buildings such as the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing. Although Scheeren is celebrated for his iconic, even provocative design, he thinks of architecture as the stories of the people who live or work in the building. Scheeren also defines great architecture as one that creates positive experiences for its residents. Scheeren says it was a special moment for him to walk throughThe Interlaceas a completed project for the first time and to discover the incredible richness of its space, dramatic sceneries and diverse atmospheres. What made me happiest was the sense of lightness and freedom that I felt in this place a lightness of an open, permeable construct of fluid spaces and courtyards, of floating building volumes, of tropical landscapes and gardens, and a freedom to choose between so many different moods and emotional environments, he concedes. This years WAF counts Scheeren as one of the acclaimed judges, along with other heavyweights including David Chipperfield and Kai-Uwe Bergmann. More than 300 finalists will be vying for the 2016s coveted World Building of the Year title.

The project was lauded as a trailblazer for its bold, yet community-centric design, as well as its top-notch green features. Here are 10 things about The Interlace, that make it a one-of-a-kind development, well-deserving its world-class status and prominence. 1. UNPARALLELED LOCATION The Interlacejourney began in 2007 when a CapitaLand-led consortium acquired the site through a collective sale. Formerly known as Gillman Heights Condominium, the sites outstanding attributes presented a unique opportunity to create a bespoke development. The site sits atop a hill in a private enclave nestled within a 10-kilometre stretch of unspoiled greenery, the Southern Ridges. At the same time, it is a mere 10-minute drive to prominent nodes including the Central Business District, Buona Vista growth corridor, HarbourFront office and retail belts, National University of Singapore and Sentosa. To realise the sites full potential, the developers partnered Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) and internationally acclaimed architect Ole Scheeren who is renowned for his bold, sometimes provocative designs as seen in his project repertoire including the China Central Television Headquarters in Beijing and the floating auditorium on Nai Pi Lae Lagoon in Thailand. The Interlacesits atop a hill in a private enclave nestled within a 10-kilometre stretch of unspoiled greenery, the Southern Ridges. 2. A HILLSIDE VILLAGE As in other major cities, plain-vanilla buildings dominate the Singapore skyline for practical reasons.The Interlacecould have been built as 12 isolated towers. However, Scheeren wanted to break the status quo and took a radical approach to topple the towers, making the vertical, horizontal. Taking a leaf from the hillside villages of Santorini in Greece, Liguria in Italy and Al Hajjara in Yemen, OMA/Scheeren unveiled their formal design for The Interlace on September 4, 2009, which featured 31 interlocking super blocks, stacked on top of one another in a dramatic form. 3. LUXURY OF SPACE Home sizes have shrunk over the years as land becomes increasingly scarce and expensive. Space is the ultimate luxury in a small city-state such as Singapore. Against this backdrop, each unit at The Interlace was designed to be unusually generous and efficient. Available three-bedroom-with-family units start from 2,056 sq ft while penthouses range from 3,488 to 6,308 sq ft. In a similar vein, Scheeren arranged the blocks in hexagonal grids which allow for generous distance between each home and maximum privacy. The sites natural elevation also allows more units to enjoy unobstructed views. On the other hand, the interlocking design connects the residents together and nurtures a community spirit. The Interlaceis also built on an 8-hectare site, which affords every resident a much-needed breathing space. Space is the ultimate luxury in a small city-state like Singapore.The Interlaceunits are designed to be unusually generous and efficient. 4. WIND-TUNNEL EFFECT The criss-crossing blocks atThe Interlacecreate a permeable faade and pockets of space, forcing winds to travel through them and increasing their speed. The process results in natural air-conditioning, making the development cool and windy all year round. Scheeren also strategically placed water bodies along the wind corridors to further cool the development and enhance the quality of living at The Interlace. The criss-crossing blocks create pockets of space, forcing winds to travel through them. This results in natural air-conditioning effect. 5. ENGINEERING MARVEL Each super block atThe Interlaceis supported by weight-bearing transfer decks that are capable of withstanding the weight of 10 Airbus A380 jetliners. This allows the super blocks to be safely stacked and criss-crossed on top of each other. These decks were constructed from High Performance Grade 80 concrete. The usual concrete grade used for buildings in Singapore range from 50 to 60. The strong support structures mean doing away with unsightly support pillars and freeing up floor space to create a bigger living area. 6. 112% GREENERY The Interlaceis home to more than 170 species of flora, comprising about 1,200 trees, 14 super trees and 700 plants. Greenery was incorporated in multiple locations throughout the buildings, in the form of sky gardens and planted terraces as well as hanging off the vertical faade. Together with the lush tropical foliage on the ground, The Interlace has green spaces that cover 112% of the development site area. As a result, there is more greenery on the site than before the project was built. 7. QUIET ZONES The buildings envelope 8 outdoor courtyards and provide shade, making them usable for communal and personal activities all day long. Of the courtyards, the Spa Valley, the Bamboo Garden and the Lotus Pond courtyards form the quiet zones that are ideal for meditation and contemplation. The Spa Valley courtyard features a spa pool lagoon, Jacuzzi, waterfall grotto, massage pools and steam rooms, in a rainforest setting. Spa Valley - one of the 8 outdoor courtyards atThe Interlace- nestled in a rainforest setting 8. ACTIVE ZONES The other courtyards Central Square, Water Park, Play Hills, Theatre Plaza and Waterfall Terrace provide generous communal and interactive space for the residents of 30 different nationalities who call The Interlace their home. The Central Square courtyard is a favourite meeting spot for family, friends and neighbours, with its proximity to the recreational facilities including gymnasium, billiards room and karaoke room. Budding athletes and sports enthusiasts can head to the Water Park and Waterfall Terrace courtyards which house a 50-metre lap pool, tennis courts and other facilities. Children can nurture friendships from a young age at the Play Hills courtyard, which features sculpted groundswells and a play station, while their furry friends can stretch their legs at the pet zone. 9. SHOP AND DINE The Interlacehouses 8 retail outlets, including a mini mart, a bakery, a coffee joint and a nail spa, which offer daily necessities and services. There is also a shuttle service from The Interlace to the HarbourFront MRT station which is the transit node for VivoCity and Sentosa. Other lifestyle destinations in the vicinity include Alexandra Village Food Centre and ABC Brickworks Market & Food Centre, known for their local delicacies, as well as Anchorpoint Shopping Centre, Queensway Shopping Centre and IKEA. 10. RUNNING TRACK One of the unique features atThe Interlaceis the 1-kilometre running track, which borders its sprawling 8-hectare site. The track connects the various courtyards and gardens in the development, and serves as fire access to all 23 lift cores within the project. The track is well-lit into the night, making it accessible for avid joggers and time-strapped residents at their convenience.

And it is not just technology companies that are jumping on the bandwagon, but also property developers who see the opportunity in providing the properties to host these data centres. Keppel launched the first data centre real estate investment trust in the country called Keppel DC REIT, which was listed on the Singapore Exchange in December 2014. US-based data centre REIT Digital Realty may be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but it also owns three properties in Singapore that will house data centres. Other players are also getting into the act. For example, Ho Lee Construction, Evia Real Estate and their partners entered the data centre hosting business five years ago when they jointly purchased the former Seagate Technology building at 7000 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 for $91.5 million. They spent another $10 million retrofitting the one million sq ft building to turn it into an ideal environment for hosting data centres. The property has another 41 years left on its original 60-year lease. Michael Tan, executive director of Ho Lee Construction, realises the potential for hosting data centres. In the past, we used to share one photo, but now with WhatsApp, Viber and Instagram, we can share photos and videos hundred times over, he explains. This means there is a need for more remote data storage space. Ho Lee Construction and its partners bought the former Seagate factory for $91 million Opportunity The first data centre operator to enter the newly refurbished space at the premises on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 was US-based data centre co-location operator IO, which took up 177,000 sq ft. IO started operations in Singapore in 2013 after it invested more than $30 million in the 177,000 sq ft data centre facility, and spent another $5 million to enhance the security around the building premises. Security is an important issue as IOs clients include MNCs such as Allianz, Goldman Sachs and LexisNexis. The clients of data centre operators, especially MNCs, will want to lock in their leases with the operator for at least five to 10 years, with some even up to 15 years, says Tom Duncan, CBREs executive director on data centres. Meanwhile, the data centre operators, such as IO, tend to lock in their leases for at least 30 years, says Tan. Therefore, this makes data centre hosting facilities attractive as an investment, given the stability of rental income. Gross rental yields tend to be lower at 5% to 6%, compared with the 7% to 8% yield for warehouse or factory space. However, the catch is that leases for warehouse and factory space tend to be shorter, with a typical warehouse lease averaging two to three years, and factory space five to seven years, he adds. Besides IO, other companies that have located their data centres within the building on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 include Singapore Power and listed property group Wing Tai Holdings. Wing Tai has even taken up some space in the building to store its retail merchandise. Only 20% of the one million sq ft space in the building is dedicated to hosting data centres. Another 60% of the space has been leased to other tenants such as Seagate, which continues to have a presence there; mobile phone camera lens maker Heptogen; and Evias Business Continuity Planning, a disaster recovery business. So far, the building has an occupancy rate of 80%, with annual rents of $20 million, of which data centre hosting constitutes 20% to 25%, or $4 million to $5 million. Based on the purchase price and renovations, the total cost of the building amounted to about $100 million. This means that net yield on the investment is about 15%, reckons Tan. Tan: We are hoping to sell the building to someone who has the expertise, track record and capability to attract more data centre operators to locate their facilities here Market size Total data centre co-location market revenue in Singapore is said to have grown 13% from US$963 million in 2014 to US$1.09 billion in 2015. It is projected to grow another 16% to US$1.26 billion ($1.69 billion) in 2016, according to the latest annual report on data centre supply released by Canada-based Structure Research in October 2015. According to Structured Research, there are 36 data centres in the East, with the two largest clusters in the Tai Seng/Ubi area comprising 11 facilities and the Chai Chee area with another six. In the West, there are 18 facilities, with the two largest clusters of seven data centres each at the International Business Park and in the Ayer Rajah/Science Park area. There are another three in Woodlands and one in the Yishun area. Combined, these co-location data centres occupy about two million sq ft of industrial space in 2014. According to CBRE Research, co-location data centres in Singapore increased from two million sq ft to three million sq ft in 2015. It is projected to grow to 4.8 million sq ft this year, and six million sq ft by 2017. Are data centres the answer to oversupply in industrial space? The departure of some of the more labour-intensive manufacturing companies to lower-cost locations such as Malaysia, Indonesia and China has left an increasing number of industrial buildings and warehouses either unused or underutilised. The question is whether some of these industrial buildings and warehouses can be converted into data centres to meet the growing demand. According to Christine Li, head of research at Cushman & Wakefield, not all factory or warehouse buildings can be converted for use by data centres. She sees a mismatch in terms of the quality of the buildings, such as the floor-to-ceiling height, floor loading factors and even floor layout. Some of these buildings are located in heavy industrial areas, which may not be ideal for data centre use, she adds. It worked five years ago when data centres were first set up in Singapore because they needed to start operations in the shortest possible time. Most of the older buildings do not have efficient space use, and it may be too costly for the owners to demolish and rebuild, observes Li. This does not preclude some data centre operators from setting up shop in refurbished old warehouses or industrial buildings. For example, Digital Realtys latest 177,000 sq ft, four-storey co-location data centre in the Loyang area used to be a warehouse. Digital Realty spent $200 million to rebuild half the building to maximise the gross floor area and install high-power cables, chilling units, unlimited power supply (UPS) backup power, standby generators, internet connection and security features.

It took us about 12 months to rebuild and refurbish this building compared to between 18 and 24 months to construct our facility in Jurong from ground up, says Omer Wilson, Digital Realtys marketing director for Asia-Pacific. Digital Realtys first facility, in Jurong, is a 370,000 sq ft building, while its third and upcoming facility is in Loyang. The new facility will also be a 370,000 sq ft, purpose-built data centre facility. Land cost is obviously at a premium here, says Wilson. It is getting harder to find land that is cost-effective to build on. We will be increasingly moving towards building conversions or buying existing data centre operators that own their premises to gain access to their assets. Wilson: It took us about 12 months to rebuild and refurbish this building compared to between 18 and 24 months to construct our facility in Jurong from ground up In fact, Ho Lee and its consortium partners now see this as an opportune time to cash out. The group has already put their building on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 on the market. The indicative price tag is upwards of $250 million, or $300 psf of net lettable area. Why are they divesting now? We are hoping to sell the building to someone who has the expertise, track record and capability to attract more data centre operators to locate their facilities in the building in order to realise the buildings potential over the long term, says Ho Lees Tan.

The company that held the franchise in Singapore, Hersing Corp, sold the franchise together with Asia-Pacific brokerage firm ERA Real Estate for over $100 million in 2013. The buyer is Singapore-based private equity firm Northstar Group. While ERA has grown to become the biggest real estate agency in Singapore with 6,375 agents and over 40% market share in terms of new project launches, Coldwell Banker has remained dormant since 2008 until now. We have to revive and grow the Coldwell Banker brand within the next five years, says Jack Chua, CEO of ERA and Coldwell Banker. Coldwell Banker and ERA, along with Century 21 and Sothebys International Realty, are owned by New York Stock Exchange-listed real estate services company Realogy. In Singapore, Coldwell Banker and ERA are under Northstar. Chua (left) and Goh Consolidation With eight consecutive rounds of property cooling measures culminating in the total debt servicing ratio loan framework in June 2013, residential transaction volume has halved to between 7,000 and 7,500 units over the last two years. Likewise, the number of new agents fell to 1,299 last year less than half the 3,006 new entrants in 2014, according to the Council for Estate Agencies. There has been a wave of consolidation in the real estate industry, with franchises changing hands. In Singapore, Century 21 is owned by Asia-Pacific Strategic Investments, a former Malaysian bereavement services company that transformed itself into a real estate services firm last year. APSI acquired Century 21 Hong Kong and Asia-Pacific, which includes the Singapore franchise, followed by Global Alliance Property in Singapore in 2015. Sothebys debuted in Singapore in 2007, when it was brought in by a group of high-net-worth investors. However, it subsequently closed. The luxury brand returned to Singapore in March this year. This time, it is operated by List Holdings Singapore, the entity that also operates List Sothebys International Realty in Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii. The Singapore business is headed by Hisashi Kitami, owner and CEO of List Sothebys. There is an urgency to grow the Coldwell Banker franchise in Singapore, concedes Chua. When Coldwell Banker first started in Singapore 16 years ago, it operated as a division of ERA. The real estate services offered by both entities were similar. People started asking why we have ERA and Coldwell Banker. It was like we were cannibalising our own business, he says. That led to the decision to combine the two under ERA eight years ago. Franchise model This time around, Chua is taking a different tack to grow Coldwell Banker as a separate entity. He is using the franchise model, which is similar to that of Century 21. Chua is making an effort to target small- and medium- sized real estate agencies to bring them under the umbrella brand of Coldwell Banker. At the same time, the individual companies can keep their respective brands, he says. For example, the first company to sign up as a franchisee was Elitehill Real Estate. That was in January. By February, its owner Martin Goh had convinced three more agencies to sign up. So far, there are 11 Coldwell Banker franchisees with a salesforce of 80. The agencies range from sole entrepreneurs to firms with 30 salespersons. Another handful of agencies are coming on board, says Goh. Goh has become more than just a poster child for Coldwell Banker. He was appointed general manager of Coldwell Banker in Singapore and will oversee the expansion of the franchise. However, he will continue to manage his firm, now renamed Coldwell Banker Elitehill Real Estate. The main attraction for most small- and medium-sized agencies is that they will become part of an international brand and will be able to tap both local deals from ERA and overseas deals from other Coldwell Banker franchisees around the world, says Goh. They will also be able to leverage ERAs training programmes for their salespersons and technology platforms that small firms are unable to provide. Coldwell Banker will have its own corporate office within the 7,000 sq ft space at SLF Building. There will be meeting rooms and desks for agents to use, like a co-working space. According to Chua, the target is to have at least 20 franchisees in Singapore by the end of the year. To attract new franchisees, the fee has also been kept at an attractive level. Its in the range of $1,500 to $3,000 for three years, he says. This article appeared in The Edge Property pullout, Issue 742 (Aug 22, 2016) of The Edge Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The bigger loss of $1.4 million was traced to a 2,637 sq ft unit at Reflections at Keppel Bay. The seller purchased the unit from the developer in August 2007 at $2,125 psf and resold it at $1,593 psf. This is the biggest loss sustained at the project since April 2012, when a 4,747 sq ft unit changed hands at a loss of $1.58 million. The transaction also marks the eighth unprofitable deal at the project this year. Of the 16 homes sold at the project this year, only three were profitable. Reflections at Keppel Bay is a 99-year leasehold development comprising 1,129 units on Keppel Bay View. It was completed in 2011. The smaller loss of $726,450 was from a 1,711 sq ft unit at The Oceanfront @ Sentosa. The unit was purchased in October 2007 at $2,125 psf in a sub-sale and resold at $1,525 psf. This marks the second 1,711 sq ft unit from the project sold at a loss this year. In April, a similar-sized unit on the sixth floor was disposed of at a $487,780 loss. The only profitable deal of the four units sold this year at The Oceanfront @ Sentosa was for a 1,216 sq ft unit, which netted a $99,200 gain for the seller. The 264-unit, 99-year leasehold development was completed in 2010. A 2,637 sq ft unit at Reflections at Keppel Bay was sold at a $1.4 million loss In the same week, Watten Estate Condominium, a 104-unit freehold development on Shelford Road in prime District 11, saw its most profitable transaction on Aug 3, when a 2,594 sq ft unit changed hands for a profit of $1.83 million. The unit was purchased in January 2003 at $393 psf and resold at $1,099 psf, reflecting an annualised gain of 8%. Prior to this, the most profitable deal at the project accrued to a 2,594 sq ft unit at block 36, which reaped $1.78 million in profit in October 2011. All homes sold at the project since 2010 have been profitable. Watten Estate Condominium was completed in 1983. Separately, three condo units fetched profits exceeding $1 million in the week of Aug 2 to 8. The most profitable deal accrued to a 2,260 sq ft unit at Four Seasons Park, in which the seller amassed $1.86 million. He purchased the unit in June 2006 at $1,535 psf and resold it at $2,358 psf on Aug 5, which translates to an annualised gain of 4%. Of the two other units sold at Four Seasons Park this year, a 2,874 sq ft unit was resold at a profit of $2.55 million in May, while the profitability of the other, a 2,874 sq ft unit sold in April, could not be traced owing to a lack of data. Four Seasons Park is a 202-unit freehold development located near Orchard Boulevard in prime District 10. The other two deals with million-dollar profits were in District 5. The bigger profit of $1.16 million was from a 1,841 sq ft unit at The Grandhill, a 53-unit freehold development on Pasir Panjang Hill. The unit on the fifth floor was resold at $1,103 psf, more than double its purchase price of $473 psf in April 2004. The seller had previously purchased the unit from the developer. The annualised gain works out to be 7%. In February, however, a 1,830 sq ft unit at the project was sold at a loss of $20,000, despite being held for close to eight years. So far, only two transactions at the project were traced to a loss. The Grandhill was completed in 2006. The smaller profit of $1.1 million accrued to a 2,013 sq ft unit at Varsity Park Condominium. The unit was purchased in November 2004 at $374 psf and resold at $919 psf on Aug 3, reflecting an annualised gain of 8%. Of the 336 resale transactions at the condo so far, only four sustained losses, based on URA caveat records. All of the unprofitable homes were purchased from the resale market, and held for less than four years. Varsity Park Condominium is a 530-unit, 99-year leasehold development on West Coast Road.

Woods Square is the first mixed-use commercial development with strata offices for sale in Woodlands Central. When completed at end-2021, Woods Square will be linked to the neighbouring Woodlands Civic Centre and Causeway Point shopping mall and the Woodlands MRT station. The commercial project comprises two office towers, a pair of SOLO (small office, loft office) blocks and a retail podium with 39 shops and a 5,000 sq ft childcare centre. The entire project has a total gross floor area of 700,000 sq ft. Tower 1 has 16 floors and houses 365 strata offices for sale. A key feature of these strata offices, which measure 549 to 5,339 sq ft, is their ceiling height of 4.2m. Most of the units released for sale are from this tower. Showflat of a typical office at a Woods Square unit with 4.2m ceiling height Showflat of a 500 sq ft SOLO unit with 5m ceiling height The 12-storey Tower 2 features large floor plates of 23,000 sq ft, and will be available only for lease. The tower has already secured its first anchor tenant FEO, which will be relocating its satellite offices from across Singapore to Woods Square when the mixed-use commercial project is completed. FEO will occupy 70,000 sq ft spanning 3 floors of Tower 2. It demonstrates confidence in both the location and project, says Shaw Lay See, FEOs chief operating officer for the property sales business group. The company will maintain its headquarters at Far East Plaza on Scotts Road, a mixed-use development built in 1983 by the groups founder, the late Ng Teng Fong. The fourth floor of Tower 2 will have shared amenities for office users, such as meeting and conference rooms, an auditorium, a gym and swimming pool. Meanwhile, the two SOLO blocks at Woods Square comprise a total of 101 units measuring 495 to 1,808 sq ft: SOLO 1 has 49 units and SOLO 2 has 52. The main attraction of the SOLOs is that they have a 5m ceiling height and come with a built-in raised platform. Part of SOLO 1 has been released. FEO will be holding the retail units for lease so that it can better manage the tenant mix. It will also engage a reputable operator for the childcare centre. Designed by DP Architects, Woods Square occupies two adjacent sites with a total land area of 199,873 sq ft. The sites were purchased by a joint venture between the privately held FEO, its listed entity Far East Orchard and Japanese developer Sekisui House when they won the government land tender with a top bid of $634 million, or $906 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr) in April 2014. The partners have also received approval from the government to offer strata offices for sale. Prices range from $1,700 to $2,300 psf, or start from $970,000 for a 506 sq ft unit. Shaw says the prices of offices sold at Woods Square averaged $1,800 psf, with SOLO units at an average of $1,950 psf. Woods Square is the first mixed-use commercial development in Woodlands Central offering strata and loft offices for sale Early buyers Property analysts have pointed out that the price paid for the Woods Square site is 10% less than the $1,009 psf ppr that Sim Lian paid for its Vision Exchange site at Jurong Gateway in December 2012. Vision Exchange features a 25-storey office tower with a retail podium. It has a total of 740 units of offices, medical suites and F&B spaces. Strata offices measure 441 to 1,938 sq ft. Since the strata offices at Vision Exchange were launched for sale in April 2014, they have fetched prices of $1,907 to $2,503 psf. The two most recent transactions were those of two adjacent units on the 16th floor: A 764 sq ft unit was sold for $1.79 million ($2,346 psf) in June and a 840 sq ft unit fetched $1.95 million ($2,323 psf) in April. Vision Exchange is the only office building with strata units for sale in Jurong Gateway, just like Woods Square in Woodlands Central, says Eugene Lim, key executive officer of ERA Realty. One can see the potential that premium strata offices in Woodlands Central can achieve as more plans unfold. Lim: One can see the potential that premium strata offices in Woodlands Central can command as moreplans unfold The idea of turning Jurong East into a second CBD the size of Marina Bay (360ha) was mooted in 2008. Besides being turned into a business district, it will feature the Jurong Innovation District and terminus for the high-speed rail connecting Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. When it was first announced that Jurong would be the next CBD, the most common comment was, But Jurong is so far away, recounts Lim. But look at it today. Its completely transformed. The same thing will happen in Woodlands. It is clear that businesses that have seen how the government has transformed Tampines and Jurong are also willing to take a bet on Woodlands as the third regional centre. According to FEOs Shaw, about 60% of the buyers are Singaporeans buying under their company names. She adds that many of these companies have their factories or warehouses in the Woodlands industrial estates and are looking to have an office where they can meet clients or open a showroom or sales gallery. ERAs Lim says the Woods Square offices also appeal to family-owned companies that are now in the hands of the second- or third-generation who tend to be more educated and more conscious about branding and image. Most of them are buying for their own use, with some considering an investment play in addition to own use, adds Shaw. The SOLOs in particular appeal to lifestyle companies and the younger set. For instance, one of the units was sold to a wine importer who likes the high ceiling, as he intends to use the unit to display his collection and host events, she says. Plans to extend the Thomson-East Coast Line from Woodlands North MRT station to Johor Baru has also generated keen interest among companies looking to set up their head office in Singapore, while their factories are located in Johor. Therefore, Woods Square has drawn another group of buyers Malaysian business owners with operations in Johor. They are already familiar with Woodlands and want to have an office in Singapore, says Shaw. They are our second-biggest group of buyers. Shaw: Malaysian business owners with operations in Johor are the second-biggest group of buyers ofWoods Square units Betting on transformation Plans for the Woodlands Regional Centre were announced in 2013. The regional centre contains two precincts: the commercial components that make up Woodlands Central and Woodlands North Coast, a mixed-use business cluster. Woods Square in Woodlands Central is the first sale of site by the government since the announcement of Woodlands Regional Centre. The second site in Woodlands Central was put up for sale last year and sits on the Reserved List of the government land sales programme, waiting to be triggered by a developer. The 99-year leasehold site has a land area of about 240,950 sq ft and maximum gross floor area of 843,327 sq ft. Sixty per cent of the GFA has to be allocated for office use, and 86,000 sq ft for retail and F&B outlets. The remaining GFA can be used to develop more office space, residential units or even serviced apartments. More than 100ha slightly smaller than the size of Sentosa Cove will be made available for sale in the coming years. The land can yield 700,000 sq m (more than 7.5 million sq ft) of commercial space and generate 100,000 new jobs over the next 10 to 15 years. The governments intention is for the Woodlands Regional Centre to be the gateway in the northern region and anchor the development of the North Coast Innovation Corridor, which will include the future Punggol Creative Cluster and Learning Corridor and upcoming redevelopment of the Sembawang Shipyard area. It will also be linked to Seletar Aerospace Park in the future. The idea is to bring jobs closer to home, as more than half a million residents are already living in the northern region of Woodlands, Yishun and Sembawang. ERAs Lim says, The potential increase in population, new jobs created, park connectors and improvement in transport network with the North-South Corridor and the new MRT station in Woodlands North to JB, and direct connection to the CBD and even Changi Airport will make Woodlands a more exciting place to work and live in. Over time, more MNCs will move to Woodlands, like what we saw in Tampines 20 years ago, when banks and insurance companies set up offices there, and what weve seen in Jurong in recent years. First-mover advantage Therefore, FEO has first-mover advantage in Woodlands, says Shaw. Woods Square may be its maiden office development in Woodlands Regional Centre, but it is not the developers first project in the area. When the Singapore American School moved to its new and expanded campus in Woodlands in 1996, FEO developed a collection of 33 New England-style mansions called Woodgrove Estate, adjacent to the campus. The houses were completed in 1997 and FEO still holds many of them for lease, as they are popular with American expatriates whose children attend the school, she adds. Asking rents for six-bedroom detached houses with a built-up area of 7,599 sq ft and occupying a 7,589 sq ft site in Woodgrove Estate are listed at $9,500 a month. Meanwhile, seven- bedroom detached houses with a built-up area of 8,547 sq ft and land area of 8,547 sq ft are available for lease at $13,000 a month. Based on the historical price of a detached house sitting on a land area of 7,459 sq ft that was sold for $3.22 million in 1997, and rental rate of about $9,500 a month today, the gross rental yield translates to about 3.5%. In 1997, FEO developed Woodgrove Estate with its New England-style mansions, popular with American expatriates whose children attend the Singapore American School next door FEO also developed the 478-unit Casablanca, a condominium located off Woodlands Avenue 1 that was completed in 2005. The 99- year leasehold project was launched for sale in July 2002, and units were sold at an average of $450 psf at the time. The sole transaction this year was that of a 1,184 sq ft unit on the eighth floor that changed hands for $936,000 ($791 psf) in April. The private condo is popular with upgraders because it is just a five-minute walk from the Woodlands MRT station, according to property agents. Adjacent to Casablanca is Woodhaven, a 337-unit residential development occupying a 225,600 sq ft site. The 99-year leasehold development offered a mix of condo units, small office, home office (SOHO) and townhouses, and saw strong sales when it was launched in mid-2011. Sale prices for the condos averaged $1,000 psf; the SOHO units were about $1,030 psf and the townhouses, $800 psf. The project was completed just last year. In Woodlands, FEO also developed executive condo La Casa, located off Woodlands Avenue 5. When the 444-unit EC was launched in 2005, average prices of units sold were $382 psf. The project was completed in 2008. According to a caveat lodged on Aug 15, a 904 sq ft unit changed hands for $734,000 ($812 psf). The seller had purchased it in December 2005 for $379,130 ($419 psf), thus enjoying an almost doubling in value of the property over the past decade. FEO also developed Nordcom 1 and Nordcom 2 two light industrial (Business 1) complexes on Gambas Avenue. The industrial sites were purchased from JTC on 30-year leases. Nordcom 1 has a total of 131 strata industrial units, of which 50% have been sold; Nordcom 2 has 347 strata industrial units, of which 40% have been sold. While Nordcom 1 is targeted for completion later this year, Nordcom 2 is projected to be completed by 2018. In the latest transaction at Nordcom 2, a 1,668 sq ft unit on the fourth floor was sold for $475,000 ($285 psf) in June, based on caveats lodged. At Nordcom 1, the last transaction saw a 1,690 sq ft unit sold for $508,000 ($301 psf) in June last year. Woodlands is not the only area in which FEO has been a market pioneer. In 2012, we were a first mover in Punggol with the launch of Water town a mixed-use complex with residential units and a shopping mall. We were also the first to introduce innercity living in Tanjong Pagar with the preview of Icon 13 years ago, she adds.

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Since the Singapore government has ceased to offer freehold land parcels under its Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme, and with most residential properties occupying 99-year leasehold sites, it would be interesting to observe the price performance of leasehold properties as their tenures run out. Lessees may apply to top up the lease to a fresh 99 years. However, a lease extension will typically be granted only if it involves land use intensification or urban renewal, such as in an en-bloc sale for redevelopment. Meanwhile, the recent hike in development charge rates and the continued enforcement of the Qualifying Certificates Rule have further diminished chances of a successful en-bloc sale for leasehold sites. For new developments, there is no clear winner between leasehold and freehold properties in terms of price performance. However, things could change when the remaining lease gets shorter. For one, financial institutions might be reluctant to extend loans for properties with a short balance lease. The loans are usually granted on a case-by-case basis and come with a lower loan-to-value ratio or shorter tenure. There are also more restrictions in using CPF savings to finance the purchase of such properties, such as a stipulation of a minimum remaining lease of 30 years. For properties with a remaining lease of between 30 and 60 years, the buyers age and the remaining lease must total at least 80 years. All this means that as the remaining lease runs down, the pool of potential buyers will shrink. To illustrate: 30-year-old buyers can only use CPF savings for properties with a balance tenure of at least 50 years while buyers above 40 years of age can still use CPF savings for a property with a balance tenure of at least 40 years. There are also limits on the amount of CPF savings that buyers can use to pay for such homes, based on this formula: (Remaining lease of the property when buyer is 55 years old) / (Lease of the property at the point of purchase) x (Valuation Limit). The Valuation Limit is the lower of the purchase price or the value of the property at the time of purchase. Positive examples Surprisingly, however, ageing leasehold properties have shown positive price performance despite the seemingly gloomy outlook.Factors such as en-bloc potential and attractive rents appear to make up for their reducing tenure. New condos in their vicinity would also have boosted their prices. One example is theGolden Mile Complex, whose 99-year leasehold tenure started from August 1969, giving it a balance lease of approximately 52 years. It was one of sites offered under the first sale of sites programme. The latest transaction in the project took place in April last year, when a 2,196 sq ft unit on the 15th floor fetched $638 psf. The same unit sold for $364 psf in December 1996. The price appreciation of 75% surpassed the URA price index, which rose 18% between 4Q1996 and 2Q2015. Golden Mile Complex is located at the city fringe, which is also home to other ageing leasehold properties such asPearl Bank Apartment,Sherwood Tower,Textile CentreandThe Plaza, with a remaining lease of less than 60 years as at 2016. In the past decade, the average price for these properties has risen from $309 psf in 2006 to $767 psf in 2016, or around 10% a year. In comparison, the URA price index for private non-landed homes in Rest of Central Region appreciated 4% a year over the same period. The price appreciation of older leasehold condos also appears attractive when compared against that of new projects. AtSouthbank, a relatively new project in the same district as Golden Mile Complex, a 969 sq ft apartment on a high floor was transacted at $1,538 psf this year. Since the seller had purchased the unit direct from the developer at $549 psf in 2006, the sale has yielded an annualised gain of 11% over the past decade. The figure may seem superior as Southbank has strong site attributes, such as a riverfront location and proximity to the Lavender MRT station. Southbank is a mixed-use development comprising a 197-unit residential block and a 60-unit SoHo block. It sits on the site of the former Eng Cheong Tower, which was the first collective sale in Singapore to involve the topping up of the lease to a fresh 99 years. The project was completed in 2010. A number of ageing leasehold properties are located in prime districts 9, 10 and 11 as well as in the Downtown Core. Prominent developments includeHillcrest Arcadia,International Plaza,Peace Centre/ Mansions,Peoples Park CentreandPeoples Park Complex. Prices for these developments have appreciated by around 8% a year over the past decade. In comparison, the URA price index for private non-landed homes in the Core Central Region rose 4% a year over the same period. Golden Mile Complex, one of the leasehold properties with a remaining tenure of less than 60 years Alternative methodology A more intensive methodology of assessing the price performance of ageing leasehold properties is to compute the profit and loss of unit sales and compare the figures against the change in the URA price index for private non-landed homes over the same period. For example, atHillcrest Arcadia, which has a 99-year leasehold tenure from 1975, a 1,711 sq ft unit was bought at $339 psf in January 2005 and resold at $952 psf in September 2015. The 180% price appreciation is higher than the 69% growth in price index over the same period. According to this measure, many of the oldest private non-landed homes in Central Region have outperformed the index even as their balance lease runs down (see charts). Homes resold with a balance lease of 60 years or less had the highest majority of outperformers 86% (289 of 335 cases) followed by those with balance leases of 60-65 years (81%, or 447 of 550) and 65-70 years (78%, or 626 of 801). However, in Outside Central Region, the trend was the opposite, with the proportion of transactions that outperformed the index slipping as the balance lease approaches 65 years and below. This difference in fortunes could be owing to the scarcity of GLS offerings in Central Region, leading to higher en-bloc potential for older properties in Central Region, and limited supply in general. Thus, regardless of the financing issues and restrictions on the use of CPF savings, older leasehold homes, particularly those in the city centre, appear to stand the test of time in monetary terms. Only time will tell if they can maintain their value as the lease reaches its end. Currently, the shortest remaining lease may be held by the apartments atBedok Shopping Complex, which sits on a site with a 60-year lease from 1977. A 1,216 sq ft apartment fetched $288,000 ($237 psf) in March, reflecting a hefty 25% price decline from 2013, when two units went for $317 psf on average. Still, it is difficult to establish a trend as transactions were scarce. On the other hand, three similar-sized units have fetched an average rent of $3,067 per month this year, which translates into a very attractive rental yield.

Another wave of sales followed after its completion. Its popularity is due to its location within a five-minute walk from the Bishan MRT interchange station, Junction 8 shopping mall, popular schools such as Ai Tong Primary and Raffles Institution, and the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. Meanwhile, in the popular city-fringe neighbourhood of Ang Mo Kio, Wheelock Properties The Panorama is also seeing brisk sales. According to agents, there were only 25 units left in the 698- unit condo project as at end-August. The development, which comprises two 20-storey blocks and four 17-storey blocks, is scheduled for completion in either 2018 or 2019. From May to July, monthly the number of new home sales at The Panorama ranged from 18 to 32, according to URA data. Attractive pricing, with three-bedroom units starting from $1.2 million, is the key reason behind the good sales performance, says an agent with Knight Frank, who declined to be named. Two units at The Panorama were sold in the week of Aug 30 to Sept 6. One was a 990 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the third floor that fetched $1.21 million ($1,223 psf), while the other was a 1,012 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the ground floor that was sold for $1.20 million ($1,185 psf). The Panorama is a 99-year leasehold condo development on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 2. The project is located near the upcoming Mayflower MRT station on the Thomson-East Coast Line, which is scheduled to open in 2020. The project is also located adjacent to the popular CHIJ St Nicholas Girls School. Launched in January 2014, The Panorama initially saw tepid sales. The developer took a $110 million provision for the project, which was relaunched in May 2014 with discounts of at least 10%. The Panorama is 96% sold. The one- and two-bedroom units as well as two-bedroom-plus-study units are fully sold. Still available are 1,066 sq ft, three-bedroom units priced from $1.22 million to $1.3 million and 1,163 sq ft, three-bedroom-plus-study units priced from $1.36 million to $1.42 million.

It was installed several years ago. I dont have a view from my office, explains Toh, managing director of ACT Holdings. So, I thought I should introduce some indoor live greenery and fish. When Toh purchased the goldfish several years ago, they were only the size of his thumb. Now, theyve grown so much that even the aquarium maintenance guy is surprised that they can grow so well in a fish tank of this size, he says. The rate of growth of the fish rivals that of his property portfolio. Over the past two decades, ACT has developed 25 residential projects in Singapore, many of which are conventional landed and strata landed housing projects in both the prime districts and the suburbs. These include several waterfront bungalows at Sentosa Cove and a row of terraces called Villas at Sentosa Cove; Ventura Heights, a strata housing project with eight bungalows and 32 semi-detached houses at Astrid Hill; One Mount Rosie, a strata landed development with 12 units; and the 59-unit strata landed project Watten Residences. ACTs last major site acquisition was the former Singapore Crocodile Farm at 1 Surin Avenue/ 709 Upper Serangoon Road. ACT, along with its partners Nobel Design Holdings and Pinnacle Assets Group, purchased the two adjoining sites with a combined site area of 42,851 sq ft for $37.5 million, according to a caveat lodged in September 2012. Relaunch of One Surin The site has since been redeveloped intoOne Surin, a strata landed housing project with 27 units. The freehold project is scheduled to be completed by year-end, and ACT Holdings intends to relaunch the project then. Home buyers will be able to appreciate the project better when its completed, says Toh. This was evident when another strata landed housing project by ACT Holdings was completed in March this year. Only seven strata terraced units in the project, calledCharlton 27, remain unsold. Most of the units were sold when the project was launched in May 2013, just a month before the introduction of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) loan framework at end-June that year, which caused home sales across the island to wither. Sales picked up after the completion of Charlton 27. Three units with built-up areas of 4,758 to 5,952 sq ft have been sold for $3.08 million ($647 psf) to $3.54 million ($595 psf), according to caveats lodged with URA Realis from April to June. All the strata terraced houses at Charlton 27 come with five en suite bedrooms, a lift, fully fitted kitchen and private basement parking for two cars. The units at One Surin, which were launched in July 2014, have slightly smaller built-up areas, generally ranging between 3,789 and 4,166 sq ft, with four bedrooms. The houses are also priced lower, at under $3 million. Two units with strata areas of 3,789 to 3,821 sq ft were sold recently for $2.6 million ($705 psf) and $2.67 million ($680 psf) respectively, according to caveats lodged in June and September. Restrictions in strata housing development A month after One Surin was launched, the government introduced new regulations for strata housing development in August 2014. They included a recalibration of the formulae used to calculate the maximum number of dwelling units allowed in a strata landed housing development using only 40% of the total land area to be divided by the typical footprint of a conventional landed housing unit. The minimum communal open space within a development was also increased from 30% to 45% with immediate effect, with at least 25% to be set aside for on-ground greenery. This basically reduces the number of units a developer can build in a strata housing project. On the other hand, it will further enhance the quality of the living environment for residents, said URA. This revision comes on the back of an earlier change in guidelines in February 2009, which had already capped the number of units that can be built on a development site. It required that dwelling units have a minimum plot size of 150 sq m for terraced units, 200 sq m for semi-detached and 400 sq m for detached houses. The maximum number of units to be built cannot exceed the development site area. That had already reduced the number of strata housing units that a developer can build on a site. Both Charlton 27 and One Surin were launched before the new guidelines announced in August 2014 kicked in. Yet, these two projects are what we consider the fourth-generation strata landed housing projects by the developer, says Thomas Ang, associate director of OrangeTee, who is marketing Charlton 27. Potential buyers will be able to appreciate the difference between these two projects and the other strata landed housing projects in the same neighbourhood. He reckons the strata terraced units will appeal to those who want freehold tenure, a new property that they can move into immediately, and five bedrooms. ACT is no stranger to the Kovan neighbourhood, located just off Upper Serangoon Road, having launched a handful of residential projects there over the past five years. Three are fully sold and completed: 21-unit strata landed housing development Charlton Residences, a joint venture with SingHaiYi Group that was completed in 2014; 198-unit Casa Cambio, a private condo also completed in 2014; and neighbouring 53-unit Cambio Suites, a private condo that was completed earlier this year. Targeting growth areas We target areas where we see growth, says Toh. Property values go up where theres improvement in infrastructure, good schools and job growth and that will lead to population growth. Besides the Kovan area, ACT has also developed many strata landed housing projects in the Braddell Heights neighbourhood, for instance Dunsfold Residences, a six-unit strata- titled bungalow development; Matlock Residences, a six strata bungalow development; and Muswell Hill, a bungalow development with three houses. Toh: We target areas where we see growth Tohs interest in property development that began 20 years ago was initially driven by a desire for adaptive reuse. That led to his first project, Gambier Court on Kim Yam Road, which was the building of a 12-storey extension with 23 apartments behind a row of conserved shophouses. The 99-year leasehold development was completed in 1999 and won the URA Heritage Award. ACTs second project was the acquisition of a row of dilapidated shophouses at 42 to 45 Mosque Street in Chinatown in 2002 from URA. They were built in the 1930s by the Singapore Improvement Trust to house customs officers during the colonial era. They have since been restored and converted into Empire Lofts, a residential project for long-term lease. Completed in 2004, it also won the URA Heritage Award. The apartments at Empire Loft are a mix of one- and two-bedroom units, which are leased at $3,000 to about $6,000 a month. They continue to be popular with expatriates, says Toh. It is also where ACT has its Singapore headquarters. This year, the company completed two pairs of semi-detached houses called Greenview Residences at Greenview Crescent, off Bukit Timah. All four semi-detached houses have been sold at $5 million to $6 million each. Following the relaunch of One Surin and the sale of the remaining units at Charlton 27, ACT will have no other new developments in the pipeline. Were not planning to invest in any large deals in Singapore in the next year, says Toh. This is contrary to many investors who believe that the time is ripe to return to the prime residential market as bargains have started to emerge. Even though prime condo prices in Singapore have corrected, gross yields are still sub 3%, which makes the investment case difficult, points out Toh. Empire Lofts, apartments on long-term lease, is located within a row of three adjoining conserved shophouses built in the 1930s Looking abroad ACT has turned its attention to the overseas markets instead, primarily in the US and Indonesia. Its maiden development in Indonesia is a condominium project in Alam Sutera Township, an emerging area in Greater Jakarta. It is a joint venture project with several partners and will be launched in Jakarta later this year. If the rules regarding foreign home ownership become clearer, we may consider bringing the project to Singapore, says Toh. In the US, ACT established its head office in Atlanta, Georgia in the early 1980s. Tohs father, entrepreneur Toh Aik Choon (A C), founded ACT Enterprises in 1969. He was also an early investor in the US real estate market, with a development on industrial land in Dekalb County, Georgia through Atlanta International Industrial Park Inc. In 1987, A C started ACT Investments with Peter E Chang, and the companys first project was the development of a 36-storey luxury apartment tower, the Grandview in Buckhead, Atlanta. A C passed away in 1990 at 63, when Toh was only 25 and working at his first job in consulting firm Booz Allen. There was not enough time for my father to pass on a lot of his experience, says Toh, a father of three boys aged six to 14. He was also more of an industrialist and entrepreneur than a property developer. Having attended school in the US, Toh was well acquainted with the country. In 1982, he entered the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta as a freshman and subsequently obtained his bachelors degree at MIT and an MBA at Wharton Business School in Boston. Focus on rental apartments Just as he did in Singapore, Toh focused on residential developments, particularly in the southeast region of the US, in cities such as Atlanta; Jacksonville, Florida; Charlotte and Durham in North Carolina; and Nashville, Tennessee. These cities are probably not on the radar of most Asian investors, says Toh. However, they have enjoyed strong job and population growth over the last five to 10 years. The cap rates are reasonable. And as long as they continue to attract the millennials to move there for better quality of life and job opportunities, these markets will continue to expand. Many of the projects developed by ACT in the US are apartments for rent rather than condo blocks for sale. They include Bluwater in Jacksonville, Florida, a project completed 1 years ago; Canton Mill Lofts, a collection of historic mill buildings located about a mile from downtown Canton, Georgia; and Inman Quarter Apartments at Atlantas Inman Park. The only project that ACT currently has for sale in the US is 1065 Midtown in Atlanta. A luxury condo with 52 units span the 27th to 38th floors of the high-rise tower. The lower floors are occupied by the Loews Atlanta Hotel, and the residents will be able to enjoy the amenities and services of the hotel. The units at 1065 Midtown were launched for sale last year, and half have already been taken up. The units a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments are priced from US$1 million to US$2 million each, or US$600 to US$700 psf. This is expensive by Atlanta standards, although in Singapore, its considered mid-market because prices here are so high, says Toh. About five years ago, ACT invested in TriBridge Residential, a multi-family investment, development and management company. Founded in 1998 in Atlanta, it manages more than 10,000 residential units in properties across Georgia, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina. Toh intends to continue investing in the US. Comparing asset prices and growth opportunities globally, the US is still a relatively attractive market, he says. Bluwater in Jacksonville, Florida is one of the properties developed with apartments for rent Source: ACT Holdings Canton Mill Lofts is a collection of historic mill buildings located about a mile from downtown Canton, Georgia Source: ACT Holdings Continued investment in the US Toh had stepped up his investments in the US since 2009, following the global financial crisis. Prices have recovered from the lowest points of the financial crisis in 2009, says Toh. Were no longer looking at distressed deals. I think everything is at fair value today. Where we buy depends on where we perceive growth. Were looking for superior growth rather than distressed valuations. It is more important to invest based on fundamentals, which means looking at yield-based valuation of assets, adds Toh. For him, the US multi-family assets in ACTs core markets such as Atlanta continue to yield 8% gross a year, with positive earnings growth momentum. So, thats where we will continue to allocate our capital, he says. At 1065 Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, the 52 luxury apartments are perched on the 27th to 38th floors of the tower Source: ACT Holdings Rents of apartments in Atlanta and Nashville are about half the rate in the gateway cities of Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Many average Americans cant afford to live in these gateway cities, says Toh. While salaries in these big cities may be higher, the rents may take up half their pay. This has led to more Americans moving south to Atlanta, Nashville and Charlotte to enjoy a lower cost of living, he adds. In Singapore, the homeownership rate was 90.8% in 2015, according to the Department of Statistics. Meanwhile, in the US, it was 62.9% in 2Q2016, according to the Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce. Over the past five years, the recovery in the US market has been driven mainly by rental apartments more so than condos for sale. That trend could reverse, with more condos built for sale again. If more people decide to buy their own condo unit rather than rent, theres an opportunity to do a conversion, that is, to strata title the units for sale, says Toh. Thats a potential exit for some of our properties. In the US, it is just a matter of changing the legal use of the property, he adds. Toh visits the US at least three times a year and has a home in Atlanta, as it is where the head office is. Like everyone else, he is monitoring the US presidential election closely. He is not deterred from continuing to invest in the country, regardless of the outcome of the election, he says.

This marks the most profitable transaction at the 453-unit freehold project since November 2012, when a 2,325 sq ft, ground-floor unit netted a profit of $2.4 million. Four other units from the development transacted profitably this year, with two fetching gains of more than $1 million.

Equity markets are forward-looking and when participants grow overly pessimistic about the future, share prices fall too much. This creates opportunities for cool-headed investors who focus on fundamental value, realistic forward scenarios and have sufficiently long horizons.Today, we see these opportunities in three high-end developer stocks. While private home prices will likely correct further, we believe their share prices now reflect too-bearish expectations on the extent of the correction.For instance, Wing Tai Holdings, developer of the Le Nouvel Ardmore and Nouvel 18 condominiums in prime district 10, is now trading at 42 per cent of its last reported book value of S$4.04 per share as at end June 2016. This is a valuation discount of S$2.35 per share or S$1.8 billion.This discount is too big. If it was spread proportionally across Wing Tai's entire reported asset base as at end June 2016, which includes less risky assets such as cash, leased offices and retail shops in addition to its riskier unsold condominiums, we derive market-implied valuations of S$1,300 to S$1,500 per square foot (psf) for the group's Nouvel 18 and Le Nouvel Ardmore projects.Contrast this with the S$2,300 psf price in cash for Nouvel 18 that Wing Tai subsequently sold in July 2016 to its joint venture partner City Developments, and the market's over-pessimism becomes clear.Similar opportunities also exist for undervalued high-end developers such as Wheelock Properties, which developed Ardmore Three and the Scotts Square Condominium in Orchard, and OUE Limited, which developed OUE Twin Peaks in Orchard. These three developers, including Wing Tai, trade at deep discounts to their respective book values, ranging from 40 per cent to 58 per cent.Their share prices all reflect expectations of housing price declines in the magnitude of 35 per cent or more, which are too steep compared to our base case forecast of a 5 per cent to 15 per cent dip over 2016-17 and a recovery in 2018. Our forecast is in turn underpinned by the two fundamental realities of demand and supply in the Singapore market.On the demand side, buying interest from prospective home owners and investors has picked up as prices declined. Developers who have implemented reasonable discounts and differentiated sales strategies, such as deferred payment schemes, have been successful at garnering sales at previously torpid projects, as we have seen with OUE at its Twin Peaks condominium. With a high price elasticity of demand, we see a deep correction in home prices to be unlikely, barring seismic shifts in macro-economic conditions or interest rates.While one cannot be certain about the trajectory of housing measures ahead, there is a meaningful likelihood that the worst of regulatory headwinds is behind us, now that existing curbs have successfully stabilised the market and private home prices have fallen double digit percentages from the peak. This is particularly good news for the high-end segment which - being the most dependent on foreign demand - has suffered the brunt of existing curbs, particularly the additional buyer's stamp duties (ABSD) which imposed 10 per cent and subsequently 15 per cent upfront duties on foreigner home purchases.As a result, the premium of high-end median psf prices over the mass-market is now 64 per cent - near a 10-year low and more than one standard deviation below the average level of 87 per cent. In the event of any potential curb reversals ahead, in particular the ABSD measures, high-end home prices would outperform those in mid-tier and mass-market.On the supply side, the elephant in the room is the high rate of physical home completions in Singapore, including public housing, which has contributed to rising vacancy rates and falling rents since 2014. This physical over-supply will continue to drive housing price corrections in 2016 and 2017, but we expect the situation to balance out in 2018 as completions fall from an average of 48,000 units per annum over 2014-2017 to 34,000 units in 2018, which will drive a recovery in private home prices.In terms of overall unsold developer inventories, the situation appears benign. As at end-June 2016, the total inventory of unsold private homes in Singapore stands at 21,000 units, significantly below the nine-year average of 34,000 units.Penalties under the Qualifying Certificates (QC) rules, which require all units to be sold within two years after attaining Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) status, do pose concerns for projects which remain largely unsold, including Wing Tai's Le Nouvel Ardmore and Wheelock's Ardmore Three. These penalties will incentivise developers to sell units more quickly, but we do not foresee fire-sale scenarios due to the penalties' manageable impact on generally healthy balance sheets in the sector.As these fundamental realities of demand and supply become visible over time, we believe the undervalued share prices of the high-end developers we highlighted - Wing Tai, Wheelock and OUE - will eventually reflect underlying assets more accurately.These three developers also enjoy healthy balance sheets with net gearing ratios ranging from net cash to 67 per cent, which will buttress them through this down-cycle. Despite slower home sales pressuring earnings over the near to mid-term, they also find respite in recurring income from their rental properties - and for OUE Limited, in its holdings in listed real estate investment trusts, OUE Commercial Reit and OUE Hospitality Trust as well. These income streams help anchor their dividend payments, currently in the range of 1.7 per cent to 4 per cent yield, which shareholders can enjoy as they hold for long-term price appreciation.But the nagging question remains: have these developers' share prices reached their very bottom? The fact is near-term market movements are subject to the vicissitudes of investor emotions, and timing the bottom, in our view, is often a fruitless exercise.Ultimately, what will prove rewarding is averaging into stocks offering attractive risk-reward and a firm margin of safety in terms of fundamental value. In this regard, it is high time to start moving into these high-end developers."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Excitement was high as more than 800 cheques had been collected during the fortnight of previews prior to the launch on Oct 8. By 5pm that day, 337 units or 65% of the total project had been sold at an average price of $1,400 psf. Were very encouraged by the strong response and demand for Forest Woods, said Chia Ngiang Hong, CDL group general manager. He attributes the overwhelming response to the right mix of prime location, unique features, attractive pricing and great value. According to CDL, all the unit types enjoyed a strong take-up, although the one-bedroom-plus-study and two-bedroom units were all sold. The two-bedroom units were popular because owners have the flexibility of turning the study into an en suite for the second bedroom, or an open study. Alternatively, it can also be converted into a walk-in wardrobe for the second bedroom. Prices of the units started from $688,000 for a one-bedroom-with-study, $830,000 for a two-bedroom, $1.1 million for a three-bedroom and $1.65 million for a four-bedroom unit. There were buyers of multiple units, including a family that was said to have snapped up four units. Even one of the three penthouses priced at $2.85 million was taken up that day. Showflat of a three-bedroom unit Source: CDL While many of the buyers were owner occupiers, the project also found favour with investors, especially the one- and two-bedroom units. Due to the limited supply of new projects in this prime location, investors also bought Forest Woods in anticipation of good rental demand, said Chia. 88% of the buyers were said to be Singaporeans, with permanent residents and foreigners making up the remaining 12%. Forest Woods is located within a five-minute walk of the Nex shopping mall, which is integrated with the Serangoon MRT Interchange station which connects the North-East and Circle Lines as well as the Serangoon bus interchange.

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Dressed in a monochromatic striped sweater and ensconced in one of the snug leather armchairs in his office, Kenny Tan, chairman and CEO of Link (THM) Group, says: The property market is very challenging. For boutique developers such as Link (THM), the property cooling measure that has had the most bite is the one requiring them to complete a development and sell all the units within three years of acquiring a site. That is one of the conditions developers have to fulfil in order to be eligible for a remission on the additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) of 10% for sites purchased from January 2011; and of 15% for those bought from January 2013. The three-year time frame applies to development sites with fewer than five houses, and that is the market segment in which most niche developers such as Link (THM) are active. The company was not spared the penalty in its most recent project: a pair of detached houses at 7 and 7A Namly View. No 7 sits on a 5,186 sq ft plot and has a built-up area of 7,084 sq ft, while No 7A sits on a 6,071 sq ft parcel and has a built-up area of 7,395 sq ft. However, Tan had already factored in the ABSD in his initial project feasibility study. This is a premium location, and we believe in building good-quality houses, he says. In a buyers market, we know it will take time to sell the homes. Tan: Every business is tough, whether you are a developer or retailer. So, you must be innovative in marketing your products if you want to stand out from the crowd. Both houses have an identical layout, with four levels including a basement and attic. As the site is elevated, the basement, which houses a lap pool and covered garage, is at street level. The garage has been designed to accommodate up to six cars. The house has five bedrooms, including a guest bedroom, on the first level; a master suite on the attic level; a roof terrace and a living room with double-volume ceiling height of 6.2m. There is also the added convenience of a home lift. The two houses were completed in June and put on the market. No 7A was sold for $12.68 million ($2,091 psf), according to a caveat lodged in July. The buyer is believed to be a Singaporean couple living in the neighbourhood who is downsizing from a larger bungalow. The sale was brokered by K H Tan, managing director and founder of luxury home specialist Newsman Realty. The attraction for many buyers is the fact that the basement carpark is big enough for six cars, compared with most small bungalows, which can only fit two cars in the garage, he says. According to Newsmans Tan, the views from the roof terrace are unparalleled given the sites elevation. A lot of attention has also been paid to the design and finishing of the house, for instance, the use of teak wood for the doors, staircase and bedroom floors; marble flooring for the living, dining and powder rooms and master bathroom; as well as fully fitted kitchen with appliances including a dishwasher. Very taxing for small developer The price tag on No 7 is $14.5 million ($2,796 psf). Link (THM)s Tan says: Land prices are not cheap. Still, all successful businessmen aspire to own a landed property so they can pass it down to their children. A freehold title is therefore very important. The two houses sit on an 11,248 sq ft freehold site where a bungalow built 37 years ago once stood. The bungalow was demolished subsequent to its purchase by Link-THM, which paid $16.28 million ($1,447 psf) for the site, according to a caveat lodged in August 2013. In order for the 15% ABSD to be remitted, Link (THM) would have had to complete the development and sell both houses at Namly View by August 2016, three years after the purchase of the site. This requirement is very taxing for a small developer, laments Tan. The detached house at 7 Namly View is one of two recently completed by Link (THM) and on the market for $14.5 million The living room at 7 Namly View has a 6.2m ceiling For private condominiums, a developer can build a sales gallery and showflats, then launch the project for sale even prior to completion. When it comes to landed property, the developer has to complete at least one unit as a show house first so that buyers can visualise the space, says Tan. But the construction period for both private condos and landed homes is about the same three years, he adds. The government should reconsider this ABSD rule as it will provide relief for small developers. However, he is resigned to the fact that the ABSD is here to stay for the time being. Its already part and parcel of our business, he says. No doubt the market is challenging, and the ABSD is a constraint, but we are always finding innovative ways to grow our business. A consolation is that activity in the landed housing segment has picked up across all property types, says William Wong, managing director of landed housing specialist Realstar Premier Group. This is because houses are more attractively priced today and those who have been searching for the past one or two years are now finding it worthwhile to purchase. A large proportion of the houses on the market are brand new and offered by developers faced with the government-imposed time constraint, he adds. Searching for suitable sites Developers who have sold down their inventory are now back on the market looking for land, says Realstars Wong. The focus, however, is on old, landed sites for redevelopment rather than subdivision of a large piece of land. Their concern is still the ABSD if they are not able to sell all the units within the three-year time frame, he says. Link (THM)s Tan continues to hunt for suitable development sites to purchase. His focus is in neighbourhoods he is familiar with and where he has developed projects in the past Holland Road and Bukit Timah Road in prime Districts 10 and 11, and Goodman Road in the Mountbatten-Katong area in prime District 15. He will continue to focus on developing landed homes, particularly semi-detached and detached houses. In August last year, Link (THM) purchased a partly completed Good Class Bungalow at 15 Binjai Rise for $13 million at an auction by Colliers International. The GCB was a foreclosed property sitting on a freehold site of 17,035 sq ft. Tans purchase price translates to $763 psf. Most homebuyers would hesitate to buy a bungalow that is half built. Not Tan. He had no hesitation as a developer. I have a passion for design, he says. And I see completing the GCB as an opportunity to not only enhance the property but also the neighbourhood. The GCB at Binjai Rise will only be launched for sale when it is completed, he adds. That could be late this year or early next year. Apart from the two houses at Namly View, Link (THM) also recently completed four semi-detached houses at 16 Greendale Avenue. Another four semi-detached houses on Dyson Road and four luxury bungalows at 58 Ban Guan, a development on Greenleaf Road are under construction. The 52-unit private condominium SeaSuites at Pasir Panjang was recently completed and only two units remain available Another residential project that was completed recently by Link (THM) is SeaSuites, a boutique 52-unit private condo on Pasir Panjang Road. The five-storey block is just a short walk from the Haw Par Villa MRT station on the Circle Line. The site was a redevelopment of a 16-unit walk-up apartment block that Link (THM) purchased en bloc for $33 million in 2010. The project was launched for sale in 2013 and marked Tans first foray into condo development. The majority of units at SeaSuites are one- and two-bedders of 517 to 1,410 sq ft. Units were sold at prices ranging from $1,458 to $1,784 psf, according to caveats lodged with URA Realis from January to March 2013. According to Tan, only two units in the freehold condo are still available for sale. Diversifying beyond residential In recent years, Tan has also diversified beyond residential developments. He ventured into commercial property development when he bought a 66,583 sq ft transitional office site with a 15-year lease on Mohamed Sultan Road, just off Robertson Walk. Instead of developing a single 100,000 sq ft office block, he built six smaller blocks of 10,000 to 24,000 sq ft. The buildings, called Sultan Link, have been leased to tenants such as AXS Pte Ltd, the operator of AXS machines; furniture company HomesforLife; and high-end interior design firm Royal Living Singapore. According to Tan, the space at Sultan Link appeals to small and medium-sized companies as they are able to have naming rights to the building. If you take up a 15,000 sq ft office space in a Grade-A building in Raffles Place or Marina Bay, you may be occupying just half a floor or one floor, says Tan. Here, you occupy the whole building and you can put your name on the building. Its a good branding opportunity for these companies. Tan also owns the two Business 1 industrial buildings at 8 and 10 Chang Charn Road, off Leng Kee Road, an area famous for its car showrooms. He had purchased the site at 8 Chang Charn Road in 2006 and developed it into Link (THM)s headquarters. In 2012, he purchased the neighbouring 10 Chang Charn Road and has since redeveloped it into a six-storey building. The first floor of 8 Chang Charn Road is now the showroom for Munich Automobiles BMW Alpina, while the showroom for RUF Automobile, which customises sports cars, is now at 10 Chang Charn Road. Investing in Iskandar Malaysia The biggest project in Link (THM)s portfolio today, however, is its flagship project in Iskandar Malaysia, namely One World Medini, an integrated development with 1.1 million sq ft of retail space, three office blocks and four towers containing a mix of serviced apartments and residences. One World Medini is located near Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios and LegoLand Malaysia Resort, as well as the Sanrio Hello Kitty Town and Thomas Town at Puteri Harbour. According to Tan, the future Nusajaya station for the high-speed rail linking Singapore and Kuala Lumpur is located just a short distance from One World Medini. Link (THM) had ventured into Medini in Iskandar Malaysia in February 2013, committing to develop a mega residential and commercial project with a gross development value of RM2.5 billion, or about $1 billion, based on the prevailing exchange rate then. Artists impression of Link (THM)s biggest investment, One World Medini in Iskandar Malaysia, which will feature three office blocks and four serviced apartment-cum-residence towers Source: Link (THM) With the slowdown in Iskandar Malaysia following the property cooling measures by the Malaysian government and fears of a glut in high-rise condos there, some Singapore players have either put their projects on hold or gone back to the drawing board to reconfigure their mix. We are not putting the project on hold, says Tan. Everything has already been finalised and we are not changing our plans. Tan says he is still confident of Medinis prospects as a special economic zone, where companies that have invested there are given corporate tax exemption until at least 2020. With the rising cost of doing business in Singapore, it is just a matter of time before more companies relocate some of their operations to Iskandar Malaysia, he adds. He is considering moving some of his operations there in the future as well. In Medini, property investors will also not be subject to a property gains tax, unlike elsewhere in Malaysia, and there is no minimum RM1 million requirement for foreign residential property purchases. Readying for launch Tan says he is close to securing a construction company to handle the building of One World Medini as well as to take an equity stake in the development. Positioned as a tourist attraction, it will feature seven different themes, with each a showcase of the architecture, culture and cuisine of a country. Seven architects will be involved in the project, each one focusing on the traditional architecture of their respective country. The seven themes are Chinese, with architecture based on Zujiajiao, an ancient water town in the suburbs of Shanghai; Europe, with architecture inspired by the Italian Renaissance; India (historic architecture of Jaipur); Japan (streets of Kyoto); Korea (traditional architecture); and the US (American rodeo). There will also be traditional Malay kampong since the project is located in Malaysia. We have put a lot of money into Medini, says Tan. Its a bit slower than usual, but we are proceeding with our project as everything has already been finalised. We are going to kick off construction once we have secured a suitable contractor. Upon finalising the main contractor for the Medini project, Tan intends to launch the strata office units for sale within the next three months. The units are 530 to 630 sq ft. Buyers are given the flexibility of combining units to create a larger floor space. Investors in the office space at One World Medini should benefit from the projects proximity to Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios. There are more than 2,000 SMEs from computer graphics to design and other supporting services catering to the needs of Pinewood Studios, Tan says. These companies would want to be located near Pinewood Studios for convenience, he adds. Pinewood Studios, from the UK, is associated with the Harry Potter, James Bond and Star Wars films among the many movie and television series over the decades. Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios maiden production was the 12-episode Marco Polo Netflix original series. Retail struggles Link-THM is also in the retail business. Its in my blood, says Tan. Im still continuing with that business. He had started in the business by working at his fathers handbag shop in Peoples Park Complex before striking out on his own in 1994. He set up a handbag distribution business, operating out of a shophouse on Smith Street. Today, lifestyle brands represented by Link (THM) include Adidas, Havaianas, KEDS, Nike, Puma and Sperry. Link (THM) operates six outlets and stores within stores in malls such as Bugis Plus, Wisma Atria, Tampines One, Jem and Westgate. Tan attributes the dismal retail scene in Singapore to the general global economic slowdown, labour issues, the limited size of the local market and the changing retail scene as more people shop online. The challenge for retailers is that marking down prices alone is not the solution. As a retailer, you cant keep marking down prices because your overheads are fixed, explains Tan. So, your bottom line will be squeezed. Having more factory outlets located away from the prime shopping districts of Singapore could be a solution, he says, giving the example of Johor Premium Outlets in Kulai, which is an hours drive from Singapore. Tan feels there is potential for more such factory outlets in Iskandar Malaysia, where rents will be much cheaper than in Singapore. This is similar in concept to Gotemba Premium Outlets, located outside Tokyo; and Bicester Village outside London, he says. Every business is tough, whether you are a developer or retailer, he notes. So, you must be innovative in marketing your products if you want to stand out from the crowd.

The unit is said to be facing the greenery and landed area of Amber Road and Meyer Road, according to Jamie Goh, a property agent with PropNex Realty who is marketing the unit. The apartment is said to be currently tenanted at a monthly rent of $5,500 with the lease expiring in July 2018. This translates into a gross rental yield of 2.7%. Buyers have the option to purchase the unit with tenant in place or with vacant possession, says Goh. There is an early termination clause in the lease in the event that the buyer decides to purchase with vacant possession. Monthly rents for three-bedroom units of 1,500 to 1,600 sq ft are generally hovering around $5,455, according to leasing contracts on URA for the past six months (see table). Aalto is a freehold high-end condominium on Meyer Road that was developed by Hong Leong Holdings Aalto is a freehold high-end condominium on Meyer Road that was developed by Hong Leong Holdings and completed in 2010. The project is a redevelopment of the former Eastern Mansion, which was purchased en bloc, and an adjacent site. Aalto has twin 27-storey towers and a total of 196 units. The units are three- and four-bedroom apartments sized between 1,442 sq ft and 1,959 sq ft, respectively. There are also two penthouses in the development, the larger of which is a 6,168 sq ft unit on the 26th floor that was sold for $16.8 million ($2,724 psf) in February 2011. The other penthouse of 5,608 sq ft, also on the 26th floor, fetched $16.275 million ($2,902 psf) in March 2008 at the previous peak just before the global financial crisis. The highest psf price achieved at Aalto was for one of the sub-penthouses on the 25th floor. The 3,940 sq ft unit changed hands for $11.5 million ($2,919 psf) at the last peak in February 2013. The three most recent transactions at Aalto were for four-bedroom units of 1,959 to 2,024 sq ft, which were sold at $2.9 million ($1,480 psf) to $3.4 million ($1,735 psf) in the months of July to September, according to caveats lodged with URA Realis. The latest transaction of a three-bedroom unit at Aalto was for a 1,528 sq ft, mid-floor unit, which changed hands for $2.55 million ($1,668 psf) in July. The other three transactions of three-bedroom apartments at Aalto earlier this year were also of similar-sized units. They were sold at prices ranging from $2.3 million ($1,505 psf) to $2.57 million ($1,681 psf). The last time a bigger three-bedroom unit (1,550 sq ft) changed hands was in November last year, when a unit on the 20th floor was sold for $2.73 million ($1,761 psf), according to a caveat lodged then. In the future, homebuyers can look forward to the Tanjong Katong MRT station on the Thomson-East Coast Line that is expected to open in 2023.

Earlier this year, Mrs Buxani also bought two four-bedroom units in the luxury freehold development, which was completed in 2011.Meanwhile, Spanish tycoon Ricardo Peralta continues to expand his presence in the Singapore shophouse market. He is understood to have scooped up a three-storey property with a roof terrace along Boon Tat Street for S$19 million as well as two adjoining shophouses along Amoy Street for a total of S$9.9 million. All three shophouses are on sites with 999-year leasehold tenure.The S$19 million being paid by a vehicle linked to Mr Peralta for 25 Boon Tat Street, works out to about S$3,500 per square foot on the gross floor area (GFA) of around 5,500 sq ft. The entire property is currently leased to Sum Yi Tai, a modern Chinese tapas bar. The shophouse has a land area of 1,774 sq ft.The same vehicle of Mr Peralta has inked a deal to buy 53 and 54 Amoy Street for a combined S$9.9 million - or roughly S$2,600 psf based on GFA of some 3,800 sq ft.Spanning two storeys and an attic, the two properties are currently leased as offices. Mr Peralta is seen as likely to reposition the asset for F&B use to improve yields. A few months ago, he paid S$8.2 million for the freehold 30 Stanley Street.Another recent shophouse purchase, this time by a Malaysian buyer, was 16 Smith Street. The S$8.8 million price for the three-storey with attic freehold property translates to S$2,750 psf on GFA. The entire building is currently leased to one tenant, which operates a Chinese restaurant at the ground level.Richard Tan of PropNex, who brokered the Smith Street deal, told The Business Times Weekend: \"I am seeing more foreigners and funds keenly eyeing Singapore shophouses - mainly in prime CBD areas such as Chinatown, Tanjong Pagar and the financial district.\" These investors are from Malaysia, Europe, Japan and even South Korea.\"The key attraction for foreigners to this property asset class is that it allows them ownership of the land title; foreigners are allowed to buy shophouses on sites that are fully-zoned for commercial use. Such properties are also not liable for additional buyer's stamp duty or seller's stamp duty.\"Over at Nassim Park Residences, the price being paid by Mrs Buxani for her recent penthouse purchase works out to S$3,082 psf. This is lower than the S$3,271 psf that Mr Buxani paid for a penthouse of the same size in the same block in April last year. That transaction amounted to S$22.5 million.In June this year, Mrs Buxani bought two four-bedroom apartments in the same block of the low-rise luxury condo project for S$12 million and S$12.25 million, or S$3,451 psf and S$3,523 psf respectively.She co-founded the Temptations Jewellery business in Hong Kong. It also has a presence in Singapore.Nassim Park Residences, comprising just 100 units, was developed by UOL Group, Kheng Leong and Orix Corporation. The trio roped in big-name designers - Singapore-based Chan Soo Khian of SCDA Architects, French interior designer Christian Liaigre and Japanese landscape architect Shunmyo Masuno."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Lee Kim Tah was delisted in early 2015 and Guthrie in November 2013.Most stockmarket analysts would think that a net yield of 3-plus per cent based on Guthrie and Lee Kim Tah's asking price is too low to make for a yield-accretive acquisition by Singapore mall Reits (real estate investment trusts).However, JLL regional director of Singapore capital markets Anthony Barr expects Jurong Point to appeal to a broad range of other institutional investors including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and insurance groups.\"Rarely do stabilised assets of this scale become available. There have been no comparable sales of a suburban retail property of this size on the open market for more than a decade in Singapore's tightly held retail sector; other large sales have been either related party transactions involving listed Reits or sales of partial interests.\"A high-performing mall, Jurong Point is regarded as \"fortress retail\", he added. \"This, combined with the dynamic growth planned for the Jurong district, will ensure a broad range of interest at the indicated pricing.\"Jurong Point is seamlessly linked to the Boon Lay MRT Station and Bus Interchange. It currently draws an average monthly visitorship of six million and has a catchment of 150,000 households within a five-km radius, with potential for growth as the new town planned in Tengah is progressively developed.Major tenants for the space at Jurong Point owned by Guthrie and Lee Kim Tah include FairPrice Xtra, Courts, Harvey Norman, Uniqlo and Kiddy Palace in addition to three foodcourts. Joining their ranks soon will be BHG, which will open a nearly 50,000 sq ft department store on three levels in December; part of this space was previously occupied by John Little.The mall is nearly fully let.Jurong Point stands on two sites; one has a balance lease term of about 76 years and the other, 89 years. Their combined land area is 557,288 sq ft.The original Jurong Point was completed in 1995 and spans four levels of retail space (Basement 1 to Level three). The CSFS space is on Levels 4, 5 and 6.The extension, which was completed in 2008, has three retail floors - Basement 1 and Levels 1 and 3.About 1,000 carpark lots in Jurong Point are available for use by shoppers.The mall's total gross floor area (GFA) is 1.07 million sq ft; there is no unutilised GFA."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

EL Developments preview of the 752- unit Parc Riviera on West Coast Vale over the same weekend drew more than 1,000 visitors. For the developers and their appointed marketing agents, it is now a matter of converting those footfalls into expressions of interest and, ultimately, actual units sold on the first day of launch. The balloting of units is scheduled for Nov 5, three days before the US presidential election. The start of October saw the launches of Forest Woods in Upper Serangoon and Alps Residences on Tampines Avenue 10, which are expected to translate into healthy sales for the month. Expectations are high that the level of interest seen at the two recent previews Queens Peak and Parc Riviera will translate into equally ebullient sales response for November, say analysts at DBS Vickers in their flash report on Oct 26. The advantage of Queens Peak is its cityfringe location and proximity to the Queenstown MRT station. In fact, it is going to be linked to the MRT station via an extension of the existing covered overhead bridge, says Tan Zhiyong, managing director of MCC Land. Future residents of Queens Peak will be able to access the condo via the bridge to the second level of a six-storey carpark podium, and the lift lobbies leading to their apartments. Above the car-park podium is a sky terrace that houses residents communal facilities. Sitting on top of the sky terrace and carpark podium will be the twin residential towers, with apartments spanning the eighth to 44th floors. The one- and two-bedroom units as well as the three-bedroom units are situated on the eighth to 26th floors. A sky terrace with more residents facilities will be located on the 27th floor of both towers. The more upmarket three- to five-bedroom units and five-bedroom penthouses will be housed on the 28th to 44th floors. The smaller units on the lower levels will appeal to investors as well as singles and young couples, says MCCs Tan. The premium units on the higher floors will appeal to families and owner-occupiers who want more space and panoramic views. MCC Lands Tan: We learnt from the earlier launches of these neighbouring projects, so we know how to calibrate our unit mix and prices Calibrated prices and unit sizes At Queens Peak, 62% of the units are one-bedroom, one-bedroom plus-study and two-bedroom units. The one-bedroom and one-bedroom- plus-study units are between 431 and 495 sq ft, the two-bedders are between 624 and 807 sq ft and the three-bedders are between 807 and 1,055 sq ft. The four-bedroom units are 1,507 sq ft, five-bedroom units are 2,002 sq ft and penthouses are between 4,628 and 4,768 sq ft. In terms of absolute price, the one-bedders start from $680,000, the one-bedroom-plus study units from $768,000 and the two-bedders from $966,000. Three-bedders start from $1.31 million, with half of those units priced below $1.5 million. The indicative price range is between $1,430 and 1,830 psf, with the average price at $1,630 psf. Nevertheless, Queens Peak faces stiff competition from other 99-year leasehold condominiums located in the corridor between the Redhill and Queenstown MRT stations, notes Ong Teck Hui, national director of research at JLL Singapore. These condos include Commonwealth Towers, Alex Residences,Principal GardenandThe Crest, where unsold inventory amounts to more than 1,200 units, he says. MCC Lands Tan is unfazed by the competition in the neighbourhood. We learnt from the earlier launches of these neighbouring projects, so we know how to calibrate our unit mix and prices, he says. Showflat of the living/dining area of a 1,055 sq ft, three-bedroom unit at Queens Peak Next door to Queens Peak is Commonwealth Towers, an 845-unit condo developed by City Developments Ltd (CDL). Launched in May 2014, the units were priced between $1,635 and $1,690 psf. Two years ago, absolute prices started from $721,000 for a one-bedder and $965,000 for a two-bedder. As at end-September, Commonwealth Towers achieved sales of 51%. Based on the latest caveats lodged in September and October, unit prices were from $1,621 to $1,800 psf. In terms of absolute prices, they ranged from $788,200 for a 441 sq ft one-bedder on the ninth floor to $1.3 million for a 753 sq ft two-bedder on the 31st floor. The 429-unit Alex Residences, located within walking distance of the Redhill MRT station, is more than 65% sold. As at end-September, six units were sold, and these were all above the 20th floor of the single 40-storey tower. Unit prices ranged from $1,852 to $2,109 psf. In terms of absolute prices, they ranged from $1.23 million for a 657 sq ft two-bedder on the 23rd floor to $2.04 million for a 1,044 sq ft three-bedder on the 33rd floor. Next door to Alex Residences and adjacent to the Redhill MRT station is Tang Group of Companies upcoming mixed-use development with some 400 condominium units. The project along Alexandra View is likely to be launched next year, reckons property consultants (see table). Meanwhile, at Prince Charles Crescent, off Alexandra Road, are the 663-unit Principal Garden and the 469-unit The Crest. Launched a year ago, Principal Garden was 47% sold as at end-September. Since July, the developer has been offering buyers a $5,000 discount. In September and October, units sold ranged from $800,000 for a 484 sq ft one-bedder on the seventh floor to $1.82 million for a 1,076 sq ft three-bedder. Psf prices ranged from $1,558 to $1,701, based on caveats lodged over the last two months. Source: CBRE Research Forest Woods effect Despite Queens Peak being located in Queenstown in the city fringe, and Forest Woods being located in the Upper Serangoon neighbourhood in the Outside Central Region (OCR), people will still compare the two projects by virtue of the timing of their launches, says Desmond Sim, head of CBRE Research for Singapore and Southeast Asia. At Forest Woods, 337 out of 519 units, or 65%, were sold on the first day of launch on Oct 8. Alps Residences, which held its launch one week earlier, on Oct 2, saw 280 units out of a total of 626 (45%) sold on the first day. The Upper Serangoon stretch where Forest Woods is located has more affordable prices ($1,400 psf on average) compared with the Queenstown-Redhill corridor, where average prices are in the $1,600-to-$1,750 psf range, notes JLLs Ong. Ultimately, sales will depend on pricing and market sentiment, he adds. CBREs Sim reckons that buyers at Queens Peak are likely to zoom in on the one- and two-bedroom units. As these make up 62% of the units in the project, he expects the response to be similar to that at Forest Woods. Affordable pricing Parc Rivierais also looking at a similar strategy, says CBREs Sim. Nowadays, the success rate of new launches is dependent on absolute prices. The project contains 120 one-bedders of 463 sq ft, 136 two-bedders of 603 sq ft and 196 premium two-bedders of 646 to 710 sq ft. They make up 60% of the units in the project. One-bedders are likely to be priced from about $570,000. Lim Yew Soon, managing director of niche developer EL Development, is of the same view. The main draw these days is the one and two-bedroom units because the pricing is palatable to most buyers, he says. We will definitely need to conduct sales by balloting for the one- and two-bedroom units. A scale model of the 752-unitParc Riviera, whose launch last weekend saw more than 1,000 visitors The last launch in the West Coast vicinity of Parc Riviera was the 210-unit Waterfront at Faber by World Class Land. Launched in May 2014, the project is fully sold at an average price of close to $1,200 psf, says JLLs Ong. Given the lack of new supply and limited competition in the area, Parc Riviera should be able to attract buyers if it is realistically priced. EL Development paid $314.1 million ($551 psf per plot ratio) for the Parc Riviera site in August last year. A requirement for the development of the site is the use of prefabricated, prefinished volumetric construction method. The main attraction of Parc Riviera will be its height, notes EL Developments Lim. At 36 storeys, it will dwarf the existing private condos in the neighbouring West Coast Park, such as Botannia and The Infiniti, which are both 12 storeys high. From the 10th floor of our project, you will have unobstructed views of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, says Lim. The site adjacent to Parc Riviera is also a government land parcel. It has not been launched for sale yet. Showflat of aParc Rivierapenthouse with 4.4m ceiling height The existing developments on West Coast Park feature larger units, with two-bedroom units above 800 sq ft. One such condo is the 493-unit Botannia, developed by CDL and completed in 2009. The most recent transactions at the 956-year leasehold project were at $1,099 to $1,202 psf, according to caveats lodged in August and September. In terms of absolute price, units sold ranged from $1.36 million for a 1,238 sq ft, three-bedroom unit to $1.82 million for a 1,572 sq ft, four-bedroom unit. The 315-unit Infiniti, completed in 2008, is a freehold condo by Frasers Centrepoint. The most recent transaction there was for a 915 sq ft, two-bedroom unit that was sold for $950,000 ($1,038 psf) in May. West Coast, Jurong appeal According to EL Developments Lim, units will be priced from below $1,000 psf to $1,400 psf, with an average price of $1,250 psf. Many buyers comment that units in new projects today are small but were trying to keep them affordable, he says. However, we will try to make sure that the common bedrooms can fit a single bed and a small side table or a queensized bed. Another attraction of the site is that the Pandan River is located next to it, and it is just a five-minute drive to Jurong East Central or Jurong Gateway, the upcoming Second CBD, says Lim. Although there is no MRT station nearby at the moment, there are bus stops at Ayer Rajah Expressway, with both the Clementi and Jurong East MRT stations just a short bus ride away. In the future, there will be a new West Coast Extension to the Jurong Regional Line. This could see more MRT stations in the West Coast area, with a possible link to Haw Par Villa MRT station on the Circle Line. This year saw the launch of MCL Lands Lake Grande in Jurong West. The 710-unit project was launched for sale the weekend after the governments of Singapore and Malaysia signed a memorandum of understanding on the Kuala Lumpur- Singapore High Speed Rail in July. A total of 436 of the 500 units released were sold in the first weekend at an average price of $1,368 psf. At Lake Grande, it was also the smaller units the one- and two-bedders that found favour with buyers. As at end-September, the project was 73% sold, at a median price of $1,312 psf. Lim: The main draw these days is the one- and two-bedroom units because the pricing is palatable to buyers Recovery underway? With 2016 bookended by the launch of Queens Peak and Parc Riviera, Christine Li, head of research at Cushman & Wakefield, is projecting new home sales to ring in at 7,500 to 8,000 units, which is higher than the sales figures for 2015 (7,440 units) and 2014 (7,316 units). The recent spate of bond defaults has led investors to divert funds back into the real-estate market, says Li. Recent figures have indicated a stabilising residential market, and people waiting on the sidelines are coming back to take advantage of low borrowing rates due to the delayed Fed rate hike. As at end-3Q2016, URA data points to unsold inventory of 21,000 units, which is a historical low. But that does not mean property prices are going to rebound, says CBREs Sim. Based on the 3Q2016 advance estimates, the private property price index is down 10.8% from the peak of 2Q2013. The Core Central Region (CCR) has seen prices fall 10% year to date, the Rest of Central Region (RCR) has seen a 10.8% drop and the Outside Central Region (OCR), a correction of 9.5%. However, due to the weak leasing market and supply overhang in the RCR and OCR, prices will continue to moderate in the next few quarters, given the slowing of the economy, says Cushman & Wakefields Li. According to Nomura in its Oct 20 report on the Singapore property market, overall unsold inventory represents 35 months of demand. In the suburbs, it is 25 months. While that is low compared with the peak in 2014 (46 months and 35 months respectively), Nomura analysts Sai Min Chow and Royston Tan say the level is still high compared with the average of 30 months and 22 months respectively for the 2009-to-2015 period. The vacancy rate in Singapores private housing market crossed 10% in 2Q2016, and hit 10.4% when 30,000 new homes were completed in 2015 and 1H2016. Nomura analysts estimate another 30,000 units will be completed from 2H2016 to 2017, with 50% in the prime and city-fringe locations. While the residential market appears to be bottoming, CBREs Sim expects a prolonged U-shaped recovery rather than a V-shaped recovery. We are nearing the trough, he says.

He had purchased the 1,130 sq ft unit from the developer in September 2010 at $1,897 psf and resold it at $1.62 million, or $1,433 psf, on Oct 13. The annualised loss works out to 5%. All resale transactions at the project since 2015, where the previous caveats can be traced, have been unprofitable. The biggest loss recorded in the project was from a 1,808 sq ft unit, which incurred a loss of $1.44 million in March this year. Jardin is a 140-unit freehold condominium on Dunearn Road near Bukit Timah Plaza that was completed in 2012. A 1,130 sq ft unit at Jardin was sold at a loss of $524,250 on Oct 13 Over at Cyan, a freehold condo in prime District 10, a 1,658 sq ft unit was sold at a loss of $497,000 on Oct 13. The seller paid the developer $2,472 psf for the unit in September 2010, a price in the top 3% at the project historically. The unit was resold at $3.6 million, or $2,172 psf. In November 2015, another 1,658 sq ft unit at the project was resold at $1,872 psf. The transaction resulted in a loss of $935,000 for the seller, the biggest loss recorded in the project. Of the four transactions concluded at the project so far this year, two were profitable. The top gain of $3.27 million in the week of Oct 11 to 18 accrued to a 3,111 sq ft unit on the 22nd floor of Yong An Park, a 288-unit freehold condo on River Valley Road in prime District 9. The unit was held for nearly 18 years before it was resold at $5.2 million, or $1,672 psf. It was previously purchased in February 1999 at $620 psf. The annualised gain works out to 6%. This marks the second profitable deal at the project this year. In September, a 1,023 sq ft unit on the second floor netted a $265,000 profit after being held for seven years. Separately, in the landed housing segment, a terraced house on Charlton Lane fetched a toppish $3.1 million, or $2,035 psf on land area, on Oct 18 after being held for slightly over a year. The transaction reflects an 88% gain, or $1.45 million. The seller had purchased the property at just $1.65 million, or $1,083 psf, last year. The property sits on a 1,528 sq ft freehold plot. Including a sellers stamp duty of $372,000 payable, the profit works out to $1.08 million. This is the first landed house on Charlton Lane that crossed the $2,000 psf mark. The hefty price gain, however, may be partly attributed to the ongoing refurbishment of the property into a three-storey house with an attic and basement. Meanwhile, two 99-year leasehold, strata-terraced house in The Shaughnessy in Yishun found buyers in the week of Oct 11 to 18. The bigger profit of $554,340 accrued a 3,283 sq ft terraced house that was purchased more than a decade ago, in November 2005, at $242 psf. The unit was resold at $1.35 million, or $411 psf, on Oct 12, for an annualised gain of 5%. The smaller profit amounted to $130,000, or an annualised gain of 1% over eight years. The seller, who purchased the property in May 2008 at $368 psf, resold it at $1.35 million, or $407 psf, on Oct 14. Only four of the 182 resale transactions at The Shaughnessy so far this year, where the previous caveats could be traced, were unprofitable. The four properties were purchased in 2011 and 2012 from the resale market. Only one property purchased between 2011 and 2012 was resold at a profit, which amounted to $50,000.

The total sales value of conservation shophouses that changed hands tripled from $59.92 million in 1Q2016 to $182.54 million in 2Q2016, and rose a further 14.7% to $209.32 million in 3Q2016. Driving this demand were boutique funds, family offices and foreign high-net-worth individuals looking for alternative investment asset classes that are safe havens amid global economic uncertainty. The biggest deal in 2016 so far was the $81.4 million purchase of a portfolio of seven shophouses by boutique property fund 8M Real Estate from veteran international property investor Stanley Quek. The deal was conducted in April and comprised five shophouses at 15-23 Tanjong Pagar Road for $57.40 million; the shophouse at 18 Genmill Lane for $11 million; and 71 Neil Road for $13 million. This row of shophouses on Tanjong Pagar Road changed hands for $57.40 million Who are the buyers? Set up in 2014,8M Real Estateis said to have acquired 15 shophouses worth $200 million over the past two years. These include 37 Craig Road, which it acquired in April for $6.5 million; 31 Hong Kong Street, purchased in July for $14.45 million; and 22 Genmill Lane, which it picked up for $14.25 million in October 2014. Its maiden acquisition was a row of five shophouses at 112 to 116 Amoy Street, for which it paid $50 million two years ago. In addition to boutique property funds, shophouses have attracted even foreign billionaires such as Ricardo Portabella Peralta, CEO of Luxembourg-based Ventos, which invests in companies involved in the real estate, food processing, venture capital, financial holdings, energy and environment industries. Ventos has operations in Europe, North America and Asia. Peralta is said to have purchased five shophouses in a period of just 12 months. The spending spree started with the acquisition of two adjoining shophouses at 120 and 122 Telok Ayer Street for $18.2 million in October 2015, followed by two more shophouses at 20 and 37 Duxton Road for $13.7 million a month later, and a shophouse at 7 Craig Road for $12.5 million last December. In March this year, he paid $20.25 million for a three-storey shophouse at 83 Amoy Street. The Leong family that started the Axe Brand medicated oil is said to have paid $25 million for two shophouses on Bukit Pasoh Road in Chinatown in September. And the family that owns Hong Kong-based developer Wincome Group is said to have acquired three adjacent shophouses in Joo Chiat for $23 million last December. Heritage value Conservationshophousesare attractive investments, owing to their heritage value. Built from the early 1800s to early 1900s, these shophouses are generally two to three storeys high and formed much of the pre-war urban fabric of Singapores old city centre and other parts of the island. Rapid urbanisation has resulted in many of these shophouses being torn down to make way for skyscrapers. Today, only 6,500 have survived, and they have been gazetted for conservation by URA. Owing to the limited supply, conservation shophouss offer good capital appreciation potential over the long term. This has resulted in some extraordinary gains for investors. For instance, the five conservation shophouses on Amoy Street that were purchased for $34.43 million in June 2011 changed hands for $50 million in 2014 when 8M purchased them. This means a capital appreciation of 45.2% over a three-year period. Likewise, 7 Craig Road was purchased for $12.5 million in December last year by Peralta. Prior to that, the unit traded for $7.88 million in May 2013. Investors can further unlock the value of their shophouses by repositioning the asset, changing the trade mix or refurbishing the interiors. Some shophouses also offer development opportunity via a multi-storey extension in the rear. Steady income stream Conservation shophouses have the potential to generate a steady income stream for investors as they are supported by healthy leasing demand. Ground-floor shophouses that have prominent frontage are sought after by niche retailers and F&B operators. The upper floors of these shophouses tend to attract people in the creative industries, such as architectural firms and interior design and startup companies. In recent years, conservation shophouses have also drawn buyers as they are not subject to additional buyers and sellers stamp duties. This year saw more owners willing to put their properties on the market, which contributed to the flurry of activity. However, before buying a conservation shophouse, investors should do their homework and study the conservation, planning and development guidelines of the area in which the property is located.

The site sits adjacent to the Queenstown MRT station, and the developer will have a direct link from the overhead bridge of the station to Queens Peak, says MCC Land, the project manager. According to property agents, the launch of Queens Peak has stirred interest in neighbouring projects with unsold units, especially the Commonwealth-Alexandra neighbourhood between the Queenstown and Redhill MRT stations. The crowd at Queens Peak on balloting day on Nov 5 Next door to Queens Peak is Commonwealth Towers, an 845-unit, 43-storey twin tower project by Hong Leong Holdings.

Units at Principal Garden sold in October ranged from $1,574 psf for a four-bedroom fourth-floor unit to $1,730 psf for a 797 sq ft, two-bedroom unit. Based on caveats lodged as at Nov 1, 326 units, or 49% out of a total of 663, had been sold. The project is jointly developed by UOL Group and Kheng Leong Co.

The 18th-floor unit fetched $2.1 million, or $1,016 psf, on Nov 2, more than double its purchase price of $454 psf in February 2006. This translates to an 8% annualised gain for the seller, who had held the unit for close to 11 years. Over at The Chuan, a 106-unit condo project near Lorong Chuan MRT station in Serangoon, a 1,281 sq ft unit was sold at a profit of $717,000 in the same week. The seller, who purchased the unit from the developer at $783 psf in May 2007, made an annualised gain of 6% from the sale, which fetched $1.7 million, or $1,343 psf. Kensington Park was completed in 1990 while The Chuan was completed in 2007. Both projects hold a 999-year leasehold tenure. An 18th-floor unit in Kensington Park Condominium was resold at $1.2 million profit on Nov 2 The biggest loss incurred in the week accrued to a 2,626 sq ft unit at CityVista Residences, a 70-unit freehold condo in prime district 9. The seller, who paid the developer $2,488 psf for the unit in August 2007 and resold it at $5.2 million or $2,000 psf on Nov 3, suffered a loss of $1.3 million. There have been four resale transactions at the project to- date. All four sellers had purchased their units from the developer, but at different periods. The two who purchased in 2007, when prices averaged $2,584 psf, suffered losses while the other two who bought their units in 2010, when the average price fell to $1,785 psf, made profits in the resale market. CityVista Residences on Peck Hay Road was completed in 2010. In the landed housing segment, two sellers reaped profits of over a million dollars from the sale of their semi-detached houses. The bigger profit of $2.1 million accrued to a property on Boscombe Road off Tanjong Katong Road, which sold at $3.6 million or $1,509 psf on land area on Nov 3. The property sits on a 2,390 sq ft site and was previously purchased at $636 psf in October 2004. This reflects an annualised gain of 7% over 12 years. The computed price gain for landed properties, however, excludes any renovation or refurbishment costs incurred by the seller. The smaller profit of $1.6 million was from a semi-detached house on Eng Kong Crescent. It has a land area of 3,305 sq ft and changed hands at $3.5 million, or $1,047 psf, on land area on Nov 7, almost double its purchase price of $554 psf in February 2008. The annualised gain works out to 8%. At Dunearn Estate in prime district 11, a detached house a on Berrima Road was sold at a loss of $920,000 in the week. The property, which was purchased in October 2012 at $1,705 psf over a land area of 5,576 sq ft, was disposed four years later on Nov 4 at $1,540 psf.

In July, a detached house with a land area of 4,941 sq ft was sold at a loss of $538,000.

About 40% ofDUOs office space has been leased and 95% of its 660 residential units have been sold Properties on the market With DUOs greater visibility as it nears completion, some owners of neighbouring buildings are taking the opportunity to put their properties on the market. An example is trading firm Geetex Group, the owner of Bugis Point, which put up the property for sale by tender at end-September. The propertys indicative price is $59.5 million ($3,505 psf), according to CBREs Lim, who is marketing the property. The tender closed on Nov 9, and the owner is said to be reviewing the offers received. Bugis Point is located at the junction of North Bridge Road and Tan Queen Lan Street. It is a six-storey building with a built-up area of 16,975 sq ft that sits on a 999-year leasehold site of 2,776 sq ft. Bugis Point is currently leased to the Club Jwels karaoke lounge on the upper floors, with the ground floor tenanted by two F&B outlets, Ah Seng Bak Kut Teh and Blanco Court Beef Noodles. Located across the road from Bugis Point is the Bugis Junction mall, one of the most successful shopping malls in the portfolio of CapitaLand Mall Trust. The mall is linked directly to the Bugis MRT interchange station in the basement, and via an overhead bridge to Bugis+. Together, the two malls have a combined NLA of more than 600,000 sq ft. Bugis Junction is also part of a mixed-use develop ment and is linked to InterContinental Hotel and the Bugis Junction Tower office block. Bugis Point, located next to Wisma Alsagoff, has been put up for sale at an indicative price of $59.5 million The Bugis area has one of the highest footfalls outside of Orchard Road, which is why it is a magnet for investors looking for commercial properties to invest in, says Savills Cheong. However, not all buildings bene- fit from the high footfalls. Just one street away from Bugis Junction and a few doors from Bugis Point is the strata-titled commercial development Bugis Cube. Formerly known as North Bridge Commercial Complex, it was converted into a strata- titled mixed-use development with 122 units of retail and office space for sale. The six-storey buildings extensive refurbishment was completed in 2013. However, most of the investors who bought units at Bugis Cube struggled to find tenants for the better part of the first 18 months after it was completed. This was because many of them, whose units were on the upper floors, had asking rents of more than $10 psf per month, says Jason Low, a senior division director with ERA Realty. Bugis Cube is a 122-unit, 999-year leasehold development that Gryphon Estate Management completed in 2013 The units are now filling up because some of the owners have lowered their rents, he adds. However, their yields have been affected as a result. For example, a 334 sq ft unit on the third level was sold for $1.6 million during the launch. It is currently being rented out for $2,500 a month ($7.50 psf per month), giving the owner a yield of around 2% a year, which is not even enough to break even after deducting the mortgage payment, says ERAs Low. The highest rent achieved at Bugis Cube was for a 1,356 sq ft unit on the ground floor, which has been leased to an F&B outlet for $24,000 a month ($17.70 psf a month). The owner paid $9.35 million ($6,899 psf) for the unit when it was launched in 2012. The latest transaction at Bugis Cube was for a 301 sq ft unit on the second level that changed hands for $1.03 million ($3,417 psf) in August 2015. RediscoverBugisToday! #FINDYOURSPOT in our beloved city island Units for lease The Prospex is another building that had undergone extensive refurbishment works, which were completed in 2015. The nine-storey commercial building is located at the corner of Victoria Street and Middle Road, and adjacent to Bugis+. The owner of The Prospex Hong Kong- and Singapore-focused real-estate private- equity firm Pamfleet Group had originally offered office units for sale on a strata basis. It subsequently offered the entire building for en bloc purchase with a price tag of $80 million last year. The commercial units in The Prospex are now available for lease, though. Asking rents for the office units range from $8 psf per month for a 581 sq ft unit to $7.20 psf per month for a 3,800 sq ft unit, according to listings by agents. More than 80% of the building has been leased so far. The retail space was put up for lease earlier this year, with asking rents of $17.50 psf per month. The Prospex is no longer for sale, but it is available for lease; 80% of its space has already been taken up Coveted shophouses on Tan Quee Lan, Liang Seah Streets There is keen interest from investors eyeing the wide array of assets at Bugis, says CBREs Lim. Some of these assets, including the limited stock of conservation shophouses, are highly prized. The most coveted conservation shophouses are those on Tan Quee Lan and Liang Seah Streets. However, very few of these are available for sale as they are held by family trusts. These shophouse owners are also hoping that with the completion of DUO, the whole Bugis area will be rejuvenated, says ERAs Low. Most of the shophouses on Tan Quee Lan and Liang Seah Streets are zoned for commercial use. However, some of the owners have converted the upper floors from office space into apartments for lease. Liang Seah Street has a wide array of eateries such as Beavers Pub & Grill, Arirang Korean Restaurant, Thai Mookata and Chinese hotpot At Liang Seah Place, for instance, the upper floors of shophouses, which were originally offices, have been converted into one- and two-bedroom apartments of 800 to 1,400 sq ft. They are offered for lease at $3,300 to $4,350 a month. Meanwhile, at Liang Seah Court, a row of four adjoining conservation shophouses of 999-year lease, the upper floors have been converted into 10 strata-titled apartments. The last transaction of an apartment at Liang Seah Court was for a 1,206 sq ft, two-bedder on the third floor that fetched $1.7 million ($1,425 psf) in August 2012, according to a caveat lodged with URA Realis. Prior to that, the unit had changed hands for $1.2 million ($995 psf) in August 2007. A 1,206 sq ft, two-bedroom unit on the third floor of the 999-year leasehold Liang Seah Court was sold in August 2012 for $1.7 million ($1,425 psf) Heritage Place is made up of a row of 11 adjoining conservation shophouses whose upper floors have been converted into 21 strata-titled apartments. The last time a unit changed hands there was also in August 2012, when a 1,851 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the fifth level was sold for $2.4 million ($1,286 psf). The unit was previously sold in February 2006 for $1.1 million ($589 psf). On the market is a 980 sq ft, two-bedder with a price tag of $1.7 million ($1,735 psf). Tan Quee Lan Suites is also a row of 999-year leasehold conservation shophouses converted into 30 apartments for lease a decade ago. According to recent listings, 820 sq ft, two-bedders are available for lease at $3,720 a month, while 1,216 sq ft two-bedders are available at $5,472 a month. The last time a unit at the 999-year leasehold Heritage Place changed hands was in August 2012 Impact on rents, yields Although South Beach and DUO are likely to inject new life into Bugis and attract new businesses to the area, Edmund Tie & Cos head of research for South-east Asia, Lee Nai Jia, says the global downturn is having a negative impact on rents and therefore on the yields of some of these properties, particularly the shophouses on Liang Seah and Tan Queen Lan Streets. Rents for office space and apartments on the upper floors of these shophouses range from $4.20 to $4.70 psf per month. Meanwhile, commercial units leased out to F&B outlets on the ground floor command rents of $19 psf per month. Therefore, Lee estimates rental yields for conservation shophouses at 2% to 3%. Despite the relatively low yields, investor interest in such assets remains strong, notes CBREs Lim. Property funds, family offices and high-net-worth individuals are on the lookout for the opportunity to acquire these income-producing assets, priced at a palatable quantum, in the hope of future capital appreciation, she says.

Tenders closed on Nov 2.The Cuscaden Walk property, sold for S$103.8 million to SL Capital (2) Pte Ltd, a consortium led by Sustained Land Pte Ltd, has a land area of 21,560 square feet and is zoned \"residential\" with a gross plot ratio (GPR) of 2.8 under the 2014 Master Plan.The sale price reflects a land rate of about S$1,826 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) on the potential gross floor area, including an estimated development charge of S$6.43 million payable upon redevelopment.A subsidiary of Roxy-Pacific Holdings bought the Grange Road development for S$48.5 million. It comprises an 11-storey block of 18 flats with a total strata area of 26,350 square feet, sited on a land area of 15,780 square feet.Also zoned \"residential\", it has a GPR of 2.1 under the 2014 Master Plan and works out to S$1,841 psf on the existing strata area.The Hullet Road property, the smallest among the three with a land area of 10,733 square feet, went to Hullet Development Pte Ltd, a consortium led by Patrick Kho of Lian Huat Group, for S$38.2 million, which works out to S$2,073 psf.Built in the early 2000s, it comprises a 10-storey block of 18 apartments with a total strata area of 18,428 square feet.Jeremy Lake, executive director of investment properties at CBRE Singapore, said Hullet Development intends to build an exclusive high-end development given the location of the property, which is in the heart of Orchard Road.\"Sentiment towards the prime residential market has improved since the middle of the year and some developers have been asking if there are sites for sale. These three sites are very well located which combined with their palatable deal sizes resulted in a very competitive bidding process,\" he said.Karamjit Singh, international director and head of residential at JLL, said the properties attracted interest from a wide variety of parties including long-term investors and those looking to build serviced apartments and \"reflect an underlying confidence in the stability of the high-end residential market which, prior to this year, saw a steady decline in values over the preceding four years\".In addition, the vendor has also engaged property consultancy JLL to market for sale two apartments that it owns at The Claymore by private treaty. The sizes of the apartments are 2,680 square feet and 3,348 square feet respectively.The tender exercise was managed jointly by JLL and CBRE on behalf of the vendors, who were seeking offers for the three buildings individually or as one lot."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The property exhibition was held at Fairmont Singapore in Raffles City. So far, 180 units have been booked, says GSH. The figure includes the 150 units taken up when the first phase of 280 units was launched in KL on Sept 20, and the units sold subsequently. These days, its hard to achieve double-digit sales in any overseas property launch, observes Donald Han, managing director of Chesterton Singapore. With the Singapore economy in the doldrums, people are conserving cash. Meanwhile, companies are trying to cut costs. So, in the current environment, if you can achieve such sales at an overseas project launch, thats excellent. Over the weekend, more than 20 groups were said to have visited the exhibition. For a standalone overseas project exhibition, its quite a good turnout, says Sunny Wong, division director at ERA Realty, the exclusive marketing agent for the project. These are serious buyers. Some are interested in buying a unit as a second home and others are looking at an investment opportunity. Riding on the momentum, Eaton Residences will be showcased for a second consecutive weekend in Singapore at ERAs office and sales gallery in Mountbatten Square on Nov 26 and 27. Petronas Twin Towers the landmark of Kuala Lumpur City Centre Palatable absolute prices With the Malaysian ringgit tumbling to a new low of 3.1 against the Singapore dollar, the exchange rate is looking favourable for Singaporeans, and in terms of absolute prices, its equivalent to a 30% to 40% discount, says Gilbert Ee, CEO of GSH. To make absolute prices palatable to price-sensitive buyers, one-bedroom and one-bedroom- plus-study units make up 394 (62%) of a total of 632 units at Eaton Residences. These are sized from 635 to 872 sq ft. Two-bedroom-plus-study units measuring 1,098 to 1,464 sq ft and three- and four-bedroom-plus-study units measuring 1,550 to 2,874 sq ft account for 36% of the units. There are also 12 penthouses of 2,271 to 2,982 sq ft. The one-bedroom units at Eaton Residences are priced from RM1.14 million ($365,000) and one-bedroom-plus-study units start from RM1.45 million ($465,000). Therefore, these units have been the most appealing to investors because of the affordability of their absolute prices. For $365,000 to $465,000, you cannot even buy a shoebox apartment in Singapore today, says a property agent. At that price range, you can probably buy a brand-new BMW 6 Series convertible, a Jaguar F-Type, a Mercedes CLS-Class or a Porsche Boxster in Singapore. But if you buy a property, you can rent it out and earn a return, says Ee. Ee: The [SGD/RM] exchange rate at this point is looking favourable for Singaporeans, and in terms of absolute prices, its equivalent to a 30% to 40% discount Rental yields Contrary to popular belief, it is easier to find tenants in KL than in Singapore, says Bruce Lye, managing partner of realtor SRI. Lye, a Singaporean, has been marketing projects in KL and investing there for the past six years. Today, he and his wife jointly own seven condo units in KL three in the MontKiara area, a popular suburb with expatriates; two at Sentral Residences near the KL Sentral train station, which is due for completion within the next few months; one in KLCC; and one in Bukit Bintang. Based on my experience with the properties that I own there, I realise that the big units in the KLCC area do not perform as well in terms of rentability compared with those in MontKiara, says Lye. The big units in MontKiara tend to be rented out quickly because they are popular with families, as there are international schools in the neighbourhood. In the KLCC area, one- and two-bedroom units are sought after because of the profile of the tenants, says Lye. They tend to be young singles or couples with no children. In fact, rents of the larger units are quite close to the one- and two-bedroom units in the KLCC area. According to Lye, gross rental yields in the MontKiara and KLCC area are about 6%. If one were to take financing cost into consideration, however, then net yield would be 2% to 3%, which is on a par with yields in Singapore, he says. Without a mortgage, however, yields will be around 6%. Reinvesting, dollar cost averaging While Lyes portfolio of properties have seen capital gains, he will incur a loss based on the current exchange rate. This is because many of his purchases were made five to six years ago when the ringgit was 2.2 against the Singapore dollar, says Lye. One way to avoid a currency exchange loss is to reinvest his gains in Malaysia, he says. Thus, he intends to buy another small one- or two-bedroom unit in the KLCC area within the next six months. Another bonus of having multiple properties in KL is that it can also be a second or holiday home. I travel up to KL at least once a month, says Lye. If one of my properties is available between tenants, I will stay in it. While Singaporeans account for about 20% of buyers at Eaton Residences, mainland Chinese form the majority. Other international buyers include those from Hong Kong, Indonesia and Taiwan, says GSHs Ee. Model of the 632-unit Eaton Residences on Jalan Kia Peng in KLCC In early November, the Hong Kong government doubled stamp duty for foreign buyers from 15% to 30%, and for second and subsequent Hong Kong resident buyers from 8.5% to 15%. Anticipating that property investors will now look elsewhere, Singapore developers have been quick to seize the opportunity by bringing their projects to Hong Kong on roadshows. Like the other Singapore developers, GSH is also launching Eaton Residences at a weekend roadshow in Hong Kong on Nov 26 and 27. If the overseas and local investors in Hong Kong are deterred by the higher stamp duty, money will flow out and look to invest elsewhere, says Ee. KL may be at the receiving end of some of that outflow. The downward trend of the ringgit is a double-edged sword for many overseas investors. I remember 25 years ago when the exchange rate between the ringgit and Singapore dollar was 1.5 to 1, recounts Chestertons Han. And now its hovering at 3.1 to 1. So, its been on a downward trend. And in the short term and even the medium term, its hard to foresee the ringgit strengthening, especially with oil prices still depressed and the current political uncertainty in Malaysia. Priced at RM1,550 to RM1,800 psf, Eaton Residences looks particularly compelling, especially in the face of a falling ringgit, concedes Han. In the KLCC area, ultra-luxury condos priced at RM2,500 to RM3,000 psf are finding it difficult to move units, especially if they are large and the absolute prices are high. He reckons that GSHs Eaton Residences could have hit the sweet spot with foreign buyers with the exclusivity of the project, and by capitalising on its location and the views. Every room in every unit from the kitchen and living area to the master bedroom has a view Capitalising on views, location Eaton Residences is located within KLs Embassy Row and near the Petronas Twin Towers and Jalan Bukit Bintang shopping belt. It is within walking distance of the KLCC LRT station and within 150m of a future MRT station at Jalan Conlay. The project is also near the Prince Court Medical Centre. The 51-storey tower offers unobstructed panoramic views of the Petronas Twin Towers on one side and the Royal Selangor Golf Club on the other. GSH had purchased the prime 62,726.4 sq ft site from Tropicana Kia Peng for RM132.4 million in December 2013. The 99-year lease on the project is not a concern, says Ee. Unlike in Singapore, owners of private property in Malaysia are able to renew their 99-year lease at a prescribed amount. And buyers only need to pay to renew the lease when there are only 30 years left, he says. GSH has appointed Singapores most established architectural firm, Swan & Maclaren, to design Eaton Residences in collaboration with Patty Mak (formerly of Suying Metropolitan Studio) as interior design consultant. Eaton Residences will have an entrance driveway and lobby designed with the grandeur of a luxury hotel, says Lim Chai Boon, Swan & Maclarens group director. There are three levels of basement parking below an eight-storey car-park podium. Ample parking is provided, as the one-bedroom units are designated one parking space each, but most of the other units have two parking spaces each and the penthouses have up to four. On the rooftop of the car-park podium, there is a facilities deck with a childrens playground, barbeque pods, fitness stations and multi-use spaces. The 33rd level has a sky garden and lounge. The 51st level has a 40m cantilevered infinity swimming pool that allows residents to enjoy the view, says Lim. There are also spa pools and a leisure pool on this level. The view from the 51st floor will be as spectacular as being at the SkyPark of Marina Bay Sands, says GSHs Ee. This is whats going to set the project apart from the rest. And there are many upcoming developments in the vicinity. According to Property Talk & Lifestyle Malaysias PTML Research in a September 2015 report, more than 120 sites in the KL city area are under construction, being proposed for development or being planned for future development. KL is a city of skyscrapers, and thats no different from other cities such as Shanghai or Manhattan, notes interior designer Doyenne Mak. I felt it was important to create an identity for Eaton Residences. We wanted to create city living, and that means embracing the skyline so, every room in every unit must have a view. All units have an open-concept kitchen, says Mak. This allows residents to interact with other members of the family even while cooking, and enjoy the view at the same time. At Eaton Residences, Mak also chose a muted palette for the units, with the same white marble carried throughout the unit and in the bathrooms, and white timber flooring for the bedrooms. Kitchen cabinets and wardrobes, which are custom-designed, are also in white or grey tones. The idea is to create a canvas for the owner to fill in the colours to complete their dream home against the backdrop of a blue sky, she says. Every unit at Eaton Residences comes with an open-kitchen concept with a view of the city skyline Luxury quality for a steal The quality of the materials used at Eaton Residences is equivalent to those of luxury condos in the prime districts of Singapore. Mak has designed the interiors of many high-end condos in Singapore, including the 462-unit OUE Twin Peaks on Leonie Hill Road, where she even handpicked the furniture for each unit; Allgreen Properties 360-unit SkySuites @ Anson on Enggor Street; Sing Holdings 134-unit Robin Residences; and the 97-unit Centennia Suites, where action star Jackie Chan is said to have purchased three units. With Swan & Maclaren and Mak behind the design of Eaton Residences, the response to our project has been very good, says Ee. Despite the challenging environment, we swung quite a few buyers from neighbouring projects because of our price point, product quality and uniqueness. The construction cost of Eaton Residences is estimated at RM450 million, and the condo is expected to be completed in 2020. I dont think I can construct a 51-storey condo project of this quality in Singapore for $150 million, says Ee. Even if the ringgit collapses further, property prices in Malaysia will have to go up because developers can no longer build properties at these prices, he adds. The cost of labour and construction materials will only go up, and that means property prices will also rise. So, if youre buying a unit at below RM2,000 psf in KLCC today, there will be upside potential.

Bordered by Sims Drive and Aljunied Road, the project will be the largest private condo in the Aljunied area when it is completed in 1Q2019. When completed, Sims Urban Oasis could just be the catalyst needed to revitalise the area, which is largely made up of ageing HDB blocks, says Alice Tan, head of research at Frank Singapore. GuocoLand had purchased the site in a government land tender for $530.9 million (about $688 psf per plot ratio) in April 2014. Launched in February 2015, Sims Urban Oasis is about 59% sold to date. When completed, it will have eight 18- storey blocks sitting on a sprawling site of 257,260 sq ft. Units range from one-bedders of 409 sq ft to five-bedroom units of 1,722 sq ft. On the grounds are also six retail units sized at 232 to 517 sq ft. There is also a 3,254 sq ft space designated for a childcare centre. However, the retail and childcare centre units have not been launched for sale yet. View of the Geylang East and Aljunied area with Central Grove on the left, TRE Residences on the right,Sims Urban Oasisin the background and Geylang Methodist Primary and Secondary schools in the centre Steady sales The most recent caveats lodged were for six units in November, which were sold at prices ranging from $726,000 ($1,498 psf) for a 484 sq ft one-bedder to $1.37 million ($1,325 psf) for a 1,033 sq ft three-bedder. Average sales of four to five units each week are encouraging in the current environment of uncertainty and economic slowdown, says Knight Franks Tan. She attributes that to realistic pricing by the developer. Sales generally picks up when a project approaches completion, hence, Sims Urban Oasis is likely to see an uplift in sales in late 2018 to early 2019, says Alan Cheong, head of research at Savills Singapore. After all, about 70% of the buyers are said to be owner-occupiers, with investors making up the balance. Singaporeans form the majority of the buyers (75%), with foreigners accounting for 25%. With its spacious grounds, ample amenities and different zones for families with children and those who want more exclusivity, the project caters to owner-occupiers of different profiles, says Richard Lin, director of ERA Realty. As such, many of the one-bedroom units have also been purchased by singles and young couples for their own use, he adds. The eight towers atSims Urban Oasishave reached their maximum 18 storeys. Construction is expected to be completed by 1Q2019. Gentrification underway The neighbourhood around Sims Urban Oasis is also slowly being gentrified. Just next to Sims Urban Oasis are three old HDB blocks that have been earmarked for the selective en bloc redevelopment scheme (SERS). The residents in the old blocks have been relocated to Greentops @ Sims Place, a new HDB block that was completed last year. The three blocks of vacated, old HDB flats next to Sims Urban Oasis, which have been taken back by HDB The SERS site could resurface in the govern ment land sales programme as a private residential development site, reckons ERAs Lin. This will further rejuvenate the neighbourhood, especially when the new private condos attract younger families with children to move in, he adds. New businesses will also be drawn to the area. For instance, the new James Cook University campus on Sims Drive opened early last year and has an enrolment of 3,400 students. This will certainly bring a younger set to the neighbourhood, as well as draw families with teenaged children, notes Knight Franks Tan. While Sims Urban Oasis may be the largest private condo project in the pipeline for completion, it is not the only one in the Aljunied area. Located adjacent to the Aljunied MRT station is the 250-unit TRE Residences developed by a consortium made up of Sustained Land, Great View Development and MCC Land. The 99-year leasehold TRE Residences is also scheduled for completion in 2019. Since TRE Residences was launched in November 2014, only 65 units (26%) have been sold as at end-October, according to URA data. The latest median price achieved was $1,519psf. The transaction was for a 570 sq ft, one-bedroom unit that fetched $867,000 ($1,519 psf), based on a caveat lodged with URA Realis. Sales in the project may also have slowed as homebuyers are spoilt for choice and are, therefore, adopting a wait-and-see attitude, reckons ERAs Lin. Most are waiting until the completion of TRE Residences and Sims Urban Oasis before committing to a purchase, he says. The mature Sims Vista HDB town is a five-minute walk from Sims Urban Oasis Australias James Cook University Sims Drive Campus is located at the end of Sims Drive Price uplift Located adjacent to TRE Residences and along Geylang East Avenue 1 is Central Grove, a 99- year leasehold condo by CapitaLand that was completed 15 years ago. The 262-unit project is likely to be the first private condo in the area, and it has a mix of two- and three-bedroom units. The latest transaction at Central Grove was for a three-bedroom, 1,238 sq ft unit on the third floor of one of the towers. The unit was sold in November for $1.13 million ($912 psf). The seller had purchased it in December 2007 for $775,000 ($626 psf). Prior to that, the unit had fetched $605,000 ($489 psf) when the project was first launched in December 1998. Another transaction at Central Grove was for a 1,238 sq ft unit on the 17th floor that changed hands for $1.24 million ($1,000 psf) in April 2016. It is clear that with the new private condos such as Sims Urban Oasis and TRE Residences priced in the $1,500 psf range, Central Grove and other residential properties in the Aljunied area have benefited from the price uplift in the neighbourhood, says Savills Cheong. A short drive away is also the upcoming Paya Lebar Quarter by Australian group Lendlease. The integrated project linked to the Paya Lebar MRT interchange station will include 429 residential units. The development, called Park Place Residences, is expected to be launched in 1H2017. Park Place Residences is likely to be priced at a premium to projects in the Aljunied area given that it is part of a mixed-use development and linked to an MRT interchange, says Savills Cheong.

Residents in the Aljunied area will also be able to enjoy the amenities at the upcoming Paya Lebar Quarter, which will have a new shopping mall with cineplex, food court, supermarket and an array of F&B outlets and retail shops when it is completed in 2018. Shopping malls in Paya Lebar that opened in recent years include One KM and Paya Lebar Square.

Yet, it was one of the bestselling private condominium projects in 2016. At its launch during the weekend of Oct 8 and 9, Forest Woods saw 337 units (65%) sold by balloting at an average price of $1,400 psf. As at mid-December, the tally was 380 units (73%). Located on Lorong Lew Lian, Forest Woods is a five-minute walk to the nex shopping mall, which is integrated with the Serangoon MRT interchange station and the Serangoon bus interchange. The crowd on balloting day at Forest Woods, during which 337 units were snapped up Forest Woods was CDLs top-selling project in October, with 337 out of 519 units sold over its launch weekend of Oct 8 and 9 However, it is not just in the suburbs that CDL has seen units move. There has also been buying activity at Gramercy Park on Grange Road, its 174-unit luxury condo project. Gramercy Park future capital upside When Gramercy Park obtained its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) in 2Q2016, the project was soft launched with an initial release of 40 units in May. The units, priced at an average of $2,600 psf, were quickly snapped up, mainly by Singaporeans. To date, 45 of the 50 units released have been sold. There are some foreign buyers as well, given Gramercy Parks freehold tenure and prime district 10 address. CDL has also marketed the project overseas, in Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and China (in Beijing and Shanghai). View of the Gramercy Park grounds from one of the towers. CDL has sold 45 of the 50 units launched, at an average price of $2,600 psf. The buyers recognise that $2,600 psf for a prime freehold project on Grange Road represents great value, says Samuel Eyo, managing director of Singapore Christies International Real Estate. In the past, projects launched in the area crossed $3,000 psf. So buyers of Gramercy Park today can expect to see future capital upside. Units at the project range from 1,184 sq ft for a two-bedder to 7,287 sq ft for a five-bedroom penthouse. It was designed by NBBJ of New York, the same architect behind CDLs other landmark development, the 1,111-unit The Sail @ Marina Bay. Nouvel 18 CDLs third PPS Unlike Gramercy Park, Nouvel 18, another CDL luxury condo project, had a more unconventional exit. It was divested via a Profit Participation Securities platform in October, marking CDLs third and latest PPS. The divestment involved the sale of CDLs entire stake in Summervale Properties, the entity that owns Nouvel 18, for $977.6 million. CDL sold its entire investment in Summervale Properties, the owner of Nouvel 18 for $977.6 million, through its third PPS platform Based on the saleable area of 351,000 sq ft, the deal valued the 156-unit freehold project at $2,750 psf. The sale allows CDL to avoid paying hefty extension charges under the governments Qualifying Certificate conditions, which would have kicked in last month. Nouvel 18 is a redevelopment of the former Anderson 18. The 112,098 sq ft freehold site was purchased for $477.7 million, or $1,650 psf per plot ratio, in 2007 under a 50:50 joint venture (JV) between CDL and Wing Tai. The twin 36-storey solid black towers were designed by renowned Pritzker Prize-winning French architect Jean Nouvel, who also designed Wing Tais other luxury condo, Le Nouvel Ardmore, next door. The PPS has been widely anticipated after CDL bought Wing Tais 50% stake in Nouvel 18 for $411 million in July, which valued the property at $2,342 psf. Although CDL has divested the asset, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Trentwell Management, has been appointed the asset manager and marketing agent of Nouvel 18. It will manage, lease, market and sell the units in the development. For now, asset enhancement works are underway, and units will be offered for lease in 1Q2017. CDLs first PPS, launched two years ago, was a $1.5 billion partnership with US investment bank Blackstones Tactile Opportunities Fund and CIMB Banks Labuan Offshore Branch. The PPS invests in the cash flow of the assets within CDLs Quayside Collection, namely the W Singapore Hotel, The Residences at W Singapore and the Quayside Isle retail strip. The second PPS was launched in 2015, and it was a $1.1 billion joint investment with Alpha Investment Partners in a portfolio of three of CDLs office assets, namely Central Mall (office tower), Manulife Centre, and 7 & 9 Tampines Grande. New beginning at South Beach, The Venue At South Beach, CDLs mixed-use development in a JV with Malaysias IOI Properties, the JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach officially opened on Dec 15. The 634-room luxury hotel was initially branded The South Beach. Besides the JW Marriott Hotel, South Beach also contains luxury residences above the hotel, which is yet to be launched, as well as retail outlets and a Grade-A office tower, which is fully leased. The South Beach is linked to Suntec City via an overhead pedestrian bridge, and to the Esplanade MRT station underground. Next year will see the completion of CDLs The Venue Residences and Shoppes in the second quarter. Loca ted a short distance from the Potong Pasir MRT Station, The Venue contains 266 residential units and a retail po dium with 28 strata shops for sale. The residential units range from a 495 sq ft one-bedder to a 2,142 sq ft four-bedroom penthouse and the commercial units are from 301 to 1,302 sq ft. At The Venue Residences, 70% of the 266 units have been sold, while 60% of the 28 units at The Venue Shoppes have been taken up To date, 70% of the residential units at The Venue have been taken up at an average price of $1,400 psf, while 60% of the strata commercial units have been sold, with the average price hovering at $5,400 psf. Buying demand was slow and selective this year and the cautious sentiment may extend into 2017, says CDLs spokesman. Nevertheless, projects with strong locational attributes can be expected to out perform the rest of the market.

(Source: Cathay-Keris Films Pte Ltd)SINGAPORE: Siglap, with its hip cafes, indie ice-cream joints and restaurants, hides a past with many spooky secrets - from purported pontianak sightings which inspired made-in-Singapore horror movies, to its massacre sites where civilians were machine-gunned down during the Japanese Occupation.On the returning Thats My Backyard series, On The Red Dot explores more of Singapores neighbourhoods, their people, and stories. The first episode relived some little-known nuggets of Siglaps rich history. (Link: Watch the full episode here.)Here are 10 things to know about this yuppie haunt, which is home to some 40,000 people today.1. A solar eclipse and a Sumatran prince inspired the Siglap nameYou may have walked past this nondescript grave marked in yellow (which denotes royalty) at Jalan Sempadan, but do you know that in it lies a Sumatran prince who is believed to have founded Siglap?Tok Lassam came to Singapore in the early 1800s and built this village by the sea. He later nicknamed the area Si Gelap, the Malay word for the dark one, after the sky turned dark one day in 1821 and spooked many villagers in the area.Curious about the stories, amateur history researcher Sarafian Salleh wrote to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to confirm the occurrence of a solar eclipse. (A mechanical engineer by training, he had discovered his great-grandfathers grave in Kubur Kassim cemetery nearby, and decided to delve into the history of the estate.)I looked at (NASAs) website and did some interpolation in dates and discovered there was actually a total eclipse on March 4, 1821. NASA gave me a copy of the report. And just like that, Siglap got its name! he said.Mr Sarafian also managed to track down Tok Lassams descendants through his Facebook page Bugis Temasek and his various blogs about Singapore history. He met nearly 20 of his descendants at the old Kampong Siglap Mosque recently.WATCH: Hear about old kampong life from Tok Lassam's descendents (1:35)2. Spot the grave plots dedicated to supernatural beings in this cemeteryIts hard to miss this cemetery along Siglap Road, with its distinctive bright yellow gates, overhanging trees and spacious grounds - a sharp contrast to the spanking new Flamingo Valley condominium next door and trendy cafes down the hill.The Kubur Kassim cemetery is over 90 years old, and is believed to have served as a burial ground for Muslims in Siglap. Many of its graves belonged to prominent members of the Muslim community, including Dr Hafeezudin Sirajuddin Moonshi who opened the first Muslim clinic in Singapore in 1916. He was also a former Singapore Municipal Commissioner.And if you wander in and look close enough, you may be able to spot some grave plots here dedicated to the Orang Bunian, supernatural human-like beings from Malay folklore.Today, the cemetery also houses a surau (prayer house in Malay) where religious classes are conducted, and a meeting place for a tariqa (an Arabic term for a Sufi Muslim order).3. Civilians were machine-gunned around Siglap HillOne of Siglaps darkest secrets was the wartime atrocities committed in that area, where Japanese soldiers killed and buried civilians during the Japanese Occupation.Retiree Edwin Thompson recalls witnessing dozens of male Chinese being brought by Japanese soldiers to a hill in Siglap in several lorries during the early 1940s.I saw that all their hands were tied behind their back and they were ushered to walk to the top of the hill. They (the Japanese soldiers) pushed them down and machine-gunned them, he said.Five mass war graves were later found in an area dubbed the Valley of Tears or Valley of Death in Siglap. Later, 40 more mass war graves were found in the Siglap area off Evergreen Avenue, according to the National Library Boards infopedia website.WATCH: Residents share their stories (2:45)4. Pontianak hauntings here inspired a filmIf you were living in a kampong here some 50 years ago, you might think twice about venturing out at night.Villagers then believed that they were being terrorised by the pontianak - a female vampire which, according to Malay myth, is the ghost of a woman who died during childbirth. It was thought that a whiff of frangipani heralded its presence.Their fears inspired the Singapore-made cult classic Pontianak (1957) film, which was so successful it led to two sequels. Some of the scenes were shot in Kampong Siglap.The Malay film, produced by Cathay-Keris, became so popular that it was dubbed into Cantonese for Hong Kong audiences, and into English for American television as an entry for the Asian Film Festival.5. It was the Hollywood of Singapore Siglap once possessed the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, when Cathay-Keris Studio - one of two major film studios during Singapores golden era of filmmaking - set up home at Jalan Keris in 1953, next to where Ocean Park condominium is today.The studio produced dozens of Malay-language comedies, dramas and horror films from its East Coast Road base and the area was a wonderland for celebrity-spotting and autograph-hunting, where you could witness the likes of comedian Mat Sentol performing stunts on the streets.The nearby terrace houses, streets and the sea were often used for location shooting, and the studio churned out some 125 films till 1973 when it bowed out due to competition from television.Karen Chan, executive director of the Asian Film Archive, was glad that the different legends and folklores during that period were translated into film.In that 20-year period, (the films) really captured the spirit of that community and what it was like to be living in the different kampongs then.We look at these films almost like storybooks that remind us about our past, she said.6. It is home to one of Singapores oldest barber shopsThis traditional Indian barber shop is one of the longest-surviving businesses in Siglap, having been around since 1955.New Star hairdressing salon owner Pakari Kothandapani said their clientele includes Siglap's young and old residents, and well-known personalities over the years such as the late former President S R Nathan.The shop moved from its former location to across the street in Upper East Coast Road after a long-standing eviction battle in 2008. However, it still preserves its vintage 50s look and style.But there are spaces which did not survive.A thriving private wet market built in the 1940s to cater to villagers once occupied the space where Siglap Centre is today. The market was popular for its nasi lemak, fried carrot cake and Teochew mee pok.Unfortunately, it was shuttered to make room for redevelopment in 1989.7. These are the only HDB flats in Siglap and they will be gone soonThese four distinctive HDB blocks, the only public housing in that area, are a juxtaposition to the posh, well-heeled neighbours in Siglap.They were once the tallest buildings in the area, hugging the coastline with picturesque views of the sea until the East Coast Reclamation Scheme created Marine Parade estate several years later.The flats were built in 1964 to house the affected residents of a nearby kampong that had been razed by a fire sparked off by firecrackers during the Chinese New Year celebrations in 1962. The fire had engulfed more than 50 attap houses.This cluster of five-storey two-room flats is set to be demolished in the near future.8. The shoreline used to be 1km inland from where it is todayThe beachfront restaurants and bungalows that once lined the edge of the sea along Upper East Coast Road lost their million-dollar frontage when one of Singapore's biggest land reclamation projects came along in 1966.To cater to a growing population, the massive East Coast Reclamation Scheme sought to increase land area to accommodate more houses, schools, parks and other community facilities.By 1985, more than 3,600 acres of land had been reclaimed. Its first phase spanned Bedok to Tanjong Rhu, which included Siglap in between.The shoreline was extended by about a kilometre, paving the way for East Coast Park and the Marine Parade housing estate development. The last of Siglaps fishing villages disappeared in 1986.9. Frankel estate was named after a Jewish businessman who hosted Albert Einstein hereFrankel estate was once known for its expansive coconut and nutmeg plantations in the 1800s, before it was sold to wealthy Jewish entrepreneur Abraham Frankel in 1912.Mr Frankel had become successful after riding on the success of the rubber boom, his bakery and the Frankel Brothers Furniture Store on Victoria Street. At one time, he owned more than 400 acres of land in Siglap and was also known for his philanthropy.Mary Annetta Clumeck, the great grand-daughter of Mr Frankel, recalled: I remember the beautiful estate Siglap which was right by the sea. It had over 200 acres of coconut and rubber plantations.Of course, the rubber became extremely valuable during the wars and the Frankels became even wealthier. Every Sunday, we would go to Siglap for tiffin (a British colonial term for a lunch or light meal).One of the worlds greatest minds, scientist Albert Einstein, visited Siglap on November 2, 1922, to raise funds for the creation of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.The Nobel Prize winner was given a grand tour of Siglap by the Frankel family, and was said to be fascinated by the beautiful coconut palms in Frankel Estate.10. The estate with opera rootsIf you know your Verdi from your Bizet, then wandering the maze of Opera Estate could bring a special thrill because of its road names like Aida, Carmen and Tosca.Several of the street names here drew its inspiration from Western operas while those located closer to New Upper Changi Road were named after Malay operas such as Jalan Terang Bulan and Terang Bulan Avenue.You can also have fun identifying the streets that arent named after operas. For instance, Metropole Drive is believed to be named after the New York-based Metropolitan opera house, while Swan Lake is a ballet,And if you stroll down Fidelio Street, you might pass by a house that gladly welcomes strangers.This house is not only home to Ms Terry Chia and her extended family, its also a showroom for a colourful range of Peranakan wares for sale. Ms Chia, who left her corporate IT job in 2005 to start the shop, said every piece is handmade by a special craftsman in China.Her clientele are mainly from overseas, as well as those from the Peranakan community in the estate.Catch Thats My Backyard - On The Red Dot on Fridays at 9.30pm on Mediacorp Channel 5.

Large inheritances have often resulted in pitched court battles and feuds among family members.To misquote Leo Tolstoy, each unhappy family feud is unhappy in its own way.Here are some cases from The Straits Times archive:PLAYERS: Eight daughters of the late Mr Loong Yoke Phin, who are minority shareholders of four companies, have sued their only brother and his four sons, as well as another sister.WHAT'S AT STAKE: The eight sisters want to cash out their stake either by selling their shares to the defendants at a price to be determined by independent valuers or by winding up the companies.DISPUTE: They allege that they were excluded from management of the companies and were denied dividends from the rental income of more than $5.4 million. The defendants say the firms, while family-owned, were never meant to be family-run. RULING: Pending.PLAYERS: Mr Rajabali Jumabhoy, the patriarch of the Jumahboy clan, took his eldest son Ameerali to court in 1995.WHAT'S AT STAKE: Shares in Scotts Holdings which the family controlled via Scotts Investments (Singapore)DISPUTE: Mr Rajabali blamed his son for racking up losses of $50 million in the family business and dealing in family shares without permission. The court dispute divided the Jumabhoy siblings, with Ameerali and his brother Iqbal in one camp and his other brothers, Yusuf and Mustafa, and sister Perin, in the other.RULING: The court battle ended only in May 1998, when the Appeals Court cleared Ameerali of any mismanagement of the business. The brothers decided to sell their shares in Scotts Holdings - whose crown jewel was Scotts Shopping Centre on Orchard Road. The site was originally the Jumabhoys' family home. The shares were bought by DBS Land, now part of CapitaLand.PLAYERS: Mr Alan Yeo, then chairman and chief executive of food and beverage group Yeo Hiap Seng, against a rival bloc of the family which included nephews Charles and Henry Yeo and cousin Mrs Wong Chee Hong.WHAT'S AT STAKE: Control of Yeo Hiap SengDISPUTE: Unhappiness with Mr Alan Yeo began as he made some costly business moves in the late 1980s. When he wanted to bring in property and garment company Wing Tai as an investor, a group of family members opposed the sale and managed to block it. This rival faction also tried to oust Mr Alan Yeo as a director and chairman of the company. In May 1994, Mr Alan Yeo filed a court petition to dissolve the family holding company, Yeo Hiap Seng Holdings. This would give him a fighting chance of staying on.RULING: The court ruled that the company be wound up and the rival Yeo faction agreed not to oust Mr Alan Yeo. This meant that Yeo Hiap Seng shares held by this holding company were distributed among many family members.With the family mired in factional fighting, Mr Ng Teng Fong's Orchard Parade Holdings started buying up Yeo Hiap Seng's shares on the open market. Eventually, Mr Ng gained control and Mr Alan Yeo left the boardPLAYERS: Years later, brothers Charles and Henry Yeo went to court over family properties. They are the sons of Yeo Chee Kiat, who is the grandson of Yeo Hiap Seng founder Yeo Keng Lian.WHAT'S AT STAKE: Detached house in Sian Tuan Avenue, semi-detached house in Watten Terrace, detached house in Hua Guan Avenue and a portfolio of stocks and shares.DISPUTE: Madam Ng Lay Hua had willed a house each to the sons of her elder son Charles in 2002. She later cut the two grandchildren out completely and, instead, left the two houses to her younger son Henry, whom she also appointed as the sole executor.Madam Ng, a Christian, had told family members that she was not leaving her grandson any inheritance as she was disappointed he had married a non-Christian and did not attend church regularly.RULING: The High Court found in 2016 that Madam Ng had the necessary mental capacity to make her last will. The judge also noted that Madam Ng had instructed her lawyer to change the wills; and the will was not prepared on instructions by someone who stood to benefit.PLAYERS: Mr Sebastian Ng versus his mother Madam Low Ah Cheow, two of his siblings and several nephews.WHAT'S AT STAKE: The fortune of shipping magnate and philanthropist Ng Teow Yhee, worth about $7 million.DISPUTE: The elder Mr Ng died in 2001, leaving all his assets to his favourite son, Sebastian, who is one of eight children. It was reported that two of his other sons allegedly gambled heavily and a third had looked to Mr Ng Teow Yhee for financial help. Their mother often asked the father to bail them out. While the elder Mr Ng favoured Sebastian, he continued to provide for his wife and other children.RULING: The court dismissed the claims in 2007, but this was overturned in 2009 after an appeal. The Court of Appeal decided that the words used in Mr Ng Teow Yhee's will were not clear in showing his intentions. At issue, among other things, were the words \"on trust\" which had appeared in a key clause in the will and had been capitalised and underlined. The Court of Appeal queried if this meant Mr Sebastian Ng was to hold the estate in trust for the rest of the family members.PLAYERS: Three siblings, Mr Foo Jee Seng, Madam Foo Li Li and Mr Foo Jee Boo, took their brother Mr Foo Jhee Tuang to court.WHAT'S AT STAKE: $4 million house in KembanganDISPUTE: Trio want brother, who is the trustee of the house, to sell the 10-room property. They claimed it no longer generated enough rental income to justify holding on to it. The three siblings also wanted to use their share of the sale proceeds to fund their medical and living expenses.RULING: Judge ruled in 2011 that the will clearly gave the brother the discretion to postpone the sale indefinitely and share the rental income among the siblings instead. The court of appeal overturned this in 2012 after the court noted that none of the siblings had lived in the house and the proceeds from the rental were \"paltry\". That went against the overall intention of the will, which was to provide for all the beneficiaries.PLAYERS: Mother Madam Ang Ah Sew and her daughter Neo Hui LingWHAT'S AT STAKE: Three-storey house in Jalan ChengamDISPUTE: Retiree hoped to get half of the proceeds from the sale of a house she co-owned with her daughter. Ms Neo paid $1.88 million for the three-storey house, and named her mother as co-owner so it would go to her mother in the event she died first.Ms Neo invited her mother and sisters, who were living in a flat in Bishan, to move in with her - on the condition that they live in harmony.But they began squabbling. Ms Neo moved out after her mother and sisters barged into her bedroom one night with six strangers to perform \"religious rites to cleanse\" the room. When she moved to sell the house, her mother - using her position as co-owner - blocked the sale.RULING: Judge ruled in 2011 that the mother had no claim to any of the proceeds - the sum of nearly $1 million was to be handed over to her daughter.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

This makes the city-state amongst the most demanding together with Mexico.More so, American Express Singapore Country Manager Cheng Heng Chew said the study revealed that the breaking point for two-thirds of Singaporeans is two or more bad experiences before they take their businesses elsewhere and one-third will switch companies immediately.\"Companies that give customers poor experience have lost sales. However, businesses that get it right in terms of service will be rewarded and customers tell us theyll spend an average of 16% more when they receive excellent service, Cheng noted.In addition, good customer service plays a significant part in consumers buying decisions. Six out of 10 customers rank service as the second most important factor when considering to do business with a company. Their top concern is still value for money at 72%.Around 73% of consumers said businesses have at least met their expectations and 4% said their expectations were exceeded. This presents an opportunity for businesses to step up as excellent customer service lead to a significant increase in consumer desire to spend more.Interestingly, Singapore ranks third out of the nine countries surveyed where customers are willing to spend more with companies that provide excellent service, behind India and the U.S. 72% are willing to spend an average of 16% more because of excellent customer service.Here's more from the study:Focus on speed, empathy and education41% of consumers would like their needs to be taken care of more quickly in the next five years. The next two priorities are to train representatives to make a personalised connection (20%) and make them aware of helpful benefits and services (20%).

Strict cost management and the sheer will to outlast all its competitors.It is also getting help from a National University of Singapore computer science student, Ms Janel Herseri, who has a proposal to return the business to profitability - a redesign of Poh Kim's website and to manage online interactions with customers on its social media channels.Founder Lim Chee Yong, 58, is also counting on the sale of DVD film titles using the new 4K technology - ultra high-definition resolution - to boost sales.One of the first retailers here to stop selling film cameras when the digital camera revolution hit in the early 2000s, Alan Photo is once again remodelling itself to survive the advent of the smartphone camera.Founder Alan Tan's children, who have since taken over the running of the business, have come up with an innovative idea of an \"experience store\" that allows potential customers to try and compare across all brands of cameras in the shop.Dubbed REC by Alan Photo in CT Hub 2, an industrial building in Lavender Street, the 3,000 sq ft store is equipped with a studio, accompanying lights and photography consultants.Bookbinding company Grandluxe's rich 75-year history mattered little when accounting software and mobile phone calendar apps rendered books and diaries obsolete.To come up with new ways to engage customers, third-generation owner Winnie Chan launched retail company Bynd Artisan in 2014, which aims to give customers an experience by selling custom-made notebooks and personalised leather products.Bynd Artisan now has three outlets and there are plans to open a fourth one this year.When Mr Morgan Yeo took over his father's furniture business in February 2014, JR&P Industries, due to the latter's failing health, he realised its business model was too antiquated for the 21st century.A rebranding into a new firm - Roger&Sons - soon followed, which paid homage to his late father and offers customised carpentry work.Instead of producing mass market office furniture, Mr Yeo and his brothers agreed that including design elements to elevate the artistry of the trade was the way forward.A new website, branding and social media sites were also rolled out to leverage on the heritage and craftsmanship of the firm's carpentry.Despite doing a booming business supplying pots and pans to restaurants and hotels, kitchenware company Sia Huat went out on a limb to launch its retail arm in 2010 as it sought to leverage on the lack of speciality stores here.Tools of The Trade (ToTT), which touts a lifestyle concept around cooking and baking, now contributes over 15 per cent of Sia Huat's business.Its flagship store in Dunearn Road sells a mix of kitchenware, tableware and bakeware from over 100 brands, and also organises cooking classes, birthday parties and corporate team-building events.Giving up his high-flying management consultant job to join his family's traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) manufacturing business in 2010, Mr Dylan Hu was determined to banish the stereotypes the younger generation held of TCM.So helped market one of the business' existing brands, TruLife, in 2011 to offer a range of detox products aimed at time-strapped young adults.With young consumers in mind, Mr Hu worked on improving the taste profile and aesthetics of TruLife's products, ditching the traditional, old-school look of TCM packaging for sleek bottles, packaged in convenient, ready-to-go sizes.Today, TruLife is stocked at pharmacies such as Guardian and Watsons and, after only four years, contributes to more than a third of Poli Medical's overall revenue.Started in 1965 as a small nursery business, Far East Flora dreamt big as part of its drive to become a leading florist and gift company in South-east Asia.It launched an e-commerce website in 2000, taking advantage of the dot-com boom to grow its business and widen its regional reach.Far East Flora now delivers to more than 140 countries, offering more than 1,000 choices in flowers, gifts plants and hampers.It also expanded its foothold into Malaysia in 2010 by launching a Malaysian site and Floristika, a one-stop floriculture centre in Kuala Lumpur.Over the last 20 years, Astralink first found itself the victim of economic malaise before succumbing to the crosswinds of technological shifts.Its first two products - an award-winning cordless phone called the ClipFone and a fixed-line multimedia terminal for a Hong Kong telco that was described as the smartphone's predecessor - were hit hard by the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the global charms of Apple's iPhone.Now, the engineering firm is bouncing back with a foray into the Internet of Things space with a technology to help users keep track of groceries, as well as venturing overseas by signing a $5 million-a-year contract with a telco in Africa to supply some 5,000 homes with energy-monitoring systems.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Ong, who is married to a Vietnamese citizen and a father of four, says, Its a slower pace of life. The same cannot be said of Vietnams property market, though. It has been sizzling since the government relaxed its foreign ownership rules in July 2015. There has been a lot of interest from overseas investors, especially those from Singapore, notes Ong. The appetite for Vietnamese projects was evident at CapitaLands and Keppel Lands weekend launches of their Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) projects in Singapore in late-2015. Keppel Land sold more than 50 units in the second phase of the 719-unit The Estella over one weekend in late October. The following weekend, CapitaLand sold over 100 units in Singapore when it showcased two projects, the 1,152-unit Vista Verde and the 750-unit The Vista. Meanwhile, Singaporean serial entrepreneur and property investor Adam Khoo of the eponymous Adam Khoo Learning Centre reportedly scooped up 100 apartments at Diamond Lotus Lake View project in Tan Phu District, HCMC in December 2015. The 100 apartments Khoo purchased are equivalent to 10 floors in the project of more than 700 units, developed by Vietnamese developer Phuc Khang Corp. Prices at Diamond Lotus Lake View are said to start from VND678 million ($41,656 ) a unit. For that price, one cannot buy even an HDB flat in Singapore, nor the Certificate of Entitlement on a new car only a four-year-old Ducati or a used Honda Civic. Source: Bloomberg With a young and entrepreneurial population driving consumer spending and GDP growth, Vietnam has one of the most vibrant economies in the region Very attractive yields And it is such price comparisons that are luring Singaporeans to invest in Vietnam. For $1 million, you can buy five to six high-end condos in Ho Chi Minh City, or up to 10 units in a mid-tier condo, says Ong. He and his wife have amassed a portfolio of more than five properties in Vietnam, primarily in Hanoi and HCMC. We buy condos in the city centre, or within 2km to 3km of the CBD, he adds. Prices have also escalated over the past three years. Ong bought a high-end condo for US$1,600 psm in HCMC in 2013. A month ago, a new high-end condo development located across the road was launched at US$2,500 psm. If I were to sell my unit today, I think I can easily fetch US$2,000 psm, says Ong. Currently, gross yields are at about 6% to 7%, which is considered very attractive for investors from Singapore and Taiwan, as yield is low in their home markets, observes Neil MacGregor, managing director of Savills Vietnam. Hence, these investors tend to focus on smaller units priced between US$150,000 and US$250,000, which can be easily leased out, and achieve higher yields, he says. Investments by Singaporean investors may not be as much as that by the mainland Chinese, but they are the leading investors in real estate in Vietnam to date, notes Marc Townsend of CBRE. Set to reap demographic dividend One of Vietnams biggest assets is its population of 95.2 million, of which more than half are aged between 15 and 39. They form the majority of the workforce. With a young and entrepreneurial population driving consumer spending and GDP growth, Vietnam has one of the most vibrant economies in the region, says Savills MacGregor, who has lived there since 2000. Vietnam is set to reap the benefits of this demographic dividend for the next 10 to 15 years, MacGregor notes. The rapidly growing middle class and the young population have also fuelled strong demand for affordable housing, with the sweet spot in the price range of US$40,000 to US$120,000, he adds. Recognising the demand, major real estate companies, especially local firms, have shifted their focus to low- to mid-tier residential developments. With a booming economy, Vietnam is attracting foreign investors who see untapped opportunities in a range of different sectors, says MacGregor. Boom in hospitality The hospitality sector is also entering a boom period, with strong demand for both city-centre hotels as well as resorts, says MacGregor. According to the General Statistics Office, Vietnam recorded 10.1 million international visitor arrivals in 2016, up 26% from a year ago. In 1Q2017, international visitors reached 3.2 million, a 29% increase over the same period last year, according to financial and investment advisory services firm AsiaInvest Group. The increase was said to be driven by visitors from other Asian countries, notably mainland Chinese, who accounted for almost 30% of the total number of arrivals. This was followed by visitors from South Korea, Japan, the US and Russia. Danang has seen particularly strong growth in recent years as tourism has boomed, supported by rapid growth in the number of direct flights from other cities across Asia, says MacGregor. With Danang hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) Summit this year, the profile of the city is likely to be raised. Nha Trang/Cam Ranh and Phu Quoc are the next destinations that will benefit from tourism growth, with the number of direct flights set to increase rapidly over the next three to five years, says MacGregor. In Haiphong, northern Vietnams busiest port, the economy is being driven by growth in manufacturing and logistics. MacGregor: Vietnam is set to reap the benefits of this demographic dividend for the next 10 to 15 years Manufacturing-led economy The manufacturing sector is fuelling household income and promises a sustained trade surplus in Vietnam, according to AsiaInvest. While GDP growth in 1Q2017 was estimated at 5.1%, according to the General Statistics Office, FocusEconomics panellists have forecast economic growth of 6.4% for Vietnam for the whole of 2017, and the same level of growth in 2018. The Nikkei manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index hit a 22-month high of 54.6 points in March. This resulted in 1Q2017 PMI data being the strongest quarter that we have seen since the survey began in early 2011, says IHS Markit economist Andrew Harker. This was coupled with a near-record increase in employment stemming from companies optimism that workload will continue to expand in the near term, he adds. It is even more remarkable considering that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, of which Vietnam was supposed to be a major beneficiary, has since been put on ice after the US pulled out. Instead, Vietnams economy has been bolstered by its other regional alliances, including the Asean Economic Community; Free Trade Agreements with the EU, Russia, South Korea, Chile; and the upcoming Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. In 1Q2017, Vietnam registered foreign direct investment of US$7.7 billion, up 77.6% y-o-y. About 85% of the FDI went to the manufacturing sector, and 4.4%, to real estate. The 4.4% FDI in real estate totalled US$343.7 million, representing a 34.4% increase from a year ago, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment. The property sector, therefore, ranked second in terms of FDI inflows between January and March this year. The biggest FDI contributor to Vietnam in 1Q2017 was South Korea (US$3.75 billion), with Singapore in second place (US$911 million), followed by China (US$824 million), Taiwan (US$644 million) and Japan (US$452 million). Growth in retail Another sector that is booming is retail. During the first two months of 2017, Vietnams retail sales and service turnover grew 8.7% compared with the same period last year, says JLL in its Vietnam property market report on March 28. While supply of prime shopping centres in HCMC remained flat in 1Q2017, convenience stores operated by domestic and foreign retailers continued to expand citywide, JLL adds. Supply reached 199,350 sq m in total, and the overall occupancy rate rose to 92.2%. Likewise, in the capital city of Hanoi, total supply of prime shopping centres and retail space remained unchanged as no new projects were completed in 1Q2017. However, convenience stores saw rapid growth in the city, with supply reaching 47,500 sq m in total. A large volume of quality supply in retail space is projected to be completed over the next two years, says JLL. The retail market in Hanoi and HCMC is likely to see more local and foreign retailers expanding their footprint in good locations, according to the property consultancy. Record office occupancy There is also strong demand for quality office buildings in HCMC. The occupancy rate of Grade-A office space hit a record 95.6% in 1Q2017, while that for Grade-B office space stood at 91.8%, according to JLL. Total stock of Grade-A office space in HCMC was 192,179 sq m just 23% of Grade-B stock (831,948 sq m) and 24.5% of Grade-C stock (785,037 sq m). In 1Q2017, average net rents in the Grade-A and Grade-B space in HCMC rose 0.4% q-o-q to US$38.7 and US$22 psm per month respectively, says JLL. Net absorption in Grade-A and Grade-B projects totalled 490 sq m and 41,087 sq m, respectively, with demand driven primarily by the financial services and IT sectors. Average rents of office space in non-CBD office projects rose at a faster clip up 0.9% q-o-q in 1Q2017 with demand driven by newcomers in District 7, District 10 and Tan Binh District, says JLL. Office rents in HCMC are expected to continue their upward trend as supply will remain unchanged until 2H2017, notes JLL. The new office developments Deutsches Haus and Saigon Centre Phase II are scheduled to be completed in 3Q2017. Office supply is expected to soar only in 2019, as high-quality projects are expected to come on stream then, and mostly in the suburban areas, JLL says. In Hanoi, more than 130,000 sq m of Grade-B office space from five projects is expected to come on stream this year. However, there is no new supply of Grade-A office space this year. Two huge Grade-A office projects scheduled for completion in 2018/19 will add a total of 240,000 sq m of space to the market, says JLL. Demand for new and modern office space with a reasonable rent is expected to increase over the next quarters. Infrastructure boom Both Hanoi and HCMC have ambitious transport infrastructure programmes, according to Savills Vietnam Research. HCMC is expected to invest more than US$20 billion in infrastructure, including five planned elevated roads stretching 71km and five new metro lines of 106km. Similarly, Hanoi has eight metro lines of 260km and six elevated roads in the pipeline. The first metro line, scheduled to be fully operational by 2020, is expected to shift development focus. Living further from the city will become more appealing and cost-effective and shift the focus of investors away from the centre, says Savills in its report on urban transport. Properties near transit hubs can have significant capital appreciation: 10% in China and Thailand, and 32% in Hong Kong. The same pattern will arise in Vietnam. Building infrastructure has become critical as more people are buying cars in Vietnam, owing to decreased import duties within Asean and increased incomes. In the past five years, car sales grew 35% per annum and are expected to triple by 2025, according to Savills. Massive urbanisation is also taking place. Construction is happening everywhere not just in HCMC, but Hanoi, Danang and across many other cities in Vietnam, according to CBRE. Acquiring land is a challenge As there is a limited amount of government land for public auction, the big local Vietnamese developers are turning to farmers to purchase big land parcels, notes CBREs Townsend. They are developing large townships that are likely to benefit from future infrastructure development, he adds. As the rules concerning buying government land are opaque, the biggest challenge for foreign developers is finding a greenfield site that is free and has a clean ownership title, says Savills MacGregor. Some developers may face issues such as having to buy a site from multiple shareholders. Others may have to deal with clearance and compensation of existing households on the site, which can be time-consuming, he notes. The Vietnam Association of Realtors recorded 18,340 transactions of land plots, residential and resort properties in 1Q2017, according to the breaking news on Vietnam on April 21. The figure is said to reflect both a q-o-q and y-o-y decline. The difficulty in securing land sites could have also led to a fall in the number of new apartments launched. In 1Q2017, 5,200 new apartments were available for sale in HCMC, a 47% contraction q-o-q. At the same time, total volume of transactions in 1Q2017 was 8,800 units, down 13% q-o-q. Savills forecasts that supply from 2Q2017 to 2019 will reach 62,200 in HCMC, with Districts 2 and 7 contributing the most 21% each. Source: VN REA NREA is also the bridge between enterprises and government authorities, and between Vietnam enterprises and the international business community, says Nguyen. VNREA members have played an important role in Vietnams booming property market, he adds. Foreign ownership concerns The biggest concern among individual foreign buyers of apartments is the withdrawal of their funds when they sell their property in the future, and also whether the 50-year lease is renewable, says MacGregor. Another major concern that surfaced recently is the issue of ownership certificates (or pink book) to foreigners.Tuoi Tre NewsandThe Straits Timesreported last month that the municipal land registration office in HCMC has stopped issuing ownership certificates to foreigners. Currently, foreign purchasers of CapitaLands projects, including Mulberry Lane in Hanoi, have received ownership certificates, says the developer. Thus, it is a matter of waiting for clear procedural guidelines from the upper level authorities, says CapitaLand in an email response to queries. The issue has not dented demand in Vietnams housing market, though. Nguyen Tran Nam, chairman of the Vietnam National Real Estate Association (VNREA) and former deputy minister of construction, expects more new launches in 2Q2017 and foresees higher sales volume than in the first quarter. VNREA is a non-profit organisation with 4,500 members across the country, many of whom are involved in the real estate sector from developers and property consultants to investors and analysts. As an official representative of the real estate community, VNREA is also the bridge between enterprises and government authorities, and between Vietnam enterprises and the international business community, says Nguyen. VNREA members have played an important role in Vietnams booming property market, he adds. Meanwhile, Vietnam is seeing more millionaires who have made their money from trading property, says Savills MacGregor. It has happened all over the world. But the fact that Vietnam is still at a very early stage of development, it is possible to make a lot of money in a short space of time during the boom times."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

But they can set up companies based in the Baltic nation.This scheme helps Estonia generate business for its companies, from independent contractors to small companies with clients worldwide.Denmark, with 5.7 million people, is mulling the creation of a \"Silicon Valley Ambassador\" to better engage digital companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook.\"This is almost as if technology was its own country, unlike the present,\" said Mr Ho.\"For Singapore, such an approach would build on our earlier efforts to partner other cities and sub-national regions to plug them into international production networks,\" he added.The third country is Luxembourg, with fewer than 600,000 people.It is, however, creating a market by letting companies own resources obtained from space.These are ideas Singapore can consider, Mr Ho told officials and students at the National University of Singapore.The country does not have to be at the mercy of forces which it thinks are beyond its control. \"Because we are a small country, we often speak as if the future were a car speeding toward us - we can swerve, or we can run backward. We can scarcely control the car.\"But \"even small city-states can influence, shape, and even create, not just markets, but also their operating environment,\" he added.Mr Ho gave two reasons for his optimism.First, Singapore can experiment with policies and roll them out more easily because it is small.It can also correct its course quickly if a policy was wrong or misguided.Second, Singapore has experience in responding to complexity and uncertainty and can draw on it.As a newly-independent nation, it eschewed import substitution, courted multinational corporations and chose multicultural meritocracy when its neighbours were going for the opposite.But Singapore has to have the courage to seize this hope and reinvent itself, added Mr Ho, who is now a senior adviser at a think-tank, the Centre for Strategic Futures.\"Just as Sir Stamford Raffles made Singapore a free port in 1819, welcoming traders from any country, Singapore in 2017 could welcome data from any country - a free data port,\" he said.It could allow data centres in Singapore to hold data governed by the laws of another country, as if they were stored in the source country.This would anchor the data here, allowing local-based companies to harness insights from data, he added.It makes sense in a world where data and digital technology frequently and easily cross international borders.Estonia's e-residency \"hints at how nations could redefine their identities, and what it means to be a nation, in a digital era,\" said Mr Ho.Such reinvention can ensure a country's way of life survives beyond its physical borders, he added.Quoting an Estonian official, he said: \"Land is so yesterday. It doesn't matter where you physically live or operate. That is how the game will change.''But becoming a \"virtual nation\" carries risks.To withstand cyber-attacks, Estonia is experimenting with \"digital embassies'', where data is stored on servers in its embassies abroad.It is also developing ways to migrate data to commercial servers, such as those hosted by Microsoft, as back-up in the event that cyber-attacks take place.Re-invention in the digital age is a matter of long-term survival for global hubs like Singapore, said Mr Ho.This is because changes in technology, trade routes and geopolitics can gradually diminish a country's position as a global hub.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

His secret? Working in the sales and trading division at a foreign investment bank.And his is apparently a fairly typical case, at least among those who land internships in investment banking or sales and trading at foreign banks such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citi, and Deutsche Bank. These trainees are paid between S$8,000 and S$10,000 a month, The Business Times understands.When contacted, the banks either did not respond or declined to comment.According to human resource (HR) consulting firm Adecco, most interns here typically get a monthly stipend of between S$600 and S$1,000 for their vacation work stints. Among full-time employees, the average gross monthly income last year was S$3,500, excluding employer CPF. In addition, only 106,200 out of 2.1 million full-time employees - just over 5 per cent - were in the S$8,000- S$9,999 pay bracket (excluding employer CPF), figures from the Ministry of Manpower show. As for full-timers between the ages of 15 and 24 - the typical age of most interns - only 100 out of 130,200 earned between S$7,000 and S$7,999. The number drawing at least S$8,000 a month is too insignificant to be recorded. But, as would be expected, these top-paying internships don't come easy - in terms of both securing one as well as the demands of the job.\"I would be in the office at 6.30am and leave at 9pm,\" said Alex, explaining that he had willingly stayed back to read up on market news and prepare reports for the team for the next day.He revealed that on the day of the \"Brexit\" vote results last June, most interns were in at 4am. \"Expectations are pretty high; you work really hard if you want the full-time job. This can range from doing the most menial tasks like buying coffee three times a day, to automating spreadsheets for the team to make things go faster.\"Linda Teo, country manager of HR firm ManpowerGroup, said the banks see high compensation as part of employer branding and talent-attraction strategies.\"They are willing to offer top dollar to attract the creme de la creme of interns with the hope that especially outstanding interns will take up full-time roles with these companies after they graduate,\" added Ms Teo.A past intern that BT spoke to managed to achieve conversion to a full-time role during his internship in a sales role at a foreign investment bank.\"I was given a big research project which had a direct impact on the actual business my team was involved in,\" he said. \"At the end of five weeks, I needed to present to the whole team on my thought process and how this project could translate into actual P&L (profit and loss).\"After his first five weeks, the market analyst, now in a global role, was moved to a different team during a rotational stint - to an area where he had zero experience in.\"Essentially, I was thrown into the deep end of the pool. The tempo was just as fast and my new manager had high expectations for me nonetheless, despite me being new to the asset class. To impress my second boss, I had to do a lot of self-reading and work longer hours to make up for deficiency in experience.\"Erman Tan, president of the Singapore Human Resources Institute (SHRI), said that interns who are offered a high salary despite not having had full-time experience are typically smarter, are excellent orators and leaders, and who can simplify complex problems. It is no wonder that even the application process for these internships can be as arduous as they come.Applicants are first filtered by their resumes and essays, as well as psychometric and personality tests.Some candidates are required to go through a phone interview with a mid-level executive, before meeting face-to-face with senior management.Those who manage to battle through to the next round often undergo a full or half day's worth of back-to-back interviews and assessments, which can be in a group or individual setting. For some, a zero-sum game trading exercise might even be thrown into the mix.A past intern at a major US bank said that summer interns form the dominant pipeline of full-time hires.\"Interns are empowered to take on tasks of full-time analysts. This can range from executing client mandates to financial analyses and modelling,\" added the ex-intern, who worked in the investment banking division.According to global recruitment firm Hays, full-time investment banking analysts here drew annual salaries of S$70,000 to S$90,000 in 2016, while associates earned S$90,000 to S$130,000.Meanwhile, junior global market traders took home S$55,000 to S$70,000 in 2016, while traders earned S$80,000 to S$180,000. The numbers do not include bonuses.These top-paying finance internships aside, employers here are increasingly willing to invest in interns with multidisciplinary skills, or who show potential to perform.\"In addition to the usual stable of high-paying employers such as investment banks and tech behemoths like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, we are seeing an increasing number of employers who place a premium on cross-discipline skill sets,\" said Looi Qin En, chief operating officer of local talent recruitment startup Glints. He cites software firm Silverlake Axis which is offering S$1,000 a month to polytechnic and university interns with the relevant skill sets for fintech development. The firm has also offered an all-expenses-paid overseas learning trip to woo these interns.Meanwhile, DBS Bank and OCBC Bank have come out with specialised internship programmes that focus on using multidisciplinary skills to address specific business problems.Now in its second year, the DBS UNI.CORN programme saw a five-fold increase in applications to over 1,000 this year. UNI.CORN interns, who hail from diverse disciplines, are paid more than the typical undergraduate interns, who get between S$1,100 and S$1,500.OCBC launched its FRANKpreneurship programme in March, featuring one and a half years' of effort and partnerships with Adobe and Google. Interns are attached to different departments and tasked to find creative solutions to a problem that may not be confined to any existing banking issue."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

While in University, she was also awarded the Carson Scholarship to study public policy in Washington D.C.Wongs personal real estate investments prompted her to join Savills as a salesperson in which she was quickly the best newcomer and was promoted to sales director within a year. She started consulting for developers in 2013 and subsequently founded Anthill Realtors, a real estate agency at the age of 29 in 2014. Headquartered in Singapore, Anthill Realtors' forte in sourcing investment grade properties from within and abroad with a one-of-a-kind concierge service is guided by the one belief that if you take care of your clients, your business will take care of itself.In March 2017, Rhonda was recognised as a Women Icon at the Inaugural Women Icons Summit & Awards. She received the award for her entrepreneurial spirit and efforts to add value to the local HDB market.We spoke with Wong to find out more about his thoughts on speaking at the upcoming Singapore Business Review's 20 Hottest Startups Panel Briefing 2017, happening on July 11, 2017, 8:30-11:30AM at the Meeting Room 3345, Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre.What are your previous experiences and positions held that contributed to who you are as an entrepreneur today?After graduating from the business school at the University of Michigan, I started my first job as a treasury bonds options trader at Nico Trading in Chicago, where I was the only female trader in the company. After a few years, I decided to go back to Singapore to be with my parents and started a bunch of businesses. Being serial entrepreneur at heart, I worked on several businesses including retail in Singapore; import and export of equipment from USA and acted as a consultant on other businesses such as childrens education in Suzhou, China, saved up some money and eventually begun investing in real estate. That started my journey into the real estate sector.Living in Singapore we are generally very blessed but we do face first world problems. 82% of our resident population living in HDB traditionally have a lack of options in transacting their own homes. But in reality they are fully capable of helping themselves if someone were to just make the process simpler. So we started Ohmyhome, simplifying the process of selling, buying, renting your HDB, so that today, everyone can manage this process themselves completely free of charge. And if they were to need an agent to assist, our flat fees are more manageable at $2,888. We have an exceptional team of highly experienced agents, and weve been getting wonderful reviews from our customers, which reaffirms that were on the right track.What are your key business philosophies?I believe that businesses are very powerful. They have the ability to change the world, change the way people behave and even change the way we think about ourselves and one another. Therefore, I believe that businesses should be meaningful and be built with integrity. So that as the business prosper, at the same time we would be building a responsible world, a better world.Can you give us a glimpse of what you will talk about at the Hottest Startups Panel Briefing 2017?I will be taking part in the Creating a brand story panel. A companys brand story is like your own personality. It has to be genuine, something that you truly feel during the creation of your business and your operations should set in place plans to execute and deliver that story. When you try to be a story that someone said you should be, unless you have a flawless marketing team, youll find it difficult to upkeep that image because the real story will show in your business making decisions, in your customer service, and your consumers will feel it.The SBR 20 Hottest Startups Panel Briefing will be on July 11 at the Meeting Room 3345, Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre.If you are interested to attend, you may contact Nikki Quiniquini at [emailprotected] or at +65 3158 1386 ext 238."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It takes a lot of effort to move,\" says Prive Group chairman Yuan Oeij. \"But now that this has happened, we just want to make sure we are treated fairly.\"Meanwhile, eatery Jiak Kopi Cafe, which also spent more than S$100,000 on renovations in recent months began operations on the ground floor at the end of February.Cafe owner Mr Kho Long Huat said he would not have renovated had he known about the redevelopment plans when he signed the lease agreement last December.\"We're just a small business,\" said Mr Kho, who is also the managing director of a construction company. \"It's unfortunate that our investment is now going down the drain.\"Prive Group is seeking an arrangement with the building owners that is \"fair\" for both parties, while the eatery's attempts at seeking compensation has been rejected.The management office declined multiple requests for comment.Not all tenants, however, were troubled by the redevelopment notice.The lease agreement includes a clause that states that the landlord has to provide at least four months' notice to terminate the tenancy in the event of any redevelopment plans.Recruiting company iKas Group, which has been leasing out an office at the building for six years, said it already had plans to move out.\"We've been here for a while and it would be nice to move to a new place,\" said manager Adam Davies.Hub Synergy Point came under single ownership in 2015, after a company majority owned by Mr Ho Kian Cheong of Keng Seng Group bought the top three floors for a total of nearly S$30 million.The company bought the 26th storey for S$9.97 million, or S$2,400 psf, and the 27th and 28th storeys for S$20 million or S$1,512 psf, according to a Business Times report.Under a single ownership, the building's owner could redevelop the building to maximise its potential value. It is about 250-m from Tanjong Pagar MRT station.Analysts say motivations behind the redevelopment could be to maximise the land's plot ratio.Hub Synergy Point is 28 storeys but the maximum height allowed there is 35 storeys, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority.Director of real estate agency Chris International, Mr Chris Koh, said another reason could be to rejuvenate the building, which was built in 1973, to attract future tenants.And with the office rental market expected to be flat this year, it is timely to carry out redevelopment plans now, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

In 2015, there were efforts to get it gazetted as a conserved building, but the attempt failed as the liaison committee did not get 100 per cent agreement for conservation from owners.For the development to go on the market, the en-bloc committee now has to work with Colliers and Lee and Lee to get 80 per cent of homeowners to agree to the collective sale.They have up to one year to do so, although they hope to collect the required signatures within this quarter and to launch the tender by the fourth quarter of 2017, said Mr Alex Poh, chairman of the 12-member en-bloc committee.\"It's all about timing,\" Mr Poh added. \"The earlier the better, and it fits the market trend right now.\"Analysts have said the residential collective sales market is poised to pick up, as private home sales have stabilised and there is strong demand for land by developers.In May, former HUDC estate Rio Casa was sold for S$575 million in an en-bloc deal and last month, another HUDC estate Serangoon Ville was put up for collective sale.Mr Poh said he initiated the en-bloc process because the Pearl Bank Apartments building isgetting harder and more expensive to maintain due to its age. He approached a few residents last December to form the committee with him.\"It is also the next-best option to getting Pearl Bank conserved, since the last time it required all residents to agree to conserve the building, and we weren't able to do that,\" Mr Poh added.\"But in this case, the developer might choose to conserve it if the authorities approve.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

By contrast, he noted that Hong Kong apartment prices have been soaring, adding that \"sensible investors will come here,\" instead.GuocoLand Singapore Group managing director Cheng Hsing Yao said buying by foreigners has picked up since the start of the year at the developer's high-end Leedon Residence project, near the 150-year-old Singapore Botanic Gardens.GuocoLand is part of Malaysian conglomerate Hong Leong Group, headed by billionaire Quek Leng Chan. \"In absolute numbers, it may not be that huge, but the ticket sizes are actually quite significant for some of them,\" Mr Cheng said. Some foreigners were buying homes worth S$8-12 million in the project, he said.The recent tightening of property market controls elsewhere, such as in Hong Kong and Australia, has played a part in attracting foreign demand to Singapore's luxury property this year, Mr Cheng said.City Developments Ltd (CDL), one of the largest Singapore developers, also said the average sales price at its high-end Gramercy Park project has risen to more than S$2,800 per square feet in recent months, up 8 per cent from a year ago, and foreign buyers accounted for three-quarters of the project so far.CDL's billionaire chairman Kwek Leng Beng is a cousin of the Malaysian developer Quek.PLENTY OF TOOLSStill, Singapore's broader residential market remains subdued, having fallen for 15 straight quarters to log its longest losing streak since official records began in 1975.\"We are forecasting for prices to come down between 1 to 5 per cent this year before reaching an inflection point in 2018,\" said Eli Lee, an analyst for OCBC Investment Research.While prices in Hong Kong tripled and Sydney's doubled over the past decade, Singapore prices rose just 29 per cent.Singapore introduced property price cooling measures to curb speculation as did many other \"hot property\" cities in the region. While some measures were relaxed slightly this year, the authorities warned last month there would be no more rolling back for now.Singapore is not short of policy tools to ward off speculators.Most of the island's apartment blocks were built and then managed by the government, though the vast majority of the units have been sold to citizens. This allows it to keep control of some speculative activity, and therefore prices. Initial buyers of government apartments, for example, are largely prevented from flipping a property through a fast resale.The high home ownership rate, at about 90 per cent, also makes it easier for policymakers to craft measures targeting speculative demand when the market is overheated.All home buyers have to pay a stamp duty at a progressive rate of up to 3 per cent, but foreigners have to pay an additional 15 per cent for their purchases. Singaporeans also have to pay an extra stamp duty of 7-10 per cent when they make second and subsequent purchases.\"With tightening measures taken in other countries, that could lead investors to shift funds back here. So we just have to watch that very closely,\" Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said last month.New home sales more than doubled in March from a year earlier, reaching their highest level in nearly four years.And developers, led by Chinese companies, are paying record sums to secure land. Shenzhen-based developer Logan Property and its partner Nanshan Group recently paid a record S$1 billion at a government land auction. That was almost 50 per cent more than the previous record set in 1997.\"The strong winning bid...signals developers' strong confidence in the Singapore residential market and their belief that prices could return to growth soon,\" said Christine Li, research director at Cushman and Wakefield in Singapore.REUTERS"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

CapitaLand, CCT and Mitsubishi Estate on Thursday said that they were redeveloping Golden Shoe Carpark into a mixed-use project for about S$1.82 billion before acquisition costs.The market has been waiting for the announcement since the trust first announced its intention last October, pending the authorities' approval. The redevelopment follows in the footsteps of the nearby CapitaGreen which was redeveloped from the former Market Street Carpark in 2014. In many ways, the deal was structured similarly to CapitaGreen. The three parties involved are the same. For Golden Shoe, they will set up two single-purpose sub-trusts - Glory Office Trust for the commercial portions of the development, and Glory SR Trust for the serviced residence portion. CapitaLand and CCT will each hold 45 per cent in each of the trusts, while Mitsubishi will hold the remaining 10 per cent. The joint venture will acquire the car park from CCT for S$161.1 million - 10 per cent above the average of two valuations.CCT will hold a five-year call option (versus three years for CapitaGreen) from occupation to acquire its partners' stakes in the commercial component of the development at market valuation. This will be subject to a minimum price based on the total development cost less net property income, compounded at 6.3 per cent per annum.Additionally, CapitaLand and CCT will also have a drag-along right over Mitsubishi's stake in the serviced residence component.THIS is over five years at an agreed value, subject to a minimum price calculated the same way but compounded at 5 per cent per annum.The structuring of the development into two sub-trusts is deliberate to allow the flexibility of divesting the serviced residence portion easily.Ms Leong said: \"At the moment, we want to see through the stabilisation of the serviced residence, and it is actually a good part of an integrated development, just like for Raffles City where the two hotels (Fairmont and Swissotel The Stamford) are also part of the integrated development.\"But of course, we always structure this with a flexibility in mind . . . so that in the future, if there is a need to delink it from the office, we can exit very easily. And also because it is a trust structure, it will be appealing to potential Reits that require tax transparency, and because it is managed by the reputable Ascott, it should be attractive to other kinds of hotel owners.\"The total development cost is S$1.82 billion, of which more than half, or S$957.8 million, went towards land-related costs and the differential premium to change the land use from \"transport facilities\" to \"commercial\".The redevelopment is expected to generate a yield-on-cost of about 5 per cent each year when the project is completed and stabilised, assuming office rentals of S$12-14 per square foot and a revenue per available room of S$255-270 for the serviced residence.CCT is funding its share of the redevelopment through divestment proceeds and debt. It recently sold One George Street for S$1.18 billion into a partnership which it will own 50 per cent of, and is in the midst of selling Wilkie Edge to Lian Beng for S$280 million.There are some analysts that would have preferred for CCT to take a bigger stake in the consortium, given that the development limit for Reits has been raised from 10 per cent previously to 25 per cent of their deposited property now. To this, Ms Leong said that she preferred not to take undue excessive development risks since a Reit is supposed to deliver stable income to unitholders.\"We feel that (a development limit of) 10 per cent is good enough. We also did an analysis where we stretched all the way to a 100 per cent (stake). Our gearing would be 43 per cent, and that's too high for comfort,\" she said. The trust's gearing will remain low at 35 per cent following the deal.Ms Leong added that the trust manager has not decided whether to distribute the divestment proceeds to unitholders or retain it for potential future acquisitions, but it is keeping in mind the loss of income that will result from some of the Reit's disposals.Derek Tan, DBS vice-president for group equity research, is one of those who would have preferred CCT to have more stake in the game. This is because acquisition yields in the market are currently low, with income-producing assets such as Asia Square Tower 1 and Straits Trading Building recently transacted at yields of around 3 per cent, he said.\"But this is a 5 per cent yield. You can't get a deal that's 5 per cent now. By undertaking a little bit of development risk, you are coming in at a lower entry price, but this is probably a better return on capital.\"Meanwhile, CapitaLand is reported to be in exclusive talks to acquire Asia Square Tower 2 from BlackRock.The current redevelopment plan is for a one million square foot, 51-storey development reaching 280 metres, matching the tallest buildings in Raffles Place such as One Raffles Place, Republic Plaza, and UOB Plaza One.It will have 29 floors of Grade A office space on the top floors spanning 635,000 sq ft of net lettable area; an eight-storey, 299-unit serviced residence run by CapitaLand's The Ascott; and 12,000 sq ft of retail space.The second and third levels will be a food centre that will house the former stallholders of the Market Street Food Centre that now sits within the property. The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources will own the food centre.From August this year until the development's estimated completion in 2021, those stallholders will operate from an interim food centre next to Telok Ayer MRT Station."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

But developers beware the nasty disputes that may arise among owners, argues NUS Sing Tien Foo.A view of residential housing in Singapore. (File photo: AFP)SINGAPORE: The residential en bloc market seems to be picking up steam this year.With the sale ofSerangoon Ville along Serangoon North Avenue 1 for S$499 million,the number of en bloc deals completed this year has increased to six, bringing the total value of such deals in 2017 to S$2.0 billion, a huge jump from the S$1.17 billion in 2016 and S$380 million in 2015.There are good reasons to believe that this is just the start of another en bloc frenzy, given the number of developments currently on the en bloc market and strong interest from developers.Yet, supply-side factors, in particular, the collective sale mechanism behind an en bloc negotiation, are essential ingredients for a successful sale. If not managed properly, any arising dispute among a property's owners can scuttle a deal, and go some way to temper confidence in the en bloc market.COMMON INTERESTSIn an en bloc sale, motivated by common economic interests, owners of either strata units in private non-landed residential developments or houses on contiguous land plots come together to jointly sell redevelopment rights of their land to a shared purchaser.While the latter case is rare, owners living next to each other in landed developments might find common interest in jointly selling their properties when the price is right.This was the case for eight owners who sold their terrace houses along Marne Road collectively for S$41.76 million in 2012, at a per square foot (PSF) price of almost $3,000.Home owners can reap a windfall by selling their properties collectively in these cases, because their existing property can be redeveloped into new, higher density residential developments. In 1995, five bungalows along Walshe Road was sold jointly for a cool $1,520 PSF, double the price of what each would fetch if they were sold individually.LUCRATIVE AFFAIREn bloc deals can be a lucrative affair for property developers and home owners in land-scarce Singapore. To date, 6,032 housing units have been involved in en bloc sales, with an aggregate transaction value of more than S$43.34 billion recorded since the first sale in 1994.En bloc sales activities have been concentrated in prime residential areas, especially in the city-fringe, where demand for housing is traditionally strong. In these areas, there is also a ready supply of under-developed land with old, low-density buildings and low realised plot ratios, which are potential targets for en bloc redevelopment.Although some say developers are likely to prefer smaller plots, the data tells us that appetite for large plots of land is growing. Despite the small number of en bloc sales in last three years, these en bloc sales are comparatively larger, both in term of total value and unit size.The average deal size in this period ranges between S$194.8 million in 2016 and S$380.0 million in 2015, which is significantly larger compared to the en bloc deals during the last peak in the housing marketfrom 2006 to 2007, where the average deal size was around S$90 million.A few large en bloc deals, which include Raintree Gardens (175 units, S$334 million), Shunfu Ville (358 units, S$638 million), Rio Casa (286 units, S$575 million) and Eunosville (330 units, S$766 million) contribute to this larger average deal size.BARGAINING, HAGGLING, BRAWLINGBecause there is much money to be made, one can also expect a fair amount of bargaining, haggling and even brawling to take place. En bloc sales require the collective support from a majority of owners, who must agree to jointly sell their properties and share the sale proceeds, based on an agreed method of apportionment.Based on the Singapore Land Title (Strata) Act, an en bloc sale can only proceed if 90 per cent of owners by the total area in a development that is less than 10 years old, or 80 per cent of owners in a development that is 10 years old or older, agree to sell.This in itself is already an improvement from the previous legislation prior to 2007 that required a unanimous resolution supported by every owner of a strata development to effect an en bloc sale.This stringent requirement had caused significant tensions between neighbours because minority dissenting owners, who sometimes consisted of just one owner in some cases, could veto an en bloc sale simply by refusing to sell their unit. The 64-unit Eng Kong Mansion was one of the earliest case, where two uncooperative owners of one unit vetoed the en bloc sale decision of the other 63 owners.Then there is the issue of the sale price. A high reserve price that entices owners to sign onto a collective sale agreement may turn away potential buyers.On the other hand, a lower reserve price that entices developers to invest time and money to study the profitability of an en bloc sale, can foster competition that drives the sale price up, if owners are sufficiently persuaded to sign on the dotted line.But often owners have their own price thresholds that must be crossed before they can agree to an en bloc sale.COMPLEX, CONSENSUS-SEEKING PROCESSAn en bloc sale can be a long-drawn, and sometimes, complex consensus-seeking process. Differences in the en bloc decision, if unresolved, can harm relations among neighbours and create tremendous tensions for people who see each other almost every day and share the same amenities and facilities.Some owners may harbour acrimony and hatred against others, who they see as standing in their way to realising a huge potential windfall.For some dissenting owners, many of whom are older residents who may attach great sentiment value to homes that they have lived in for many years, no amount of compensation can make up for the loss of familiar surroundings and the social networks they have established. In old, large developments, this problem can be acute.In mixed-use developments, commercial property owners can have significant bargaining power vis--vis weaker residential property owners. These include owners of big shops or restaurants who own and bear the expenses of commercial facilities in the development such as escalators, loading bays and cargo lifts or have large gross floor areas.Through their controlling share value, they can have great sway over the details of such en bloc deals, including the method of apportionment and the minimum price.In navigating these dynamics, some level of behind-the-scenes bargaining by authorised agents and shadowy horse-trading can work but it is often difficult to compensate the losers without taking too much away from the winners profit pots or running the risk of agents being accused of acting in bad faith.Monetary inducement can be an attractive carrot to entice dissenting owner to join an en bloc deal, as was the case in the course of the en bloc negotiations surrounding Harbour View Gardens in 2013.Yet, even after the sale goes through, some cases can end up embroiled for years in legal dispute and in the case of Gilstead Court, get called off, when dissenting owners who have strong legal grounds to contest the sale file lawsuits.BUT MORE SUCCESSFUL EN BLOC SALES EXPECTEDIn a rapidly urbanised city, en bloc sites provide an alternative source of supply of private residential land for developers and allow for the recycling of land plots populated by dilapidated houses.More en bloc sales are likely to take place in the coming years, when Singapores living areas become more urbanised, and demand for housing in matured housing estates or city-fringe increase. Properties located near MRT stations and public amenities like schools and shopping malls, in particular, are likely to face pressures of being sold en bloc.We can expect the number of en bloc sales to reach nine to 10 for the full year of 2017, with a total sale value of between S$2.5 and S$4.0 billion, based on the list of hopefuls and their tender exercise periods. Potential en bloc sites that have been put on the market in the past year are aplenty. The list includes Tampines Court, Florence Regency, Villa DEste, among others.However, an en bloc sale may take six months to a few years for completion. In the recent Shunfu Ville en bloc case, disputes brought up by a few objecting owners were only resolved by the Court of Appeal four years after the formation of an en bloc committee.So the success of private en bloc sales is not just dependent on demand-side factors like location and marketing timing. It is also a delicate management of supply-side complications, requiring delicate human intervention to bridge gaps and reach compromises between consenting and dissenting owners.Such factors are arguably the most important ones that ultimately determine whether a development can clinch an en bloc deal and see through the sale.Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo is the Deans Chair and Director of the Institute of Real Estate Studies at the National University of Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Investors are issued these digital tokens in exchange for Singapore dollars, with each token being entitled to the cashflow of the underlying real estate investment which it references. (Most of FundPlaces' projects for which it is raising funds are in Australia and the UK.)A blockchain is basically a way to maintain a database without a central authority. It makes it feasible to have a fully distributed database in which users always have the most updated version of the database.FundPlaces' co-founder and chief executive Brian Wee named three advantages of using blockchain:It makes it transparent for investors, as every transaction is recorded and visible on the chain;It reduces the cost of investment, since there are no asset managers involved; andIt improves the liquidity of real estate, because the capital outlay for buying a token is much smaller than that for an entire property.The response has been encouraging so far, he added. Within two weeks of launch, FundPlaces raised 200,000 (S$355,808) for the co-financing of a UK residential development project. It also raised about A$30,000 (S$32,534) out of a targeted A$500,000 for another residential development project in Perth. Both projects are targeted to offer returns of 15 per cent or higher.Asked for its stance on such instruments, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) cautioned caveat emptor (\"Buyer, beware\"), citing the potential abuse of such platforms for criminal activity.Its spokeswoman said: \"The anonymity afforded by such new technologies and products, as well as the potentially wider reach at faster speeds, could certainly allow criminals to abuse them to cloak their illicit activities and gains.\"Whether the offer and exchange of digital tokens on blockchain-enabled platforms constitute an activity to be regulated by the MAS depends on the facts of the case. MAS is closely watching this space.\"The regulator added that platforms and products that fall within the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and Financial Advisers Act (FAA) will have to be regulated, and be subject to obligations to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism.This will apply no matter where their investors are based - a pertinent point, given that online blockchain platforms essentially open the floodgates for investors from across the world to take part in deals.Gerard Ng, a partner in the banking and finance practice at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing, had helped FundPlaces draft its documentation and structure its transactions. He described the job as \"novel\" but \"not easy\". He said he had to start with the most basic of definitions, for instance by answering the question of whether the digital token, Tile, is considered to be a security, which would subject it to the SFA. He decided that it was not, because it was neither a debt nor equity instrument.Because FundPlaces does not dispense advice on corporate finance, he concluded that this would exempt it from the need to apply for a licence to operate, as required under the FAA.He said: \"Our laws were not designed with virtual currency or related technology in mind. Businesses that offer products and services using innovative technology have to deal with issues surrounding the uncertainty of the applicability of certain laws to such products and services.\"In this regard, the US appears to be a step ahead. The Securities and Exchange Commission this week said companies that raise money through the sale of digital assets must adhere to federal securities laws and must register the deals with the government, as should exchanges that offer trading of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.Mg Ng said: \"Existing legal regimes are still applicable and relevant, and must be looked at in detail. Structuring the transaction involved lateral thinking and copious research to understand the technology, the products and business model.\"He also referred to existing laws such as contract law to develop a set of rules to govern the legal relationship between his client, FundPlaces, and its investors; he also had to consider laws governing real estate in the jurisdictions in which the properties are located. Meanwhile, Reidao is beating its own path. Its co-founder and chief executive Darvin Kurniawan said that its blockchain platform is still at the proof-of-concept stage; it is planning to test it by acquiring three properties in Malaysia next month and allowing the community to subscribe to them.Unlike FundPlaces, which uses its own private blockchain platform - meaning that only its members have access to it and only the operator can add blocks to the chain - Reidao uses the public Ethereum blockchain.It also uses the gold-backed token called DGX, which is more stable than the volatile Bitcoin and Ether.How the process works: When the full amount for a property has been raised in tokens, Reidao liquidates this amount to buy the property in the local fiat currency.At distribution time, cash is converted back to gold and then to DGX, which is paid out to token holders.Mr Kurniawan said his company had contacted MAS when it started working on the idea, but the central bank did not \"make any real comments\" due to the lack of legislation to instruct the process.Reidao is now just observing the relevant rules, such as laws on trust entities, into which it plans to place its properties.Both FundPlaces and Reidao recognise the risk that \"dirty\" money can be laundered through their platforms. To overcome this, they have put in place know-your-customer (KYC) and due-diligence processes at the pre-registration phase. FundPlaces' Mr Wee said, for example, that his outfit requires its Singapore investors to have a local bank account, so the banks (and their own KYC processes) act as a \"first shield\".FundPlaces plans to expand to Australia, China or India. Mr Wee said: \"It is probably a little less risky now, because we are dealing mainly in Singapore and funds come in from people with Singapore bank accounts. But once we start going overseas, there will be much higher risks.\"Mr Ng from RHTLaw added that no platform operator can guarantee that its platform is not being used to launder money: \"Despite the negativity associated with payment using virtual currency due to the use of Bitcoin as payment for illicit goods and to launder money, the fact remains that virtual currency can be an ideal and a legitimate means of payment for goods and services,\" he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

With Suntec REIT expanding its footprint in Australia, he shares in this interview what he has planned for the REIT, his views on the property market and the impact of interest rate hikes on the REIT.Q1: You took over Suntec REIT from, Mr Yeo See Kiat, who helmed the REIT for a decade. How do you plan to take it to the next level?Under See Kiat's leadership, Suntec REIT has grown from strength to strength. Our assets under management grew from S$2.2 billion at the initial public offering in 2004 to S$9.5 billion today, making it one of the largest REITs listed in Singapore. The continuing focus is to strengthen the REIT's fundamentals and build on the strong foundations.Key to this is improving the performance of our properties through proactive asset management to increase the utilization rate and optimize the asset value whilst continually improving and delivering high property management standards and service levels. Since Suntec REIT's initial public offering, we have delivered a total distribution per unit (DPU) of 115.9 cents and a total return of 194.9%*.Q2: How is Suntec REIT tackling the threat from the rise of online retailing in Singapore?The retail sector continues to face pressure driven by factors such as manpower shortage and competition from e-commerce.Shoppers today enjoy offerings from both the physical and online fronts. To remain competitive and relevant, we have refreshed our tenancy mix with new-to-market concepts and flagship stores. We also launched Suntec Rewards, Suntec City's digital platform which brings together the community of retailers, shoppers, professionals, tourists and convention delegates. Since its introduction, more than 80,000 shoppers have signed up as members.For the first three months of 2017, Suntec City mall's committed occupancy improved by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter to 98.4% while footfall and tenant sales improved 7.3% and 4.3% year-on-year respectively. Suntec City also benefits from the completed asset enhancement works, excellent connectivity with direct connections to two stations along two MRT lines and ample parking facilities with over 3,000 car park lots. We expect the occupancy of the mall to remain strong as we sharpen our tenant mix to strengthen our value proposition.Q3: The local office market is expected to remain under pressure. How is Suntec positioning its assets to deal with this?Our office portfolio continues to perform well despite the challenging operating environment. Throughout the different property cycles, our strategy of proactive asset management has enabled us to maintain our Singapore office portfolio occupancy rate at above market occupancy level. Our Singapore office portfolio achieved 99.4% committed occupancy versus the overall CBD Grade A occupancy of 94.1% in the first quarter of 2017. We will continue with our proactive leasing strategy to renew leases ahead of expiry and maintain our high office occupancy levels.Q4: How big a role will overseas assets play in the portfolio of Suntec REIT and how will this impact the REIT's returns?Suntec REIT will continue to be Singapore- centric. We will continue to grow the REIT strategically and our current focus will be Singapore or key gateway cities in Australia where we have already established our presence.We expect the occupancy in Australia to strengthen as demand continues to be positive in Sydney and Melbourne office markets. As we have hedged a majority of the recurring rental income, the fluctuating Australian dollar will have a minimal impact on the REIT's Singapore dollar returns.Q5: With interest rates on the rise, will REITs as an investment vehicle lose their shine? How will rising rates impact Suntec REIT?For the long-term investment horizon, REITs is still a relatively attractive instrument. Based on our sensitivity analysis, a 1% point increase in interest rate would not have a material impact on Suntec REIT's DPU.As part of our prudent capital management approach, we have completed our 2017 and part of 2018's refinancing requirements. We are actively reviewing the refinancing options for the remaining loans due in 2018.Suntec REIT is managed by ARA Trust Management (Suntec) Limited, which is part of ARA Asset Management Limited (\"ARA\").

Two of the top 10 developers - MCL Land and GuocoLand - are technically foreign developers by virtue of controlling shareholding, but have operated in Singapore for a long time. More than half of all residential inventory is in the hands of the top 10 developers.Among Singapore players, Sim Lian Group came out on top in terms of residential landbank in one fell swoop when it purchased a former Housing and Urban Development Company (HUDC) estate that can yield more than 2,000 residential units.Oxley Holdings also made a swift comeback to its home market this year after a flurry of overseas ventures: it snagged six residential sites comprising three sites under private treaties and three via en bloc deals; of the three en bloc deals, two were for large sites secured with consortium partners. This brings its share of the residential landbank, based on its equity share of those sites, to more than 1,200 residential units - making it third in terms of landbank and fifth in overall inventory, including unsold units in launched projects.Ong Teck Hui, JLL's national director of research and consultancy, told BT that the earlier success of some foreign developers in securing sites under the government land sales (GLS) could have been driven by their thirst to secure market share and establish themselves, especially since they could be pure residential players.Major Singapore developers, on the other hand, are more diversified in their business and are in other real estate sectors besides residential.\"It was a matter of time before the local developers upped their game plan,\" said Mr Ong. \"If their reading is for unit prices to rise, they will push up their land bids to tie in with higher future prices. Margins need not be sacrificed, if the anticipated selling prices are high enough relative to land prices.\"JLL's analysis shows that of the eight private residential sites (excluding the Bidadari mixed-use site) sold under the GLS so far this year, half went to Singapore developers - a proportion unchanged from last year.But foreign developers (excluding local-foreign consortiums) have secured more sites this year than the last - half the eight private residential GLS sites so far - compared to two out of six sites last year and four out of nine sites the year before.In the collective sales market, which is less popular with foreign developers, Singapore developers swept six of the seven deals with a residential component; one site was snagged by MCL Land. Most other private land deals this year have also been secured by local developers.Savills Singapore research head Alan Cheong said: \"Singapore developers will continue to remain aggressive in their land bidding - the reason being their need to recycle their capital and keep operations going.\"When land prices are rising, they may sacrifice margins if they are motivated to get the site but when the project is ultimately launched a year down the road, selling prices are likely to have increased, thereby pumping their margins up again.\"Oxley Holdings executive chairman and CEO Ching Chiat Kwong told BT that the group's return to the Singapore residential market is stoked by what it sees as a market revival characterised by rising purchasing demand and diminishing housing stock. Its motivation to rejuvenate older estates into new developments fuelled its interest in en bloc sites, he said.City Developments has the most residential inventory (share of unsold units and landbank) here among listed developers, followed by Oxley Holdings and Bukit Sembawang.Some large Singapore developers, which are diversified across asset classes and markets, are sitting on small residential inventory compared to their smaller peers after years of derisking their residential portfolio in response to property cooling measures.Among them, CapitaLand has signalled a more aggressive approach to residental land-banking here. Its president and group CEO Lim Ming Yan had said in a results briefing last month that the group is prepared to be \"aggressive but disciplined\" when tendering for residential land. CapitaLand has 197 unsold units in launched projects as of end-July.Based on official figures, unsold private residential units were at a historical low of 16,929 as of end-June, fewer than half of the 40,430 units at the last peak of Q4 2011.Going by the new sales pace of 10,336 units in the past 12 months, it may now take only 1.6 years for developers to clear the unsold stock. This is half the average pace of 3.1 years in the past 10 years.Displaced owners of en bloc sites that have been sold this year may constitute some 1,500 households looking for replacement units, and this may accelerate the paring down of developers' unsold stock, though those looking for another unit to live in may go for the resale market, market watchers say.Knight Frank head of consultancy and research Alice Tan observed that local developers have been cautious for much longer than their foreign peers. As they step up to the plate, competition from foreign developers is unlikely to ease.\"Foreign developers see increasing attractiveness of Singapore residential market, as Hong Kong and Australia apply more onerous requirements on foreign buyers. They are now on the lookout for alternative markets, so Singapore is a potential market given its long-term positive prospects in terms of price recovery,\" Ms Tan said.Wang Lian, managing director of Fantasia Investment, a subsidiary of Chinese property developer Fantasia Holdings, told BT that the company is still interested in residential sites here.It is now training its eyes on high-end projects, as it sees a resurgence of demand from buyers who recognise the value of high-end homes.Fantasia is keen on both en bloc and GLS sites, and will likely participate with joint-venture partners, he added.Savill's Mr Cheong said that foreign developers - excluding those who have operated here for much longer - tend to focus mainly on GLS sites as they are still unfamiliar with the en bloc process, and do not want to risk further market uncertainty if residents appeal to the Strata Title Board.Agreeing, executive director of research consultancy ZACD Group Nicholas Mak felt that GLS sites with attractive locations and access to transport nodes will continue to pull in aggressive bids from developers; moreover, they can take possession of GLS sites much sooner than collective sales sites, and the GLS tender process is a lot more transparent.Some market watchers believe that alternative land supply from the collective sales market and other private land deals could help to rationalise developers' land-bidding behaviour.Maybank Kim Eng property analyst Derrick Heng believes the resurgent en bloc market could ease upwards pressure on land prices.Besides the six sites on the second-half 2017 GLS confirmed list that will add 2,800 units to inventory, another 5,000 units on the reserve list could also be triggered by developers, he estimated."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Now filled with high-rise residential units, the trail seeks to highlight the town's rural past - for instance, it used to be a hunting ground for tigers in the late 1800s. There are three bite-sized thematic routes for trail-goers to explore Tampines' heritage based on their interests, including a first-ever Green Spaces Trail that takes cyclists through scenic landscapes. The trail also seeks to celebrate lesser-known stories from the community, such as first-generation hawkers from the Tampines Round Market & Food Centre. Calling heartland tourists, which of the newly-launched Tampines heritage trails are you most looking forward to? http://str.sg/4V3JWe take a closer look at 10 other trails in the city, from the Ancient History Trail in Fort Canning Park to a tour of the Alexandra and Labrador areas, which documents the fall of Singapore during World War II. Key facts: Three mobile education trails were launched in June this year - the Istana Heritage Gallery trail, the Istana Park trail that showcases the Istana's history and the Presidents' trail, which covers seven locations in the civic district and tells a story about each of Singapore's seven presidents. The trails use GPS technology to provide suggested locations, augmented reality, image recognition and beacons.What's special about it: President Tony Tan, who was at the launch of the trails, said they aimed to make the Istana more accessible to the public, outside of the four or five times a year during the Istana's Open House. The Istana Park trail, for instance, takes visitors on a tour of the flora and fauna around the park. Key facts: The first official heritage trail of the 200-year-old precinct features more than 40 sites spanning 4km. There are three thematic routes called Serangoon in the 1900s, Walk of Faiths and Shop Till You Drop. What's special about it: Among the key heritage landmarks is the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial, which was built following a visit by India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1950. The Indian community here raised the money to construct it. The distinctive precinct also melds the old with the new, hosting trades from the past such as flower garland vendors beside modern businesses and housing conserved shophouses next to high-rise buildings. Behind the name: Little India was never designated by Sir Stamford Raffles in his 1823 town plan as an area for the Indian community, unlike Chinatown and Kampong Glam for the Chinese and Malays respectively. Before it got its name in the 1970s-80s, it was known as just Serangoon, after one of the earliest roads in Singapore. Key facts: The trail, launched in January 2017 to mark the 75th anniversary of Singapore's fall on Feb 15, 1942, covers Labrador and Alexandra. With over 23 sites to visit, the trail covers five areas - nature, military, maritime, industrial and public housing history and heritage - and takes about four hours to complete. What's special about it: Two 1.8m-high walls that lead into the Labrador Nature Reserve are remnants from 1886 when Fort Pasir Panjang - also known as Labrador Battery - was guarded by a heavy iron portcullis and a drawbridge. Other highlights are the 1930 Berlayer Beacon, which guided boats and ships entering Keppel Harbour in the mid-20th century, and a replica of the \"Long Ya Men\" granite rock formation, also known as the Dragon Teeth's Gate. Key facts: There are 10 trail markers spread across a 15km distance. The public can learn more about the history of places such as Chai Chee, Frankel Estate, Opera Estate, Kampong Bedok and Siglap.What's special about it: Bedok had its beginnings as an idyllic coastal town that fronted the sea - stories of pirates, fishing villages and coconut plantations abound. A famous 1923 story is related via a marker that describes when Nobel Prize winner Albert Einstein visited a Jewish community in Singapore and was impressed by the beauty of the coconut palms in Frankel Estate.Behind the name: One of the earliest mentions of Bedok was in Malay-Portuguese cartographer Manuel Godinho de Eredia's 1604 map of the region, which identified a \"Sunebodo\". This referred referred to a river - better known as Sungei Bedok today. While the name Bedok has been around for over 400 years, there is still debate over its origins - a common view is that it is derived from the Malay word bedoh, a wooden drum used to issue an Islamic call to prayer. Another account traces Bedok's origins to the word biduk, referring to a riverine fishing boat in Malay. Key facts: Launched by the National Parks Board on May 1 last year, the 3km-long trail aims to give greater recognition to some of the district's trees, such as the angsana and rain tree. There are monthly guided walks and markers at the route's 20 stops, which starts at the Istana's entrance and ends at the Raffles' Landing Site. What's special about it: Along the trail is an avenue of 22 heritage rain trees in Connaught Drive. Some date back to the mid-1880s and have witnessed key events in the district, including Singapore's declaration of independence from the British by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1963. Another stop features an old Indian rubber tree at the National Museum which can be traced back to 1955. Key facts: Beginning at Fort Canning Centre, the trail winds around the Fort Canning Service Reservoir and ends at Stamford Green. The trail covers 2km and takes 45 minutes to complete on foot.What's special about it: Fort Canning is home to Singapore's first experimental and botanical garden. In 1822, Sir Stamford Raffles grew nutmeg and clove at this site because these spices had great economic value. At that time, colonial powers seeking monetary gain wanted a share of the lucrative spice trade in South-east Asia.One of the Heritage Trees here is the ear-pod tree (Enterolobium Cyclocarpum) which has round pods resembling ears. The bark and pods produce tannin, a substance used to make soap. There are a few ear-pod trees scattered throughout the park.The Flame Of The Forest (Delonix Regia), named for its striking bright red flowers and spreading canopy, is another Heritage Tree. It is located near the Time Ball, a replica of the device used in colonial times to mark time. The ball would be raised and dropped at exactly 1pm.Behind the name: Fort Canning was named after Viscount Charles John Canning in 1860, who was both the last Governor-General of India and its first Viceroy. His new role marked a change in colonial rule in India. The British government took over from the East India Company, the powerful British company that controlled India's trade.Key facts: The trail begins at Telok Ayer Street and ends at Club Street. It goes through Ann Siang Hill Park, a Chinese enclave stepped in history. The trail is 0.6km long and the walk lasts 30 minutes.What's special about it: Two Yellow Rain Trees (Samanea Saman) stand at Telok Ayer Green. The tree has yellow leaves and they fold up before a rain storm.Visitors can also find nutmeg, cinnamon, tamarind and breadfruit trees.Behind the name: Telok Ayer Street was the landing site for immigrants in the 1820s. Telok Ayer means \"water bay\" in Malay, as the area was only a few metres away from the original shoreline of the Singapore River.Upon landing, the immigrants set up places of worship here to pray for safe journeys.On the street, two National Monuments, Thian Hock Keng Temple and Nagore Dargah Indian Muslim Heritage Centre, are located next to Telok Ayer Green.Hokkien immigrants built the temple in 1842, making it the oldest temple in Singapore. Further down Telok Ayer Street, Muslim immigrants from South India built the Nagore Dargah shrine in 1830. The shrine was reopened in 2011 as the Nagore Dargah Heritage Centre and it showcases the artefacts of the Indian Muslim community.Key facts: The trail begins at Cavenagh Bridge and ends at the Civilian War Memorial. Visitors can walk past Empress Place, Esplanade Park and War Memorial Park. The trail is 1.5km long and takes 45 minutes to complete.What's special about it: The Cannonball Tree (Couroupita Guianensis) is found behind the bus stop on Connaught Drive. The tree is named for its large, round fruits that resemble cannonballs.A unique sight is the Leopard Tree (Libidibia Ferrea). Its trunk comes in many shades of brown due to its peeling bark. The tree is just behind the Cannonball Tree.Behind the name: Empress Place, situated between Asian Civilisations Museum and the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall, was named in memory of Queen Victoria of England in 1907.Key facts: The trail begins at the Rain Tree, a Heritage Tree near the Fort Canning Centre, and ends at the former summit of Fort Canning Hill. The trail covers 2km and you need to set aside 45 minutes to explore it on foot.What's special about it: The Terap (Artocarpus Elasticus) produces elastic latex, hence its Latin name. This latex was applied on branches of trees in the area to trap birds that land there. The young leaves are pointed and become oval-shaped as they mature. This Heritage Tree can be found near the Fort Canning Service Reservoir.The Rain Tree at the beginning of the trail is also a Heritage Tree.Behind the name: Fort Canning Hill was known as Bukit Larangan, which means \"forbidden hill\" in Malay . The Malay Annals described the hill as the resting place of the legendary kings of Temasek, who were thought to have ruled Singapore in the 14th century. The Malays were afraid of disturbing the spirits, so they avoided the area.The Forbidden Spring, located on the west side of Fort Canning Hill, was once reserved only for the wife and consorts of the kings.Key facts: The trail begins near the Visitor Centre, near Nassim Gate. Visitors can leave by the Burkill Gate after their last stop at the Giant Mahang, a tree also known as Elephant's Ears for its ear-like leaves. The trail is 600m long and it takes approximately 30 to 40 minutes to complete.What's special about it: Singapore Botanic Gardens' rainforest is home to the largest native ferns in Singapore. These ferns can measure up to about 3m tall. They grow on trees so they are high enough to get enough sunlight to flourish. They do not have flowers or fruit, reproducing by spores that are found under the fronds.Behind the name: Nature enthusiasts, inspired by Sir Stamford Raffles' first experimental garden in Fort Canning Park, established the Singapore Botanic Gardens at Tanglin in 1859. The gardens first started as an ornamental one, and once housed a zoo and a band parade area.After the British government took over in 1874, the gardens also had a scientific role. Its director Henry Nicholas Ridley experimented on rubber trees and invented the herring-bone method of tapping. This method involved a section of the bark being removed, allowing the tree to be tapped for many years without it dying. Rubber tree plantations in Malaya later adopted his techniques, transforming the country into the world's leading rubber producer.Source: National Parks Board, Singapore Botanic Gardens, National Library BoardJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Asia Square Tower 2 is a 46-storey integrated commercial development comprising a premium quality Grade A office building and amenities including The Westin Singapore and a two-storey retail podium.The sale will be BlackRock's fourth property sale in Singapore since 2015. Last year, it sold its Asia Square Tower 1 in the Marina Bay district to Qatar sovereign-wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority for S$3.4 billion.CCT will fund the purchase through a combination of a fully underwritten and renounceable rights issue to raise gross proceeds of about S$700 million, external bank borrowings of S$1.12 billion, and proceeds of about S$340.10 million from the 50 per cent stake sale of One George Street, Golden Shoe Car Park and Wilkie Edge. DBS Bank Ltd., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and HSBC are advising CapitaLand Commercial Trust on the rights issue.Soo Kok Leng, Chairman of the manager, said: \"The addition of Asia Square Tower 2 is a strategic move that is in line with our portfolio reconstitution strategy to rejuvenate CCT's portfolio with the addition of newer and higher yielding Grade A assets.''One George Street and Wilkie Edge were divested at exit yields of 3.2 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively, and are replaced with the acquisition of this higher yielding property at an initial yield of 3.6 per cent, CCT said.Offering about 0.7 million sq ft of net lettable area (NLA), Asia Square Tower 2 enlarges CCT's attributable office NLA to 3.5 million sq ft.He added that with the acquisition, CCT is well anchored in all the key sub-markets in Singapore's Central Business District: Marina Bay, Raffles Place, Tanjong Pagar and City Hall; cementing its position as the largest landlord of prime office assets in Singapore.At S$2.09 billion, the agreed property value is lower than the appraised value of S$2.11 billion, or S$2,710 per sq ft, based on an independent valuation conducted by Knight Frank Pte Ltd, using the discounted cash flow analysis and capitalisation approach.The completion of the acquisition is expected to take place in November 2017 or a date to be agreed between CCT and BlackRock Asia Property Fund III L.P..Jeremy Lake, Executive Director of Capital Markets at CBRE, one of the agents working on the transaction for the BlackRock-advised fund, noted the market has been eagerly awaiting the confirmation of this deal.\"It provides another pricing benchmark which reconfirms that the recovery in office rents and prices is well underway and in the last few months more and more local and overseas investors have been asking us about office investment opportunities in Singapore.\"One or two owners have been tracking this deal pending making a decision to sell their own building.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It comprises six apartment units (of between 1,324 sq ft and 1,550 sq ft) and 13 retail units, most of which practise scrambled merchandising.The development's residential and commercial owners are looking for a price of S$65 million to S$70 million, said Strata AMC, the agency assisting in the deal.The consent the owners gave is subject to a five-day cooling period, after which the development will launch for tender.Based on its maximum potential gross floor area (GFA), the asking price range translates to a unit price of about S$1,390 per sq ft (psf) to S$1,500 psf.The development sits on a freehold plot with a land area of 15,548 sq ft. It has a current GFA of 25,123 sq ft, but with a plot ratio of 3.0, it can be built to a maximum permissible GFA of 46,643 sq ft, the agency said.ICB Shopping Centre is about 1 km from Nex shopping mall and Serangoon MRT station, and is also near eateries and other small retail shopping areas.Anne Loh, executive director at Strata AMC, said the location is convenient as it sits along the main road.\"The Upper Serangoon/Hougang precinct is a potential growth area ... The space can potentially be redeveloped into a medical centre, since there is no large hospital within the vicinity.\"Nicholas Mak, executive director of ZACD Group, said the project appears more suited to small to mid-sized developers, most of whom have been crowded out of the en bloc deals in the market because of the high asking prices.Mr Mak had earlier expected the sentiment for en bloc sales - especially of 99-year leasehold projects - to cool a little, following the hike in development charge (DC) rates announced in late August.Higher DC rates will increase the charges payable by developers for increasing the floor area of the new development, as well as for topping up the 99-year lease of the land.\"Yet, we see that this has not tapered demand; the en bloc momentum is continuing. This property may fall below the radar of medium-sized to large developers as its scale may not fit their portfolio or image, but it may work in the favour of smaller developers,\" he said.If this collective sale goes through, it will follow three other sales of mixed-use or commercial properties to go through this year.In May, a unit of BBR Holdings acquired Goh & Goh Building, a mixed-use property in Upper Bukit Timah Road, for S$101.5 million.In July, Citimac, a freehold industrial complex near Tai Seng MRT station, was sold for S$430.1 million to a foreign developer.This month, Elite Building, a freehold six-storey property near Aljunied MRT station, was sold through a collective sale for S$52 million to The Tabernacle Church and Missions Limited."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Investors eyeing Singapore hotel assets in Singapore thus tend to be high-net-worth individuals and Asian family businesses, rather than institutional investors, said Chee Hok Yean, managing partner of hotel consulting firm HVS Asia Pacific.\"Chinese investors are keen, but unless they have already moved their funds out of the country, they may find it difficult to do so now, given the tighter capital controls,\" she said.\"The investment draws in the Singapore hotel market are security, quality of assets, the strong Singapore dollar and the Republic's financial hub status\", she added.Grand Park City Hall in Coleman Street is understood to be on the market for at least S$1 billion, or what could be a record S$1.7 million per room.

The property, which has 60 years left on its site, opened barely three years ago and is owned by the listed Hotel Grand Central. It is being offered for sale with vacant possession of brand and management. This means the buyer can rebrand and reposition the asset.Both Savills and JLL declined to comment on their respective roles in marketing the two hotels.JLL was more forthcoming about the expression-of-interest (EOI) exercise it ran for Park Hotel Farrer Park, which ended a few weeks ago.Nihat Ercan, managing director of investment sales for Asia at JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group, said the exercise attracted strong interest from groups across South-east Asia and even the Middle East.Bidders were high-net-worth individuals, institutions, private-equity money and owner-operators looking for opportunities to flag their brands.Industry talk has it that about half a dozen parties took part in the EOI.The exercise in soliciting interest in the property was launched in July, after its owner, RB Capital, began receiving unsolicited offers just a month after the hotel opened.The property, directly linked to the Farrer Park MRT station, is valued at about S$390 million or S$1.3 million per room. The buyer can acquire the hotel with vacant possession or with a management contract with the Park Hotel Group.The Park Hotel Group, which is offering its Grand Park City Hall for sale, prefers to continue managing the property after its sale, in line with its push to go asset-light, The Business Times understands.Assuming the hotel's 343 rooms are priced at an average of S$1.7 million each, the retail component of about 62,400 sq ft net lettable area would be worth nearly S$6,700 psf. The hotel, which is being revamped, has 75 years' balance lease on its site.Preliminary stats on the Singapore Tourism Board website put the revenue per available room (RevPAR) for Singapore hotels in the first seven months of this year at S$199.60 - a 0.4 per cent year-on-year rise.Over the same period, international visitor arrivals climbed 3.8 per cent to 10.175 million.Julien Naouri, director of Savills Hotels Asia-Pacific, noting the lack of major hotel deals in Singapore since 2015, said: \"Investment sentiment appears to be returning. A lot of the new supply has been digested. Singapore's visitor arrivals continue to grow, occupancy rates are still high and room rates are stabilising.\"Some large hotels have been put on the market this year, but no deal has been sealed yet. Only three boutique hotels within shophouses have been transacted since January.Mr Naouri said: \"There is still a price gap , though this gap is narrowing. Last year, owners were seeking, say, 2.5 per cent yield, whereas buyers would have been prepared to pay around 4 per cent yield.\" (Yield is a hotel's net operating income or NOI divided by its price.)Today, buyers' yield expectation remains the same, but the yield sought by owners has risen to 3 per cent - not because they have lowered their asking price, but because of improved hotel trading performance, resulting in a higher NOI.He said: \"We are already seeing a revival in hotel investments in Hong Kong, with HK$14.3 billion in deals in the year to date - against just HK$1.3 billion last year. Singapore is lagging.\"Hotel investment deals here hit a high in 2013, with 13 transactions worth S$3 billion, going by JLL's data.Besides the Grand Park Orchard and Park Hotel Clarke Quay, other transactions that year included Sentosa Resort & Spa at S$210.85 million and that of Westin Singapore at Asia Square Tower 2 at S$468 million or a record S$1.534 million per room.Transactions thinned to S$248 million in 2014, rose to S$406 million in 2015 and fell back down to S$145 million last year. The three boutique hotel deals so far this year went for a total of S$158 million.JLL's Mr Ercan believes investment interest in Singapore hotels is set for a recovery. \"There is expectation of continued increase in visitor arrivals into Singapore and a relatively benign supply outlook.\"Therefore, trading fundamentals for the Singapore market are viewed as positive by the investment market; add on to that Singapore's gateway status as an investment destination - that is fuelling interest.\"We've had quite a bit of supply coming into the market in the past couple of years, (but as) we now look into the next few years, there really is not a lot of new hotel room supply coming up. So with the continuing visitor arrivals, that is really going to drive trading.\"According to data compiled by JLL, 4,545 new hotel rooms were completed last year - the highest figure since 2010.This year, 3,174 rooms are expected to be completed. Supply will be more limited beyond this year - 266 rooms next year, 1,576 rooms in 2019 and 290 rooms in 2020.Some consultants are upbeat that rising visitor arrivals will mop up last year's and this year's rise in room supply - boding well for the hotel market - but HVS's Ms Chee argues that it will take a while for the market to digest the supply: \"The outlook for 2018 may still prove to be challenging for hoteliers, given new room supply and labour costs, among other factors.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It may only be a matter of time before more will emerge with en bloc trophies in hand, market watchers say.Before 2016, there were more sites under the GLS programme than in the en bloc market, so developers hardly considered en bloc sites back then, JLL regional director of investments Tan Hong Boon observed.And with more attractive en bloc sites becoming available vis-a-vis the limited GLS sites, naturally more developers are exploring the en bloc option. Increased enquiries also come from foreign players trying to understand the collective sale process, he said.Foreign developers have historically been less comfortable with the en bloc process, a more cumbersome and protracted process than the straightforward purchase of land through the GLS. But since last year, the Chinese developers are starting to bite, signalling a paradigm shift.Chinese firm Kingsford Huray Development, owned by Chinese-citizen-turned-Singaporean Cui Zhengfeng, acquired Normanton Park, a former government housing project off Ayer Rajah Expressway, for S$830.1 million this month. This follows the purchase of freehold condominum project Sun Rosier for S$271 million by SingHaiyi Properties and Huajiang International Corporation, both controlled by Chinese tycoon Gordon Tang and wife Chen Huaidan. In May last year, Qingjian Realty bought former HUDC estate Shunfu Ville for S$638 million.Chinese developers are also keen to hold commercial properties here for recurring income. In July, a buyer said to be linked to the Zhao family from China acquired freehold industrial complex Citimac.Talk in the market is that the SingHaiyi joint venture was in such hurry to seal the deal for Sun Rosier that it came without representation from lawyers and without amendments to any terms in the collective sales agreement.Norman Ho, partner at Rajah & Tann, felt that the rush among developers - not only foreign developers - to replenish their landbank through en bloc sites is ironic given that they are spoilt for choice, with as many as 60 sites said to be in varying stages of the en bloc process.But competition for attractive sites may heat up as those Chinese developers that were active in GLS tenders in the past have warmed to the collective sales process, he said.Chinese players that are said to be scouring for deals include China Construction, Hao Yuan Investment and Nanshan Group. The latter is not new to the en bloc scene, having bought Irving Industrial Building through a collective sale in late 2014.MCC Land CEO Tan Zhiyong told BT: \"We have been closely observing the recent wave of en-bloc activities and will be keen to participate in a tender if an opportunity arises.\"But he is wary of over-exuberance in developers' bids. \"The current residential property market seems to be stabilising and recent new launches have also been well received. However, with a likely rise in supply of new projects coming into the market in the next couple of years arising from these en-bloc activities, how the future market will react to home prices that may rise in tandem with tender prices remains to be seen.\"Swee Shou Fern, senior director for investment advisory at Edmund Tie & Company, said that a majority of Chinese developers studying en bloc sites now are those who have been active in the GLS market. \"We may start to see Chinese bidders emerging as successful bidders in the upcoming collective sales sites. But they are selective - those I've spoken to only want prime location that is freehold.\"Hutton Asia head of investment sales Terence Lian told BT that he has received several enquiries from foreign developers for Jalan Besar Plaza, especially Chinese developers \"who are already well established here\".Some of them are drawn to the prospect of recurring income from a new development on the freehold mixed-used site, which may have a serviced apartment component subject to government approval. Another site that is of interest to them is Tai Wah Building, also because of the prospect of having serviced apartments on the mixed-use site.Some observers note that despite the initial apprehension among foreign developers towards the en bloc market, there are no real barriers to entry. They can gain access to local market knowledge through local consultants and lawyers or local staff. The Chinese players also have the capacity to take on large sites.Interestingly, Chinese developers may have crossed a mental hurdle towards the en bloc sale concept, as collective sales are not common in China or Hong Kong, a corporate lawyer said.The only bugbear, perhaps, is the uncertain redevelopment timeline for en bloc sites and how the market may turn by the time a project is launched. While it typically takes just three months for legal completion of a GLS site acquisition, it may take up to a year or even longer for legal completion of the acquisition for en bloc sites if there are disputes with owners.But will Chinese developers start setting new highs in prices for en bloc sites? For Normanton Park, its land rate of S$969 per square foot per plot ratio is the highest achieved for a 99-year leasehold collective sale site this year. One consultant noted that property owners attempting en bloc deals are starting to ask if there is any interest from Chinese developers, who are seen as having deep pockets to buy them out.JLL's Mr Tan felt that the Singapore government would not be worried just because they are overseas players; local developers have been bidding aggressively too. But the government is concerned whether prices are rising within an acceptable range or not.Agreeing, Mr Lian of Huttons do not see foreign developers as an irrational lot. \"Regardless of the plot's potential, it will not get a single bid if it is overpriced. Foreign developers will still do their sums.\"READ MORE: Fewer launches as developers await upturn"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It is likely to be sold as an investment property rather than on a redevelopment basis, given that it is already built to the maximum allowable gross floor area.Market watchers note that collective sales involving commercial properties tend to be more complex and time consuming than those involving residential developments.For one thing, there are not many such transactions in the market for comparison, said Cushman & Wakefield research director Christine Li. \"Different owners also have different opinions on the value of their units. Owners running existing businesses will also be reluctant to relocate if alternative locations are not viable.\"JLL regional director of investments Tan Hong Boon noted that another hurdle in collective sales of commercial buildings is in getting the owners to agree to the method of apportionment of sales proceeds. The agreed method will usually involve independent valuation at the outset, not just apportionment by strata area and share value, because the perception of value varies from owner to owner.In addition, ZACD Group executive director Nicholas Mak said many commercial collective sale attempts also fail because the asking prices are too high.On the plus side, Ms Li observed that owners of older strata-titled developments, especially those built before 1990, may see a need to catch the current wave as an exit strategy as their rental yields come under pressure due to competition from newer retail malls and office buildings.Goldhill and KatongGoldhill Centre's 87 units include three-storey walk-up shops and offices. The last en bloc sale attempt for the site, which consists of freehold and 999-year leasehold units starting from 1970, failed to find a buyer in 2008 when the asking price was S$315 million or S$1,496 psf of potential gross floor area.Katong Shopping Centre was Singapore's first air-conditioned mall when it opened its doors in 1973. Situated in Mountbatten Road, the 425-unit mall sits on a freehold plot of nearly 87,000 sq ft and houses among others, offices, employment agencies, printing and tailoring services shops, and eateries, many of which have been there for decades.This marks the third attempt by its owners. In their second try with a reserve price of S$630 million or a land price of S$2,248 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), they could not find a buyer willing to match the reserve price by the time its collective sales agreement expired in April this year so it reappointed Cushman & Wakefield.On why a sale didn't go through, Cushman & Wakefield director of capital markets Christina Sim said there was uncertainty over whether the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) would grant certain concessions for the site.This resulted in a \"mismatch of value between what the owners have and what any incoming buyer was willing to give\".The current use of Katong Shopping Centre is fully \"commercial\" with a baseline gross plot ratio of 3.223; but under Master Plan 2014, the site only has a gross plot ratio of 3.0 and requires 60 per cent of gross floor area to be \"residential\".Ms Sim said the URA has agreed to allow the incoming developer to maintain the plot ratio at 3.223. Though the 60 per cent residential component will remain, the URA allows serviced apartments to be built under the residential component.Smaller developmentsYear-to-date, the total 19 collective sales worth S$6.76 billion that have closed consist of 16 pure residential developments, one mixed-use building, a commercial building on a site zoned residential/institution, and an industrial freehold property.Ms Li said she expects those commercial developments that are about to enter the en bloc market to attract strong interest. \"Smaller commercial or mixed-use sites are of optimum size to satiate most small to medium-sized developers' appetites. These bite-sized developments are also rare in government land sales.\"Meanwhile, three mixed-use developments have been launched for collective sale. Jalan Besar Plaza and Tai Wah Building off Orchard Road - both sitting on freehold land - are asking for S$390 million and S$81 million respectively. Their asking prices work out to S$2,170 psf ppr and S$2,035 psf ppr respectively. Over in Yio Chu Kang, owners of ICB Shopping Centre are asking for S$65-70 million or S$1,390-1,500 psf.ZACD's Mr Mak, who also heads the firm's research, said that while there was a noticeable boom for commercial property investment sales between 2005 and H1 2008, many sales involved a single buyer and seller, and usually from one fund or company to another.There was also a steady volume of commercial investment sales from 2010 to 2013. But since collective sales of commercial buildings account for less than 10 per cent of total commercial investment sales, the boom period for commercial collective sales is less discernible.READ MORE: Roxy-Pacific buying freehold Dunearn Court for S$36.3m"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "SINGAPORE - Instead of sweat, mud and grime, Singaporeans joining the building and construction industry in the near future can expect a career of digital design and cutting-edge technologies which prioritise productivity and innovation over manual work.The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) targets to have 80,000 personnel trained in such technologies to enter the industry by 2025. There are currently 32,600 trained in these areas.The move is part of the newly launched Construction Industry Transformation Map (ITM), which is designed to pave the way for the creation of more attractive and highly skilled construction jobs in a sector that has seen dwindling interest from young Singaporeans, and low productivity resulting in a high reliance on low-skilled foreign workers.Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee introduced the road map at the opening ceremony of the Singapore Construction Productivity Week at the Singapore Expo Convention and Exhibition Centre on Tuesday (Oct 24).Mr Lee, who is also the Minister for Social and Family Development and has been playing an active role in the ITM's development, said: \"Essentially, we are speaking about transformation of the whole construction sector - the entire process and value chain, from end to end. This is not just a slogan, what we want to do is set the conditions for the entire industry to upgrade, to upskill, and to offer cutting-edge products and services to Singapore, and to the region, and to the world. This is particularly salient given the difficult market conditions that many of us face today, which make it imperative for us to start now.\"The plan has been around a decade in the making, ever since BCA started to explore the feasibility of using new construction paradigms, such as Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA), to boost productivity rates and change the industry into one that resembles a highly productive manufacturing line in a factory.This is achieved through technology like prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC), where large building modules manufactured in offsite factories are assembled in a Lego-like manner at construction sites.Built this way, construction sites can see up to 40 per cent of manpower savings since most of the work has been done already. This means faster completion times, fewer work incidents and a cleaner site.By 2020, BCA targets 40 per cent of all projects to adopt DfMA. Currently, only 10 per cent of projects have used or are using the method.Details of the construction industry transformation map were revealed on Tuesday (Oct24). Here are some key points:1. Build a higher-skilled workforce focused on digital technologiesThe plan is to attract more IT-savvy Singaporeans into the sector, with jobs that involve higher skills, more competitive salaries and a better working environment. A task force, comprising BCA, institutes of higher learning and industry associations, will provide more structured internships and creating a comprehensive training pathway for people to pick up new building technologies.2. Increase the use of more productive construction methods- Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA), a highly productive method of construction which moves traditional onsite work into offsite factory environments, should see 40 per cent adoption in all projects by 2020. The Government will also continue to roll out private land sales that specify the use of DfMA. There will also be up to 10 local prefabrication hubs by 2020.- The digitisation of the construction processes through IDD, which allows various stakeholders to collaborate from an early stage, has been mandated for certain key projects. BCA will develop standards to ensure interoperability of IDD systems, such as Building Information Modelling, and will pilot programmes that allow smaller firms unable to develop in-house software to test shared platforms.3. Build progressive and collaborative firmsThe Government will review public procurement practices to place higher weighting on non-price components, such as productivity and quality scores. A working committee will be set up to look at collaborative contracting models to facilitate greater cooperation among firms.The ITM also charts the adoption of other high-tech methods in the construction pipeline, including green building technologies, and a move to integrate designers, builders, sub-contractors and facility managers in the building's life cycle through an approach known as Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD).IDD can help stakeholders achieve savings by looking at the life cycle of a building at the design stage, said Mr Lee. Operations and maintenance of a building throughout its life cycle can cost up to four to five times more than actual construction, so with IDD, potential life cycle savings will be considerable.Said BCA chief executive officer Hugh Lim: \"What we don't want is for contractors to import more and more foreign workers to complete the job. We want to try to maintain the number of foreign workers at the current level, yet be able to cope with an increase in output as more big projects start kicking in.\"As of June, there are 296,700 foreign workers holding construction work permits.To meet this demand, \"a more technologically advanced workforce is needed\", said Mr Lim.Out of the 80,000 personnel in the industry, 35,000 will be trained in DfMA, 20,000 in Integrated Digital Delivery and 25,000 in green building technologies.A built environment SkillsFuture tripartite task force, involving BCA, institutes of higher learning and industry associations, will look into developing a comprehensive training pathway for new entrants and upgrading working adults.Said Mr Lee: \"What we are doing is ambitious, but this is necessary ambition. We all want the same thing - a vibrant and successful built environment sector. We want strong and profitable firms that thrive locally and overseas, we want good jobs for Singaporeans, we want cutting-edge capabilities anchored in Singapore. This will be no small feat and the journey will be tough, but we can do it together.\"Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Pearlbank Apartments in Outram has garnered enough backing from owners to launch a public tender with a reserve price of S$728 million, while How Sun Park, a development of 20 townhouses in Bartley launched on Tuesday, with an asking price of at least S$78 million.This marked the fourth collective sale attempt for Pearlbank Apartments, and the third attempt for How Sun Park.Alex Poh, chairman of the collective sale committee for Pearlbank Apartments, said that it has taken owners less than four months since July 8 to achieve the necessary signatures crossing an 80 per cent consensus, significantly faster than the previous rounds.\"The owners understand that it is time to sell, given the age of the property and hence have shown great commitment to ensuring a smooth and quick process,\" he said.The owners' reserve price of S$728 million for Pearlbank Apartments works out to a land cost of S$1,505 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), after factoring in an upgrading premium of about S$195 million for the lease top-up. There is no development charge payable.Colliers International, the sole marketing agent for the collective sale, said on Monday that preparations for the launch of a tender exercise are under way. The tender is expected to be launched in two weeks' time and to close before the end of the year.Pearlbank Apartments, the iconic horseshoe-shaped building located on elevated grounds near Pearl's Hill City Park, has 280 apartments and eight commercial units on a land area of 7,653 sq m (about 82,376 sq ft). The development has a 99-year leasehold tenure from June 1970 and is located next to Outram Park MRT interchange.While the development has a gross plot ratio of 7.2, under the 2014 Master Plan, it has an existing gross plot ratio of 7.4479. The site has the potential to be re-developed into a residential development with a total gross floor area of 613,530 sq ft or 730 new residential units with an average size of 800 sq ft, subject to approval from the relevant authorities, Colliers said.The apartment owners, who own units ranging from 1,323 sq ft to 3,993 sq ft, each stand to receive minimum gross profit of between S$1.8 million and S$4.9 million. Owners of the commercial units, which range from about 700 sq ft to 5,630 sq ft, can potentially receive S$1.2 million to S$6.9 million.As for How Sun Park, each owner of the 20 townhouses will likely get at least S$3.9 million, or more than double the property's current value of S$1.9 million if they have sold in the open market individually. The tender will close on Nov 28.Marketing agent Teakhwa Real Estate said that the owners of 19 units (or 95 per cent approval rate) have consented to the collective sale.The freehold residential site along How Sun Road in district 19 is near the new Bidadari township and within walking distance to the Bartley MRT station along the Circle Line. It has a land area of 54,942.7 sq ft zoned \"residential\" with the plot ratio of 1.4 and allowable height of up to five storeys. With a potential GFA of about 76,919.8 sq ft, some 102 apartments of 753 sq ft each may be built on the site.The land rate works out to S$1,052 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) if the estimated development charges of about S$2.92 million are included. Also, it will be pared down to S$1,014 psf if the 10 per cent bonus balcony GFA (gross floor area) is included.Teakhwa Real Estate's managing director Sieow Teak Hwa noted that developers have been bullish about the Bidadari location, with 99-year leasehold government land sales in the area being hotly contested.The Woodleigh Lane site was acquired by Chip Eng Seng in July for S$700.7 million or S$1,110 psf ppr; the nearby freehold Sun Rosier was also sold in a collective sale in September to SingHaiyi Properties and Huajiang International Corporation for S$271 million or S$1,325 ppr.\"Well-located freehold sites are getting hard to come by and have become more and more valuable, and we expect strong developers' interest for the site,\" Mr Sieow said.Year-to-date, the total 19 collective sales worth S$6.76 billion that have closed consist of 16 pure residential developments, one mixed-use building, a commercial building on a site zoned residential/institution, and an industrial freehold property."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The statement did not elaborate what these were.Said the spokesman: \"The goal (of the study) is to strengthen Orchard Road's positioning, offerings and visitor experience. This is part of the ongoing effort to study how Orchard Road can be developed into a vibrant lifestyle destination where Singaporeans and visitors alike can enjoy a signature street experience in a city garden.\"The findings and recommendations from the study will be incorporated into the blueprint meant to guide the development of Orchard Road over the next two decades.Said the spokesman: \"This blueprint will be shared for public feedback once ready.\"Plans to refresh Orchard Road's streetscape were announced earlier this year, including a notable idea to make the area a car-free zone in the long term.The agencies have worked with stakeholders on some \"immediate term initiatives\", including the use of the Grange Road open-air carpark for a creative pop-up event, the statement said.The ongoing Flashbang street market, which ends on Dec 30, features some 120 retailers and food and beverage operators.The statement said Orchard Road also features enhanced programming and events, including a Christmas village at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza as part of this year's Christmas on A Great Street.A scramble crossing trial at the junction of Cairnhill and Orchard Roads, similar to that in Tokyo's Shibuya district, will \"facilitate access to enhanced programming and enhance street-level vibrancy\", it added.The trial will take place on weekends and public holidays from Dec 16 until Jan 28.By the end of 2018, a design incubator to showcase and groom local brands and designers will be built at Orchard Green as well.The JTC Corporation will be calling for proposals by the first quarter of next year for an operator to manage the incubation space.Orchard Road Business Association (Orba) executive director Steven Goh said that the association and stakeholders had been involved in \"a series of engagements leading to this study of the rejuvenation of Orchard Road\".Improving the walkability of Orchard Road and relaxing zoning restrictions are among the suggestions that Orba has provided during these closed-door sessions, said Mr Goh.\"We are excited that the Government is engaging consultants to undertake this blueprint. We will work closely with URA and STB to see what else they need from us,\" he added.Orba is \"happy with the progress\" of the remaking of Orchard Road, first announced by Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S. Iswaran in April.\"Human traffic is extremely high this year, a sign that people are returning to Orchard to shop while tourists are being drawn by the festivities,\" said Mr Goh.If the scramble crossing trial is successful, Orba hopes the authorities can implement others at the Orchard Road intersections with Bideford and Paterson Roads as well, said Mr Goh.The blueprint is a significant one with long-term consequences, said Adjunct Associate Professor Steven Choo from the National University of Singapore's School of Design and Environment.He said that 20 years is a relatively short period for urban planners.Said Dr Choo, who gives lectures on urban planning: \"Changes happen as an evolution and not overnight - you cannot impose a mindset or pattern over a few years. Few remember that the first development plans for Orchard Road surfaced in 1968, but it took years to become reality.\"While still a major commercial belt, Orchard Road has come under siege in recent times with the growth of e-commerce, according to industry watchers.Upcoming regional districts and commercial nodes, such as Jurong, can also pose a threat to its status.This is why Orchard Road still needs to find a \"unique selling point\" to lure shoppers and tourists back to the street, said Dr Choo.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

It will occupy the site of the razed and demolished Block 493.Last year's fire affected the livelihoods of 51 stallholders, including those in Block 493 and the coffee shop stallholders in Block 494 next door, which was badly damaged.Many of the wet market stallholders have resumed business at a temporary wet market.Mr Ang told The Straits Times most of the affected stallholders have expressed interest in moving to the new complex.Asked about rental rates at the new complex, Mr Ang told ST as the construction cost of the Jurong Central Plaza is fully paid by HDB, he hopes the new market operator can moderate the rent of the stalls.It would be \"best\" if rents are similar to that before the fire, he added.Affected stallholders at the temporary wet market told ST that they have seen a marked dip in trade.Hawker Ang Hock Dee, 58, who has been selling fish for more than 30 years, said business has plunged by about 20 per cent since he moved to the temporary market, which used to be a basketball court.\"In the coffee shop area, business was very good. Now not that many people want to walk over here, especially the elderly,\" he added.This view was echoed by 82-year-old yong tau foo seller Neo Chwee Eng, who said renting his wider stall costs him about $800, about twice as much as what he used to pay.He now gets only around 60 customers a day, less than half of what he used to see at the old premises.Mr Neo said in Mandarin: \"We try not to sell things at prices that are too high. I can just about get by.\"Fellow hawker Mr Ang said he will consider moving over if the rent is reasonable at the new complex. \"Otherwise I might have to find another job,\" he added.The fire last October caused stallholders to lose hundreds to thousands of dollars of income a day. It broke out in the wee hours of Oct 11, and damaged a privately-run coffee shop at adjoining Block 494 as well.Singaporean Lim Ying Siang, then 41, was charged in October last year for setting fire to styrofoam boxes at the market knowing it would likely destroy the premises.Yesterday's event also marked the completion of refurbishment works from Blocks 492 to 498 in Jurong West Street 41. This was carried out under the Remaking our Heartland Programme, and included the addition of a Community Pavilion as well as more bicycle racks and yellow boxes for bicycles from bike-sharing companies.Mr Ang, the MP, said Jurong Central is the first division in Singapore to work with the three major bike-sharing firms to provide yellow boxes in void decks and neighbourhood centres for their bicycles.He said the scheme, launched in April this year, has been successful, adding that it has since been extended to the entire Jurong GRC as well as Bukit Batok and Yuhua SMCs. There are also plans to extend the scheme eventually to the rest of the Singapore, he said.Sunday's event also marked the launch of a fourth bike-sharing company, SG Bike, in Jurong.Meanwhile, the Jurong West Street 41 neighbourhood will be the first to undergo the revamped Revitalisation of Shops scheme initiated by the HDB last year.Shops will each have new signboard, vertical blind and awning, with the bulk of renovation costs to be paid by the HDB and Town Council.

He'd begun seeking his successor as chief executive officer of Hi-P International Ltd, a contract manufacturer for customers including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc. But an annual loss, and the US$126 million claim that Hi-P filed because of it, ended that plan.The self-professed troubleshooter attributes the company's first red ink since listing on Singapore's stock exchange mostly to one big error that he oversaw. Its electronics unit took on a contract to co-design and produce a dual-screen smartphone for Yota Devices Ltd without doing enough due diligence. The Moscow-based firm didn't take delivery of the phones, according to Mr Yao. Yota couldn't be reached for comment.Two years - and, according to Hi-P, about S$100 million in losses - later, the company is heading for its largest annual profit on record, helped by its work for Apple. Its shares have more than tripled in 2017, which is by far the biggest gain on the FTSE Straits Times All Share Index.\"We took unnecessary risk,\" Mr Yao said in an interview in Singapore.\"But I believed I could turn the situation around.\"Mr Yao says he secured financing from lenders including Singapore's United Overseas Bank Ltd. Then he changed the company's structure, creating four business units in order to target a more diversified client base and be less reliant on individual customers. He increased the company's focus on employee incentives and also developed a system to evaluate and limit exposure to counterparty risk.Finally, he started arbitration proceedings against Yota to reclaim some of the losses. They were settled this year for US$17 million and an agreement that Hi-P could sell its remaining inventory of the phone that it made for the Russian company, while keeping the proceeds.Those efforts, coupled with Hi-P's relationship with the thriving Apple, have led to a recovery. Mr Yao's company posted a S$54.5 million profit in 2016, and is expected to almost double that this year, according to estimates by DBS Group Holdings Ltd.As a rare Singapore-listed company on Apple's official list of its top 200 suppliers published in February, Hi-P has benefited from three new iPhone launches this year. Apple expects to post record revenue of as much as US$87 billion in the quarter ending late December, driven by the 10-year anniversary iPhone, as well as resurgent iPad and Mac sales, the US technology giant said in November.\"Hi-P is in a sweet spot now,\" Ling Lee Keng, a DBS analyst, wrote in a November report. More than half of the company's earnings are derived from the smartphone, internet-of-things and smart-home businesses, which are expected to continue to do well in the next two years, she said.Given the company's strong earnings, Mr Yao says he's considering acquisitions in the automotive and healthcare industries. He declined to identify targets but said he has a \"big dream\" and a way to achieve it.RAGS TO RICHESMr Yao, who owns 83 per cent of Hi-P, has seen the value of his shareholding surge to US$857 million. He was born in China but moved to Taiwan when he was five, and only arrived in Singapore at 39, when he was transferred there by DuPont, his employer at the time. He started to learn English \"seriously\" shortly after that.The 77-year-old says he has a fighting spirit - principled, but \"very aggressive\" - that was born from poverty in childhood and the relocations of his life. Everywhere you go, kids bully the newcomer, he said.\"Although I was small, I became a strong fighter,\" he said.Mr Yao left DuPont in 1983 and took over the management of Hi-P. It had been founded in 1980 with Mr Yao as a silent partner. The company, which started out making insert molding and metal tools in China and selling them in Singapore, almost went out of business during the worldwide recession of the 1980s. It flourished thereafter, listing on the Singapore Exchange in 2003. Today, it has about 15,000 employees and a market value of more than US$1 billion.\"He's always proved the market wrong,\" said Jarick Seet, head of small and mid-cap research at RHB Research Institute Singapore Pte.\"When everyone thought he was going to fail, he came back.\"Still, Mr Seet cautioned that Hi-P is too dependent on Apple. He estimates that at least half of revenue comes from the US company. Hi-P has worked with Apple since 2009, starting with the iPod, according to the Singapore-listed company.\"The key thing that is profitable for them is still mobile phones,\" Mr Seet said.\"They're diversifying, but it's still slow.\"While Hi-P's 247 per cent advance this year is about 14 times that of Singapore's Straits Times Index, it's still cheaper than the average company in the 30-member gauge. Hi-P trades at 12 times estimated earnings for the next 12 months, compared to 14 times for the benchmark gauge.With the business stabilised, Mr Yao has begun planning for succession again. He appointed Yong Inn Nam as chief operating officer in November. Mr Yong had been responsible for developing business with clients other than Apple, in another sign of Mr Yao's attempts to diversify. In a statement to the exchange, Mr Yao said that the company's leadership for the next generation is also being identified.\"I don't have an intention to leave the company to family,\" Mr Yao said.\"I don't have kids also. But what I want to leave is a legacy.\"BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Then, in a private treaty in January 2017, they purchased 45 Amber Road, a 70,000 sq ft free- hold site for $156 million ($1,063 psf ppr), from developer Sin Lai Huat. Fortunately, we bought these two pieces of land at relatively rea- sonable prices before intense com- petition drove land prices up, says Liam Wee Sin, deputy group CEO of UOL Group. UOL and Kheng Leong purchased Nanak Mansions for $201.1 million ($1,429 psf ppr) in September; it will be redeveloped into a 68-unit high-end condo (Photo credit: JLL) At end-September, UOL Group purchased Nanak Mansions en bloc for $201.1 million ($1,429 psf ppr) in a joint venture with sister company Kheng Leong Co, the privately held property vehicle of the family of Wee Cho Yaw, former UOB chairman. Prices of subsequent collective sale sites in the prime District 15 neighbourhoods of Amber Road and Meyer Road have since risen. In early October, Amber Park was sold for $906.7 million ($1,515 psf ppr), followed by the $146.99 million ($1,536 psf ppr) sale of Parkway Mansion in mid-December. Disconnect between prices of land and private homes Each new en bloc sale or government land sale seems to have set the benchmark for the next tender, fuelling the escalating land prices, says Liam. He sees a disconnect between the prices of land and the end-product private homes. According to URA data, private-home prices showed an uptick of 0.7% in 3Q2017 after 15 consecutive quarters of price declines. Based on transacted prices of en bloc sites sold in prime District 15 alone, free- hold land prices have soared 44.5% in terms of psf ppr over the last 12 months. Thus, Liam says, we will be more selective in bidding for sites with good attributes and where ask- ing prices are reasonable. UOL has been buying en bloc sites over the past 20 years, starting with the one for Novena Suites in 1997, followed by the one for The Sunshine on Upper Serangoon Road and 1 Moulmein Rise in 1999. The latest acquisition was Nanak Mansions on Meyer Road. En bloc sites have been a great way to replenish our landbank and a source of freehold land, says Liam. Newton Suites is a redevelopment of an en bloc site, one of 21 purchased by UOL over the past 20 years (Photo credit: UOL) Launch of Amber 45, Raintree Gardens UOL plans to launch two projects next year: 45 Amber Road (Amber 45) in 1H2018 and the new develop- ment at Raintree Gardens in Potong Pasir in 2H2018. According to Lim, with a plot ratio of 2.1, the site at 45 Amber Road will be developed into a 21-storey, 139- unit residential tower. The freehold project will have full-fledged condo facilities, including a 50m swimming pool and tennis court. The project is designed by ADDP Architects, which was the architect for The Clement Canopy, UOLs condo project at Clementi Avenue 1, launched in February this year. Like The Clement Canopy, the new project at 45 Amber Road will not feature one-bedroom units; the smallest will be two-bedroom units. At Raintree Gardens, UOL is developing a 20-storey development with a total of 728 units, given its higher plot ratio of 2.8. WOHA has been appointed the architect for the project, which will capitalise on its serene sur- roundings and the 20m riverfront. It will be a scheme inspired by nature featuring sky gardens and lush land- scaping, says Liam. UOL will develop the former Raintree Gardens into a 728-unit private condo with a 200m riverfront (Photo credit: JLL) WOHA was the architect behind UOLs other projects: five-star hotel Parkroyal on Pickering, Newton Suites and One Moulmein Rise, which are all award-winning projects. UOL has also engaged WOHA to design its new development at Nanak Mansions. Sitting on a prime free- hold site of 109,631 sq ft off Meyer Road, the site will be redeveloped into a boutique 68-unit, high-end condo. Likewise, it will be a sustain- able design with a focus on green- ery, says Liam. Existing launches substantially sold The developer has also benefited from the pickup in both sentiment and buying activity in the residential market. Its 555-unit Riverbank at Fernvale, launched in February 2014, is fully sold and was completed in March this year. The 797-unit Botanique at Bartley, launched in March 2015, was 70% sold as at end-September, according to UOLs 3QFY2017 results announcement. It has since been fully sold and is scheduled for comple- tion by end-2018. At Principal Garden on Prince Charles Crescent, only three of a total of 663 units are available for sale. The project is a joint venture between UOL and Kheng Leong, and was launched in October 2015. Meanwhile, the 505-unit The Clement Canopy, a joint venture between UOL and UIC, was launched in February this year and is already 84% sold. All these projects such as River- bank, Botanique at Bartley, Principal Garden and The Clement Canopy are 99-year leasehold condos devel- oped on sites purchased in govern- ment land tenders. Liam: We will be more selective in bidding for sites with good attributes and where Roll-out of maiden London project Beyond Singapore, UOL is looking to launch its project in London called One Bishopsgate Plaza, a redevelopment of the former Heron Plaza, which was purchased in August 2014. The 42-storey One Bishopsgate Plaza will comprise 160 apartments and 236 hotel rooms branded Pan Pacific London. The key advantage is its location in the City of London, right next to Liverpool Station and linked to Crossrail with direct access to Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf, says Liam. He adds that UOL is still confident about the UK market. In the micro-market of Bishopsgate, theres still scarcity in terms of both hotel rooms and apartments, he says. We believe housing demand will still be healthy. In Shanghai, UOL has a mixed- use development in the Changfeng Ecological Business Park called Park Eleven. It is a joint-venture project with Kheng Leong and UIC. The first phase of 168 units was launched in October 2016 and more than 90% was sold. UOL plans to launch the second phase next year. The devel- opment has 398 residential units and 4,000 sq m of retail space. In Singapore, Liam sees buying momentum continuing into 2018. But if developers are buying land at higher price points, they will be testing their products at higher prices, he says. So, we still have to wait and see how things pan out.

As a result, MTI may have decided not to place any such plots on the Confirmed List.She added: \"The measured H1 2018 IGLS programme is seen as a positive for the industrial property market as it would allow the market time to soak up the available space amid the more upbeat economic outlook. This would help to mitigate any downward pressure on industrial rents and prices in 2018.\"The latest official JTC statistics for Q3 2017 had shown overall industrial rents falling for the 10th straight quarter, while the islandwide vacancy rate hit a decade high of 11.4 per cent.Many observers think that the market could be at the tail end of the spike in supply completions which had started from 2014 and peaked this year.Net new supply - meaning completions less withdrawals due to demolition, change of use, or other reasons - likely hit above 2 million sqm for the full-year 2017. This refers not just to completions on state land, but also those on private land, redevelopments, and land allocations from JTC.Because construction of new properties has been slower in the last couple years due to a weaker manufacturing environment and consequent weaker demand from industrialists, supply completions from 2018 onwards is expected to taper off.ZACD Group executive director Nicholas Mak said this may explain why the government opted to put the larger sites of 2 ha and above in the Reserve List - to prevent a possible glut. He thinks that at least one Reserve List site could be triggered in the next six months, given the complete absence of bigger sites in the Confirmed List."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

They were found to have engaged in price fixing for more than a decade.The five firms are Panasonic Industrial Devices Singapore and Panasonic Industrial Devices Malaysia, Rubycon Singapore, Singapore Chemi-con (SCC), Nichicon (Singapore), and ELNA Electronics (S). SCC was fined $6,993,805; Nichicon, $6,987,262; Rubycon, $4,718,170; and ELNA, $853,227.Panasonic was not fined as it had applied for immunity under CCS' leniency programme, which incentivises cartel members to report such activity for lower fines. All parties except Nichicon had their fines reduced after applying for leniency.The cartel activity started in 1997, when senior-level employees of the companies attended meetings in Singapore on an almost monthly basis until 2013. But Panasonic and ELNA stopped attending them from February 2009.The long infringement period and the high turnover of the firms led to the hefty fines.The CCS said their combined turnover for AEC sales in Singapore - in the year before each company's infringements ended - was $60 million to $70 million. The CCS began its probe in May 2014 after Panasonic applied for immunity in October 2013.Investigations showed the firms had met to agree and exchange information on price increases for AECs between 2006 and 2008, among other things.There were also meetings of a similar nature held in Japan by some of the firms' Japanese parent companies.CCS evidence showed discussions on price rises of between 3 and 20 per cent. The firms also agreed to resist price reduction requests from customers \"to refrain from competing with each other for a war of attrition with absurd price reduction\".The companies were found to have infringed section 34 of the Competition Act.CCS chief executive Toh Han Li said: \"Cartels among suppliers cause serious harm to competition in the market, leaving businesses and end-consumers in a poorer bargaining position and facing less competitive prices.\"The four firms have two months to pay the fines, pending appeals. Rubycon, Nichicon and ELNA are being investigated in the United States for fixing prices of capacitors.ELNA Electronics (S), Rubycon Singapore and SCC declined to comment. Nichicon (Singapore) could not be reached.Panasonic said it made a leniency application after an internal investigation. The firm was not able to answer why it withdrew from the cartel in 2009.A local agent for one of the firms said that as a result of the cartel behaviour ending in 2013, prices for the capacitors have gone down by about 10 per cent.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

When approached, an MAS spokesman said: \"MAS expects banks to adopt sound credit underwriting standards in their lending practices. As part of our ongoing surveillance and supervisory work, MAS collects data from banks to monitor their lending practices to specific sectors from time to time.\"The central bank had, in its Financial Stability Review published in November, highlighted that recent developments in the property market pose potential risks to stability, and that market players should take a medium-term view of demand-supply dynamics and act with caution.\"Banks should continue to maintain prudent underwriting standards and review their valuation practices to ensure that property appraisals remain realistic and substantiated,\" the spokesman reiterated. \"MAS will monitor the banks closely.\"Industry players believe that the MAS is paying more attention to the en bloc and government land sale (GLS) tenders because of the steep LTV ratios on development loans in some cases. Some market watchers go further to speculate that one of the ways the Government can douse feverish land bids is by having borrowing limits on development projects.\"It won't be surprising if the MAS follows in the footsteps of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),\" one of the sources said.The HKMA has lowered the caps on bank loans to property developers from June 1 last year, as it seeks to contain risks in the booming real estate market. That, however, did not stop a subsequent land deal there from setting a new high.DBS senior vice-president for group equity research Derek Tan observed that favourable funding has enabled the developers to achieve high returns on equity (ROE) on development projects.\"If there's greater prudence in the LTV ratio, developers will need to come up with more capital. Their ROE will drop, and this will cause developers to be more cautious when bidding for land,\" Mr Tan said.There are existing safeguards on bank lending to the property sector. Under the Banking Act, banks' total exposure to the property sector is capped at 35 per cent of total eligible assets; there are also restrictions on exposures to single counter-party groups to prevent concentration of risks.In addition, the MAS expects banks to adopt sound valuation processes, such as engaging independent valuers, relying on multiple valuations for each site or property, and checking that valuations are reasonable.BT understands that as a general industry practice, an average of multiple valuations by independent valuers is usually used for very large projects. There is no obligation for multiple valuations to be obtained so long as the valuation report is addressed to the bank from an independent and established valuer.OCBC Bank head of real estate Richard Cheok told BT that every loan is assessed on its risks and the bank conducts a thorough credit evaluation before extending financing to its customers. \"The same applies to loans extended to property developers and construction companies,\" Mr Cheok said.\"For the financing of any property development project, the factors that we take into consideration include the project sponsor's financial standing and track record, the sustainability of the project and collateral and/or other loan support arrangements. In addition, we are also guided by internal lending parameters which are periodically calibrated to reflect market and economic conditions.\"One foreign bank, which declined to be named, said that other considerations in extending a loan include the availability of meaningful corporate recourse, the location of the asset, and the acquisition price vis-a-vis the expected gross development value of the project and that of nearby projects.\"For transactions backed by corporates with meaningful balance sheet, some banks have been willing to extend financing beyond the typical LTV ratios,\" the foreign bank said.Banks also subject their loans portfolios to regular reviews, stress-tests and ad-hoc scenario assessments to optimise their lending criteria, some bankers say.A DBS spokesman told BT: \"DBS remains vigilant to any signs of market weakness in the property market and we continue to exercise prudence when underwriting new loans.\"The group-level balance sheets of most Singapore-listed local developers have not shown major spikes in net gearing ratios yet, with the exception of a few boutique to mid-sized firms.One senior management executive at a real estate company noted that developers are a mixed bag when it comes to leverage, with a few being highly geared while others are flush with cash. The question is whether the Government should regulate the entire market just based on the aggressive leverage of a few developers or projects, he said.Hong Kong's example also demonstrates that lending curbs may not always be effective, he added.With effect from June last year, the HKMA cut construction financing caps to 40 per cent of land value and 80 per cent of construction cost, with an overall cap lowered to 50 per cent of the expected value of the completed properties.It also tightened the screws on mortgages in May, taking aim at borrowers with multiple loans and whose income sources come from outside the city. But land and home prices in Hong Kong have continued to shoot through the roof.Land deals in Singapore have also been keenly contested by local and foreign developers, with new price benchmarks reached last year. That has stoked a series of warnings from the Government on the risk of excessive exuberance in the property market."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(File Photo: TODAY)SINGAPORE: 2017 has been a year of revival for the Singapore property market.A surge in transaction volume in the private housing market after the third quarter may have seemed like the first sign of optimism. But the pick-up came much earlier as prescient developers snapped up lands put up for en bloc salestarting in the second quarter.With 37 tenders worth more than S$8.7 billion being awarded last year and even more properties put up for collective sale since, the en bloc frenzy seems unstoppable not least because of property owners who have been waiting all this while and are more than happy to cash in on the hype.2018 is therefore the year to watch for signs of the market cooling off.In recent months, experts have warned against getting swept up in the en bloc frenzy and urged for investors and authorities to look out for tell-tale signs of a property market bubble.They advise caution, having borne witness to the two previous waves of en bloc frenzies in 1997 and 2007.In the three years preceding the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, almost 100 en bloc sales were completed.Just before the Global Financial Crisis hit in 2007, almost 170 properties changed hands in collective sale deals, with the fever reaching a total transaction price of S$12.61 billion in one single year.Although the 2017 en bloc round seemed small compared to the last two waves, the words of experts urging for clear heads have credence.The deals closed thus far over the past year involved much larger sites, exposing developers to significant financial risk.Aggressive land banking by developers have not let up, even as their costs have reached record-breaking collective sale prices.Will the en bloc fever cause future housingprices to edge up especially when aggressive developers continue to place sky-high bids? Will these cause rising prices to spill over to neighbouring projects?Alternatively, when this round of musical chairs stop, will developers be stuck with large tracts of property, forced to sell at significant discounts?UPTICK IN PRIVATE HOUSING PRICESLIKELYIn the near term, we think there is room for optimism as this round of en bloc saleslooks set to boost prices in the private housingmarket.We can expect theuptickto fuel even more collective sale activities.More of such deals are already being put together by en bloc sale committees and real estate consultants in 2018.Past data supports this optimistic projection - a bumper crop of en bloc sales in 2007 seemed to have underpinned a strong upward price trend in the private housingmarket that subsequently peaked in 2008.Meanwhile, it is premature to argue that the en bloc frenzy in 2017 will lead to overheating in the private housingmarket, given the strong slew of anti-speculation measures that are still in place since February 2010.As Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong may have subtly hinted, the high bids put in by developers might not translate into higher sale prices down the road when developers are incentivised to maintain realistic expectations or risk getting penalised.Bear in mind that developers are also subject to the Additional Buyers Stamp Duty, he added in a reply to a parliament question on the en bloc frenzy in November 2017.Developers are only eligible for theAdditional Buyers Stamp Duty remission ruleif they complete and sell all units of their developments within five years from theland purchase.Let's alsonot forget that authorities can make adjustments to the amount of land released via the Government Land Sales to correct supply imbalances in the private housingmarket and curb rising prices in a hot market.All these should temper the chances of a scenario where developers are stuck with properties they cannot sell for a price that recoups their cost or a situation where prices soar beyond what is affordable for a Singapore household in the middle to high income bracket.There is also reason to believe that new developments at old en bloc sites are likely to continue to command a premium, where many provide a rare source of high-quality landin usually well-developed estateswith dense transport links.URBAN REDEVELOPMENT A LIKELY WINNERIn fact, well argue there is also good reason to keep the en bloc frenzy on a slow boil and to keep the music going.News coverage and commentary on en bloc sales usually spotlight on property owners, an obvious group of winners who benefit from the sale proceeds, save the few reluctant to move out of a long-held home.But what most news coverage ignores is that an en bloc sale is a cure for mounting maintenance costs for an ageing property reaching a critical half-life milestone in their leases.En bloc deals also aid in the Governments goal of urban redevelopment and renewal, particularly in older estates.These provide useful injections to old, low-density neighbourhoods, attracting younger families with higher incomes andstimulating commercial interests in those areas. They also go some way inrejuvenating local communitieswhile getting rid of older, more dilapidated buildings.Through en bloc sales, the gentrification of mature estates may not only be a common occurrence but an encouraged phenomenon.En bloc salesmay be an effective tool for urban redevelopment, if coupled with infrastructure and transport planning that keeps up with changing demographics in a neighbourhood.The local community also stands to benefit.Land developments taxes collected by the Government from granting higher density developments and extending the lease period of land plots can be indirectly redistributed back to the neighborhood through investments in better local amenities and public transport networks.The Government also has a say in refusing redevelopments of older en bloc sites, if new developmentsincur signiicant negative externalities in terms of traffic congestion and overcrowding.In November 2017, the URA introduced a new rule requiring a pre-application traffic impact study before anen bloc redevelopment application can be processed.So it seems not only will this round of musical chairs continue for a while, boosting prices in the private housingmarket,but its also in Singapores urban redevelopment interests to keep the music going.Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo is the Deans Chair and Director of the Institute of Real Estate Studies at the National University of Singapore.

His mother, a hairstylist, remarried but was unable to keep her three children together as her second husband had difficulty holding down a stable job.\"When I was around 14, I told myself that I wanted to be rich... I wanted to earn a lot of money so that my mum could relax,\" he said.During the school holidays, he took on jobs that required him to learn how to shampoo and colour customers' hair. He recalled a time when the family had no home and were forced to sleep in the salon where his mother worked. He and his siblings lived with different relatives for several years until his mother was able to get her own flat when he was 14. She retired about three years ago when she was 60.Mr Heng, now 38, is director of Camford International College, which offers online programmes. He was in the pioneer batch of employees at Camford when it was founded in 2000, and he worked his way up from course consultant to marketing manager and then to regional marketing director.When his boss retired in 2012, Mr Heng and two partners acquired the business.The business has affiliations with Briton Language School, Perfect International Beauty & Cosmetology Academy and CES Group. Last year, Camford and Briton - which together have nearly 2,000 students - achieved a turnover of $4.3 million.In addition, Mr Heng is a shareholder of language school Pusat Bahasa Titian Jaya, which has nine outlets in Malaysia.He is married and has two sons, aged seven and 10.It is a four-room Housing Board BTO (Build-To-Order) flat in Woodlands which I successfully balloted for in 2007, and I obtained the keys in 2011. I bought it for about $240,000 and it is fully paid up. I got married in 2006.I like my flat as it is near my parents who live in Yishun and my in-laws who live in Woodlands.From my home on the 26th floor, I get to enjoy nice views of the Customs as well as the sea. I can see whether there is a jam along the Causeway before I decide to drive to Malaysia.I bought my first private property in April last year for $883,000. It is a 99-year leasehold, two-bedroom, 710 sq ft condominium in the West Coast area and the project is called Parc Riviera. It will obtain its temporary occupation permit (TOP) in 2020. I plan to rent it out.I'm hoping to capitalise on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR), which is estimated to be ready in 2026. My condo will be near the International Business Park and the HSR station. There is almost 48ha of land for future mixed developments in the area, turning Jurong into Singapore's second Central Business District. This will hopefully mean good appreciation for my property. I estimate I can rent it out at $2,300 to $2,600 a month.I also bought a 226 sq ft retail unit in The Bridge in Cambodia in April last year for US$125,000 (S$166,000) from the Oxley Group. It is expected to obtain its TOP in the first quarter of this year. It is fully paid up. I want to tap the potential high-growth economy in an emerging country in South-east Asia. The Bridge is located in one of the best locations in Phnom Penh and close to tourism spots such as NagaWorld 1 & 2.In 2020, Shangri-La Hotel will be ready and operate next to The Bridge. This will potentially add value to my property because of the high human traffic and higher level of commercial activities.A Cambodian firm will manage my retail space for 10 years and provide good stable income yield of up to 6 per cent a year for the first five years and 8 per cent net returns a year for the next five years.I tend to look out for opportunities where there's higher potential capital growth in the future. For example, if the area has upcoming plans for commercial and transport development, they will boost future rental and capital growth. I also look for stable rental income.What goes down will eventually come up, but I don't expect a sharp rise as seen about nine years ago in 2009. The third quarter of last year saw the first property price rise in nearly four years and a new record was set for land sales last year, crossing the $1 billion mark. I believe we will see slow growth in the property market. For those looking to buy, affordability is an important factor. I took a $700,000 bank loan for Parc Riviera. It comes with a 1.6 per cent fixed deposit-linked rate and has a 27-year tenure.I bought a basic home insurance, which offers cover against fire and other perils such as accidental water damage. It's necessary to buy such insurance to provide peace of mind.Because of my family background, I consider myself thrifty. I don't pamper myself and will prefer to spend on holidays with family and loved ones.I invested in a few investment-linked insurance policies (ILPs), which provide $1.1 million of term life cover. Through these ILPs, I invested in unit trusts that focus on stable growth. I have 15 insurance policies that cover me against death, critical illness ($400,000), travel, personal accident ($1 million), as well as my children's hospitalisation. I like reading books by Robert Kiyosaki and I attend talks by Anthony Robbins.A bungalow or landed property in a good neighbourhood in Singapore.

With an additional lease top-up premium estimated at S$201.4 million, the sale price translates to a land price of about S$1,515 per sq ft per gross floor area.Subject to certain conditions, CapitaLand plans to redevelop the site into a high-rise residential development, comprising about 800 units with \"social, shared facilities\".The 37-storey development was sold following the close of its collective sale tender on Dec 19, 2017. The building comprises a total of 288 units (280 apartments and eight commercial units), and has a 99-year leasehold tenure with effect from June 1970.Owners of apartment units, which range in size from 123 sq m to 371 sq m (approximately 1,323 sq ft to 3,993 sq ft), stand to receive between S$1.8 million and S$4.9 million from the sale.Owners of commercial units with sizes ranging from 65 sq m to 523 sq m (approximately 700 sq ft to 5,630 sq ft), will potentially receive between S$1.2 million and S$46.9 million.The site of the apartments is subject to the Pre-Application Feasibility Study (PAFS), which was announced by the Urban Redevelopment Authority on Nov 13, 2017.Mr Alex Poh, chairman of the Pearl Bank Apartments collective sale committee, said: \"The introduction of the PAFS - just weeks before the close of the public tender - was a setback for the collective sale as interested parties needed more time to assess its impact. Despite the challenges, we are pleased that Colliers, with its extensive network of investors and real estate expertise, managed to secure a deal through private treaty. This is a very good result for the owners amid a red-hot collective sale market.\" While residents had previously explored the idea of conserving Pearl Bank Apartments due to its history and design, \"recent sentiment has strongly shifted to redevelopment\", he said.\"A deeper analysis of the building structure and the required enhancement work shows that conservation would be a costly undertaking and a huge burden for the owners. It is not a viable nor favourable option for the residents.\"In addition, the redevelopment of the ageing building will also be in line with the ongoing renewal of Outram. The future development will enhance the architectural transformation of the area and the owners strongly support the redevelopment of Pearl Bank Apartments,\" added Mr Poh.The site is located near Outram Park MRT station, which is linked to the East-West Line and North-East Line. It will also be connected to the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line, which will open in phases starting from 2019. Pearl Bank Apartments sits on elevated grounds with a land area of 7,653 sq m (approximately 82,376 sq ft).While the development has a gross plot ratio of 7.2 under the 2014 Master Plan, it has an existing gross plot ratio of 7.4479. Thus, the site has the potential to be redeveloped into a residential development with a total gross floor area of 56,998.8 sq m (approximately 613,530 sq ft).The tender for Pearl Bank Apartments was launched on Nov 16, and closed on Dec 19 at 3pm.

Its gross plot ratio is 7.4479.The building was designed by local architect Tan Cheng Siong of Archurban Architects Planners. While he was tasked to fit the maximum number of apartments within the site, he also ensured that its unique horse-shoe design fulfilled a purpose.The block's horse-shoe opening faces west, shading the building from the afternoon sun.In an interview with The Straits Times in 2012, Mr Tan said that he was influenced by French architect Le Corbusier, a pioneer of modern architecture.The bold design was a statement of nationhood, he added.\"This was the new Singapore. We wanted to show that it has what it takes to survive,\" he said.Great thought also went into the layout at Pearl Bank Apartments. The living rooms and bedrooms are at the front, giving unobstructed city views.At the 37th floor, one gets a bird's eye view of the southern part of Singapore, with a view of the sea on a clear day.Utilities and service areas are situated at the rear, overlooking a courtyard.Pearl Bank Apartments was first put up for collective sale in 2007, before two more attempts in 2008 and 2011.This rallied a small group of residents to save the landmark building, led by American architect Ed Poole. He hired a lawyer and even started a website pearlbankapartments.com to raise awareness of its architectural importance.In a 2014 Straits Times report, Mr Poole, who lives in a penthouse unit, said: \"Pearl Bank is irreplaceable.\"There is no way you can find another apartment like Pearl Bank in Singapore.\"In 2015, the owners sought a conservation order for the building and at the same time applied to increase its gross floor area.As part of their vision, they hoped to sell this extra development quantum to a developer, who could then build a second apartment block on top of their five-storey carpark.With the proceeds, the owners will then retrofit the existing building.However, plans to gazette it for conservation did not materialise as the liaison committee failed to obtain the required 100 per cent approval from the owners.About 90 per cent of residents had backed the proposal.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

We have no proposed plans for conservation.\"Pearl Bank Apartments was sold to CapitaLand for $728 million, making it fourth time lucky for the condominium in Outram Park.Owners of the 288 apartments, which range in size from 1,323 sq ft to 3,993 sq ft, stand to receive between $1.8 million and $4.9 million.The owners of the eight commercial units, which vary from 700 sq ft to 5,630 sq ft, could reap between $1.2 million and $6.9 million.Pearl Bank's architect, Mr Tan Cheng Siong, 81, told The Straits Times on the day the deal was announced that it is his \"hope and desire\" that the new owner will conserve the tower.\"The redevelopment formula does not have to comprise only tearing down a structure, especially if the original building has high architectural and heritage value,\" he added.Other architects also called for the condo to be conserved, citing its unique architecture and design, as well as its historical significance.After all, the building was among the pioneers of high-rise, high-density living here.The Urban Redevelopment Authority had said previously that there are merits in Pearl Bank's conservation, given the building set standards for later condo developments on provision of communal amenities such as common areas, clubhouses and shops.However, the owners do not share such sentiments.\"While Pearl Bank Apartments - completed in 1976 - has been a visible landmark in Outram, the ageing building no longer adequately meets the residents' needs, and the costs involved to upkeep the premises are high,\" Ms Seet added.She noted that it costs about $2.5 million to maintain and repair key facilities every two years.As MCST chairman, she has had to deal with numerous complaints from residents over leaking pipes that caused flooding and sparked quarrels among neighbours.There were 84 cases of pipe leaks last year and more than $20,000 was spent on lift maintenance.There are also no barrier-free access features in the building, making it an unfriendly environment for some elderly residents.These were some of the reasons most owners had agreed to a collective sale as early as 2007, said Ms Seet. Owners had attempted three sales - in 2007, 2008 and 2011 - that failed, possibly due to poor market timing.Ms Seet said those failed attempts and the reality of an ageing property in need of repairs likely prompted more than 90 per cent of the owners to back a proposal to conserve the building in 2015.Back then, the owners had wanted to increase its gross floor area and sell this extra space so a developer could build a second apartment block on top of their five-storey carpark. The proceeds would have allowed the owners to retrofit the existing building, but there was not enough backing for the proposal.Unit owner Edward Phang said some owners were not keen on the conservation plan as they would have had to live with the noise and dust from the construction of the new building and the decrepit state of the old one.Mrs Phang bought the unit about a decade ago and has rented it out. It used to fetch $6,000 a month but now it gets only about $2,000.\"There are a lot of repairs needed and I have received six to seven complaints on water seepage. It is everyone's prayers for the en bloc to go through,\" said the retired doctor.Ms Tang said it is difficult to know when residents will have to vacate. Typically, it takes about six months to get various regulatory approvals. Once these have been obtained, the parties have three months to complete the transaction. Then residents have six months to vacate.CapitaLand said it plans to redevelop the site into a high-rise project of around 800 units, with a finish date in early 2023.Mrs Phang noted: \"I like the exterior design of the building and I admire the architect's talent. But the discussion about fighting for heritage is from observers, and we owners have to bear the financial and ill-health costs that come with any construction, which is unsustainable.\"I think the best way out is for the new building to be redeveloped in a way that preserves the essence of the architect's design - its circular structure - and allows new units to have the existing great views.\"Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

These structures are mostly half-way into their 99-year leases.A committee was formed for the collective sale of People's Park Complex on Monday (March 5) at an extraordinary general meeting following \"unanimous consensus\".The Straits Times understands that People's Park Centre has also formed a collective sales committee and will be appointing a real estate firm soon. A committee spokesman said about half of the owners attended the last meeting and 90 per cent of them are in favour for the sale.Meanwhile, Golden Mile Complex, which has already formed its collective sale committee, held its last meeting on Feb 7. The agenda included appointing a valuer for existing units. Marketing agent Edmund Tie and Company is managing its en bloc bid.The neighbouring Golden Mile Tower, designed by architect Goh Hock Guan and his team, is also in the process of forming a collective sale committee and is due to hold an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday (March 8).Of the four, People's Park Complex, Golden Mile Complex and Golden Mile Tower are widely recognised by experts as architecturally and historically significant.The trio were inspired by the Brutalist-architectural movement. The style usually features monumental structures made of off-form concrete without being plastered over, for an appearance of \"strength and solidity\".They also represent a chapter in the island's post-independence architectural history.The three were completed as part of the Government's first Land Sales Programme beginning in 1967 where land parcels were offered for sale with a leasehold of 99 years.Mr Randy Chan, principal of architecture firm Zarch Collaboratives, said: \"We were building mega-structures like these fresh out of independence.\" This slew of en-bloc attempts follows news last month (Feb 13) that the striking horse-shoe shaped Pearl Bank Apartments near Outram Park MRT station, was sold to CapitaLand in a $782 million collective sale. Launched in 1976, it will likely be torn down.Unit owners at People's Park Complex told The Straits Times that they are eager to sell the property \"if the price is right\".The owner of Golden Watch Gold and Jewellery at People's Park Complex, who only wanted to be known as Mr Kea, 75, admitted the structure is special. However, he said: \"Just like an ageing person, an old building will have its issues. As long as the selling price is reasonable, it can move undecided owners.\" Mr Kea has been at the complex since 1988. He said the sentiments among parties present were split down the middle with two camps for and against the en bloc bid.However, second-generation co-owner of Hang Lang Jewellery, Mr Henry Ho, 47, said his family is not interested in selling their shop and the idea of a shinier and new development is not exactly enticing. He noted that business is thriving with heavy traffic for stalls on the ground level which might mean that some owners, like himself, would be reluctant to give up the space.The complex which was completed in 1973, is located next to an exit of the Chinatown MRT station.Mr Ho said: \"We've been here for about 40 years. Business is good enough. Our roots are here - it's where my father started his business. Compared to an Orchard Road Mall, it's not as swanky but there are tourists here and we are surviving.\" The firm behind People's Park Complex was Design Partnership or DP Architects. The team comprised pioneer architects William Lim, Koh Seow Chuan and Tay Kheng Soon.The complex is home to a podium of shops and offices, as well as a 25-storey residential block. Occupying one hectare, it was once the largest shopping complex in Singapore. It also featured the country's first atrium shopping centre for residents and other users in the community to socialise, eat and shop.This design was widely replicated in later local and regional retail developments.Dr Yeo Kang Shua, an architectural historian and conservator, noted that People's Park \"conceptually contributed to the development of architecture, hence its place in history\".The complex is also recognised as one of the first successful urban revitalisation projects in the nation and challenged the concept of single-use zoning.DP Architects also designed Golden Mile Complex. The team comprised Gan Eng Soon, William Lim and Tay Kheng Soon.Mr Alan Lim, who is in his 70s, owns an office space there. He said he is looking to sell his unit. \"It is an en bloc market, everybody is trying to sell. The faster, the better. I am looking to retire so this will be timely.\" The owner of Hong Giap Credit at Golden Mile Complex was of the same view. She declined to give her name but said she bought her provision shop unit in the complex's early days for the price of $50,000.A longtime owner at Golden Mile Tower, who wished to remain anonymous, purchased two units there for $300,000 in 1978. He hopes to sell them for at least $1 million and go into retirement.Owners of ageing properties generally try to sell their units before leases are further shortened. Some said they fear having to pay for additional maintenance, renovation or restoration costs. These structures are usually beset with maintenance issues such as choked toilets, malfunctioning lifts and pest infestations.Dr Yeo said many of these structures do not have enough time to evolve to a \"heritage age\" before they are torn down.Experts have called for a re-look at how these post-independence structures can be conserved appropriately while incentivising developers with more favourable duties.Mr Nicholas Mak, executive director of property consultancy SLP International, said that given the large land parcels in question, the developer who buys it is likely to be a major one with \"deep pockets\". It could also be a a consortium of large-and medium-sized developers. Mr Mak added: \"The easiest way is to bulldoze the buildings and rebuild them.\" Landscape and architectural photographer Darren Soh, said that these circumstances have created a \"perfect storm\" for historical modernist buildings completed in the 1960s and 1970s. \"A combination of factors - an ageing property with a dropping value combined with maintenance issues and an increased appetite from developers, are driving many owners to seriously consider collective sales.\"THE STRAITS TIMES"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

If it succeeds, it will leave just five of Singapore's 18 former HUDC estates still around.The 99-year leasehold site in Dunearn Road has an enviable location: About five minutes' walk to Newton MRT station, near landed estates and Good Class Bungalows and within 1km of popular primary schools such as Anglo Chinese School (Primary), Anglo Chinese School (Junior) and St Joseph's Institution Junior. Situated less than 2km away are Singapore Chinese Girls' Primary School, CHIJ Primary (Toa Payoh) and St Margaret's Primary School.The development comprises 136 apartments and eight commercial units spread over one tower block and seven blocks of four-storey walk-up maisonettes.The site has a land area of 24,074.4 sq m, or 259,134 sq ft, and is zoned Residential with gross plot ratio of 1.4 under the 2014 Master Plan.A redevelopment could potentially yield a maximum 480 units, averaging 70 sq m in size, said its sole marketing agent OrangeTee Advisory.The site is subject to the Pre-Application Feasibility Study (PAFS) on traffic impact. A traffic consultant has been commissioned to undertake the study, said OrangeTee.After including an estimated differential premium of approximately S$180 million to the Government to top up the lease from about 62 years to a fresh 99 years and the intensification of the site to a gross plot ratio of 1.4, the asking price works out to a land rate of S$1,572 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr), which OrangeTee executive director Alex Oh said \"is comparatively attractive in relation to recent land sales nearby\".\"We believe Chancery Court will generate good interest from developers, given its excellent location in District 11, easy access to town via public and private transport and also its close proximity to the few popular and reputable schools,\" he said.The firm's managing director Marcus Oh added: \"To give more certainty to developers, we took the initiative to undertake the PAFS and would expect the advisory on the maximum dwelling units from the authority before the tender closes.

(Photo: Jeremy Long)SINGAPORE: It may be time to re-examine Singapores public housing policy in light of increasing numbers of elderly residents who may need to monetise their housing to provide for retirement.News last year that land at Lorong 3 Geylang where 191 private terrace houses sit would be returned to the state when the lease expires in 2020, has also provoked further discussion about HDBs 99-year leases and what it means for the public, who have been encouraged to view property as an appreciating asset.DO WE HAVE ENOUGH FOR RETIREMENT?In 2016, the average CPF balance of persons aged 50 to 55 was S$137,000, enough for about slightly over S$1,000 in monthly income in CPF LIFE if one were to invest in the annuity now.In a reply to questions in Parliament in 2014, then Minister for Manpower Tan Chuan-Jin said that only half of CPF members met their minimum sum pledge at age 55, inclusive of their property pledge.Compared with the usual advice from financial planning experts that a persons retirement income should be about 60 to 70 per cent of ones pre-retirement income, it seems many may not be able to depend on CPF for retirement adequacy.The number of persons aged 65 and above has increased from 8.5 per cent in 2007 to 13 per cent in 2017. This proportion could double again by 2030.The National Survey of Senior Citizens last released in 2011 found that most senior citizens main source of income was from their children, something which may not be sustainable for many in the future, with increasing numbers of singles and childless couples.MONETISING OUR HOMEHousing can be viewed as a kind of retirement saving, particularly in Singapore, where home ownership rates are among the highest in the world. Here, homes are financed very often primarily from CPF withdrawals and seen as assets with value to be unlocked when one gets older.One study by the OECD concluded that ones CPF savings could provide for somewhere between 13 per cent to 82 per cent of ones pre-retirement income, depending on how much was withdrawn from CPF to pay for housing.At the end of 2017, net withdrawals from the CPF for housing amounted to S$210 billion.In 2003, based on the recommendations of the Economic Review Committee, the Government implemented a CPF withdrawal limit for property preventing people from withdrawing more than 120 per cent of the valuation of their property, including interest costs. This is likely to aid new entrants to the workforce in saving for their retirement better.But this still leaves many people, including todays pre-retirees in a potentially tenuous situation when it comes to unlocking the value of their old homes for retirement income.This is one reason why the Government has promoted schemes over the years, such as reverse mortgages and the Lease Buyback Scheme, to help home owners monetise their houses.But these schemes are not popular. Reverse mortgages were introduced in 1997 but failed to take off, with the last provider discontinuing the product in 2009. The Lease Buyback Scheme run by the HDB has a poor take-up with only about 2,500 since it was launched in 2009.One reason might be that the Lease Buyback Scheme offers relatively little value and does not give guarantees as to what happens should the family outlive the shorter lease, even though HDB says applicants will not be left homeless.With the number of elderly possibly doubling by 2030, any attempt at downgrading may encounter supply challenges as large numbers of people try to do so at once.THE HDB 99-YEAR LEASEHOLD ISSUEIn March 2017, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong sounded a note of caution regarding the phenomenon of home buyers paying high prices for old HDB flats in the hope of benefiting from a Selective En Bloc Redevelopment scheme (SERS). There are no guarantees and HDB flats will be returned to the state at the end of their leases, he said.The practical issue is understandable the Government would not be able to afford to rescue everyone.This has resulted in some public unease over the issue. At the moment, these voices are muted, probably due to the fact that there is no serious HDB test case yet.Dr Ng Kok Hoe from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public policy has highlighted in a commentary for Channel NewsAsia that we should re-examine our housing policy design and explore other housing options including renting, with a view to de-emphasise the view of housing as social security.THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF A HDB FLATYou cannot buy a HDB as a second property for investment purposes, and only Singaporeans and Permanent Residents can own one. A purchaser of a HDB flat must ensure that any private property owned must be sold within a certain period.In contrast, with private property, you can freely en-bloc, buy a lease top-up, sublet or sell to an investor.All these restrictions mean that HDB flats will be valued less than an equivalent leasehold private property.A HDB flat also does not really sell at potential economic value.A 4-room HDB flat in Toa Payoh with 57 years of lease left sells for about S$360,000. A flat in the same block can be sublet for S$2,200 a month (a 7 per cent gross yield). Even if you sublet the flat for only 75 per cent of the time, in 57 years, this is S$1.1 million in cashflow.IS THERE ANOTHER WAY OUT?What can we do to tackle this conundrum? One idea is to privatise older HDB flats, while we still have time to roll it out before problems arise. We have a precedent.The HUDC programme was a programme started in the 1970s with the aim of catering to sandwiched middle-class professionals who did not qualify for low-cost HDB housing. By the 1990s, as the HDB programme gained momentum and catered to most classes of buyers with offerings such as executive flats, demand for the HUDC programme declined.In 1995, HUDC estates were allowed to privatise provided a clear majority of owners voted for it and paid HDB a fee, inclusive of buying over common areas.One by one, HUDC estates went private. Many went en bloc, with the developer picking up the tab for a lease top-up. Others simply topped up their leases.In a similar way, we can do so for older HDB estates. Privatising HDB flats frees the way for owners of older HDB flats to maximise their ownership and monetise their houses as private property owners.In the HUDC case, the process of privatisation across various HUDC properties was drawn out over decades. HDB privatisation can be similarly managed to ease the transition and avoid supply shocks, concurrent with HDB managing the supply of new flats.The HDB programme has succeeded beyond its wildest imagining. It has done its job in providing decent housing for the vast majority of Singaporeans since the countrys independence.Maybe it is time for the HDB to step back and evolve. Allow people to have more choice, less reliance on Government when it comes to housing, and have the HDB refocus its social mission.Tan Jin Meng is pursuing a full-time post graduate degree at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and is currently engaged in research on long-term care financing for a local non-government organisation interested in eldercare matters."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

One thing for certain is that real estate prices do not always have a direct relationship with rentals in Singapore. For instance, asproperty prices recover, the private rental market continues to remain weak. In this article, we seek to explore the relationship between property prices and rentals, and the reasons behind the decline in rental yield in recent years. Private properties prices vs rentals Following the URA property price indexs (PPI) reversal from its downtrend in 3Q2017, private home prices has continued to gain momentum into 1Q2018. On the other hand, the private residential rental index fell 0.9% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in 4Q2017, after a period of stabilisation in the previous quarter. Source: URA, EdgeProp.sg One possible reason for this is because unlike cities like Hong Kong widely regarded as another one of Asias most important financial centres Singapores rental market is very much driven by foreign demand, given that over80% of Singaporeansown a HDB flat. In comparison, Hong Kongs rental market is increasingly being driven by a mix of local and PRC tenants, often senior staff from funds and brokerages. Locals are being driven into the leasing market by sky high prices and the limited availability of larger newly completed apartments on Hong Kong Island, Savills Hong Kong says in its recent Residential Leasing Briefingreport. As of 2017, it is estimated that home ownership amongst Hong Kongs population of 7.347 million stands only at about 49.20%, according to data by Trading Economics. Source: Data.gov.hk, EdgeProp.sg Understanding the dynamics of the rental market landscape helps provide insight into connections between demand and supply, where the hot commodities are, and where there could be room for negotiation. Why have rentals been falling? 1) Falling foreign demand We already know that foreign demand is an important driver in Singapores rental market. In previous years, the amalgam of slowing economic growth, weakening oil and gas sector, and the tightening of foreign worker policy have created a dampening effect on rentals. Figures from theMinistry of Manpower (MOM)showed that the total foreign workforce in Singapore fell from 1.393 million in December 2016 to 1.368 million in December 2017. Further, the qualifying salary for foreigners to be hired on Employment Pass (EP) was raised from $3,300 to $3,600 from January 2017. An EP allows foreign professionals, managers and executives to work in Singapore. Incidentally, the number of foreign professionals on EP fell from 192,300 in December 2016 to 187,700 in December 2017. 2) Diversification of expatriate roles: Its not just the tightening inflow of foreigners, many expatriates in Singapore today have also diversified beyond management roles and are no longer receiving lucrative packages, says Desmond Sim, CBREs head of Singapore and Southeast Asia research. Sim explains: Expatriate demand has been core to the rental market here, and this demand has traditionally encircled high-end properties within prime districts 9, 10 and 11. But times have changed. Today, many expats no longer receive full expat packages, which previously included cars and tuition fees for their children. Also, expats in executive positions are becoming increasingly common. Instead of upscale neighbourhoods like Ardmore, expats in these positions would typically opt to rent in the suburbs, where it is more affordable, he shares. Based on our analysis, average monthly rentals and average rental psf for studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units of non-landed residential properties in prime districts 9, 10, 11 and Downtown Core have been falling year-on-year from 1Q2012 to 1Q2018. Source: URA, EdgeProp In addition, more expats are moving into the HDB segment. However, the impact on the overall HDB market will not be significant, as condos remain the first pickings of expatriates, especially those from Anglo-Saxon countries, says CBREs Sim. Will they eventually go back up? There are signs pointing to a possible recovery in the residential rental market and this is primarily due to a decline in vacancy rate, which fell from 8.4% in 2016 to 7.8% in 2017. This improvement was attributed to a diminished supply of newly completed private residential units in 2017. According to URA figures, there were 20,803 completed units in 2016 and 16,685 completed units in 2017. In comparison, a total of 10,634 private residential units are expected to complete in 2018. The lower number of completions may further improve rental vacancy rates. However, Christine Li, director and head of research at Cushman & Wakefield notes that non-landed rents in the Outside Central Region (OCR) could stillcome under pressure, given that 50% of incoming supply is expected to be in OCR from 2018 to 2022. The sizzling hot collective sales market is another factor that could possibly create an uplifting effect on rentals. Due to the flurry of en bloc activities since 2017, displaced owners of successful en bloc sales may require more time to look for a replacement home or wait at least 30 months before they can apply for a built-to-order (BTO) HDB flat. While this is expected to improve occupancy rates for private properties in the short-term, CRBEs Sim says it also depends on whether demand from the displacement will hold up once these en bloc beneficiaries secure their replacement units. Further, foreign employment core to Singapores private residential rental market will likely remain subdued in the near future as rules on foreign employment continue to be tightened. Most recently, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announced that the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) which requires employers to advertise job vacancies for 14 days on the national Jobs Bank before submitting employment pass (EP) applications will be extended to firms with 10 or more employees and for jobs paying under $15,000 a month from July 1. Currently, it applies only to firms with at least 26 workers and for jobs paying under $12,000 a month. The minimum qualifying salary to apply for an S-pass for foreign mid-skilled level staff will also be raised from $2,200 to $2,400 in phases starting from 1 Jan 2019. With these new measures, and with more companies prioritising the hiring of local workers over foreigners, it is expected that rental demand could be affected, Savills Singapore says in its Residential Leasing Briefing 4Q2017 report. Does it still pay to invest in rental property? There is no hard or fast answer for this. However, having a good understanding of what does and what doesnt make for a money-making rental property is a good place to start. In a previous study, we looked at apartments and condominiums across Singapore that commanded gross rental yields of 4% and above and found that they have thesethree characteristics in common: proximity to the city centre, proximity to MRT stations and close distance to schools. However, while rental yield is one of the most quoted indicators used when assessing a propertys investment potential, it is only one part of the investment of returns equation. When considering real estate investment, it is equally important that you understand its capital growth potential. The general rule of thumb is, the lower the purchase price, the higher the potential for upside, and the higher the likelihood that rental yields will be favourable, such as these older freehold apartmentsat below $1,000 psf."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It has total net lettable area of about 50,000 square feet, and a 99-year lease which will expire in 2046.The acquisition is in line with the Reit's strategy of acquiring retail properties that would complement its assets, namely the Paragon and The Clementi Mall, said SPH Reit Management.The property is currently held by Pulau Properties, which is in turn owned by the Lee Foundation and members of the Lee family.An independent valuation of the property by Edmund Tie & Company (SEA) Pte Ltd, which was appointed by the trustee, had reached a figure of S$62.9 million using the discounted cash flow approach and capitalisation approach.The purchase consideration was arrived at on a willing-buyer willing-seller basis, said SPH Reit manager. This will be paid out in two tranches.Five per cent of the purchase consideration will be paid to the vendor's solicitors on the execution of the sale and purchase agreement. The balance is to be paid to the vendor on completion of the acquisition which is expected to take place on June 28 this year.Reit manager CEO Susan Leng said The Rail Mall will provide SPH Reit the opportunity to further strengthen its food and beverage offerings.\"We believe a well-curated mix of F&B concepts complemented with services will serve the immediate established Hillview and Upper Bukit Timah community well,\" she said in a statement. \"In addition, SPH Reit will intensify community programmes leveraging on the Rail Corridor to attract a wider catchment, as it is well served by the public transport network and accessibility to expressways.\"The Rail Mall came into being when Lee Rubber subsidiary Singapore Engineers in 1994 gave the 43 one-storey units a S$5 million facelift to turn it into a neighbourhood centre. The mall went through another revamp in 2008 as its management tried to position it as a food and lifestyle hub for the west. Its current tenants include Cold Storage, F&B outlets such as Toast Box and a few tuition agencies.Units in SPH Reit closed unchanged at 99 cents on Monday, before the announcement."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

What's fuelling interest in these prime conservation properties?FollowA NICHE market often bypassed by real estate investors due to its specific guidelines on use, the prime conservation shophouse market in Singapore's city core has been buzzing with activity of late. Shophouses in the CBD and Chinatown (the old postal districts 1 and 2) have seen increased transaction activity, along with price appreciation since the second half of last year. These properties, costing anywhere from S$7 million to S$25 million each and housing tenants ranging from hipster bars to au courant restaurants to boutique offices, are sometimes compared to Good Class Bungalows (GCBs) for their scarcity value.But there is a key difference between the two property segments which also explains their appeal: whereas foreigners are not allowed to buy landed homes in GCB Areas, they may acquire shophouses on sites that are fully zoned commercial. This gives them ownership of the land title, and therein lies the attraction of such shophouses to foreigners.One investor also tells BT he prefers to park his money in commercial shophouses instead of residential properties, as \"yields are higher; moreover there is no additional buyer's stamp duty, it is easier to get financing and no stamp duty payable on exiting the investment\".The heightened activity this year is partly led by supply.A substantial portfolio of shophouses in the Boat Quay/Circular Road and New Bridge Road areas was put on the market by the family of the late Teochew businessman and philanthropist Lee Wee Nam.The nine shophouses and one commercial building were snapped up in March for S$82.5 million by homegrown property investment group 8M Real Estate.Positive sentiment from the overall improvement in the property market and more sanguine economic outlook has also spilled over to the shophouse segment; investors are being drawn by prospects of further price appreciation.\"Five years ago, freehold/999-year leasehold shophouses in Districts 1 & 2 (D1 and D2) were typically trading between S$2,000 per square foot (psf) and S$2,500 psf on built-up area. This has since increased to about S$2,750-S$3,250 psf in late 2017 till now,\" says Clemence Lee, associate director of capital markets at JLL.D1 includes areas such as Boat Quay, Club Street, Amoy Street, Telok Ayer Street, Temple Street and Pagoda Street. D2 includes Bukit Pasoh Road, Jiak Chuan Road, New Bridge Road, Keong Saik Road and Teck Lim Road.Along Tanjong Pagar Road, in District 2, the steady price rise in the past couple of years is apparent in three transactions along the same stretch: from S$2,166 psf for Nos 15-23 in 2016, to S$2,400 psf for Nos 29 and 31 in 2017, to S$2,466 psf for Nos 25 and 27 earlier this year. This translates to a total price gain of nearly 14 per cent over two years. All the shophouses in these three deals are on land with the same tenure: 99 years starting December 1994.The big owners of conservation shophouses in Districts 1 and 2 include homegrown outfits 8M and Clifton Partners, SilkRoad Property Partners, Hongkonger Tony Chen of Arcc Holdings, Spanish tycoon Ricardo Peralta and Stanley Quek of Region Development.8M, whose shareholders comprise Ashish Manchharam and institutional investors, owns more than 40 shophouses in Districts 1 and 2 worth about S$500 million - bolstered by its recent S$82.5 million acquisition. Set up in 2014, 8M has so far not sold any of its properties.Mr Chen, who owns 60 conservation shophouses in Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little India, is a long-term investor. \"We are passionate about heritage shophouses. Owning a conservation shophouse is like owning a piece of unique artwork sitting on land. It has to be preserved,\" says the Singapore PR who has been living here for 30 years.Clifton Partners and its affiliates currently own 14 shophouses in D1 and D2 - with a combined value of about S$250 million.\"We look for conservation units with potential for value adding and restoring to their original condition, boosting rentability in the process,\" says Zain Fancy, who owns Clifton. He was formerly Morgan Stanley's Asia real estate investment head.In the past five years, the group and its affiliates have sold 15 conservation shophouses for close to S$160 million.\"We more than doubled our investment. The lowest pretax internal rate of return for a monetised shophouse was in the low-double digits per annum,\" says Mr Fancy.Sammi Lim, director, capital markets, CBRE, says: \"The investment outlook for conservation shophouses remains healthy. URA's conservation framework and guidelines will ensure that the capital values of these assets hold steady.\"Their scarcity and sound real estate fundamentals have bolstered investors' confidence that these heritage assets are prized and worthy of long-term investment.\"Yet, agents say yields for commercial shophouses in the CBD have fallen over the past year as rental increases have not kept pace with price gains. For freehold/999-year leasehold shophouses, gross yields have eased from 3 per cent a year ago to 2.5-2.7 per cent. For 99-year leasehold shophouses, yields have slipped from 3.5 per cent to 3 per cent, said Mr Lee of JLL.Rents for food and beverage (F&B) outlets on the ground floor of shophouses in D1 and D2 have remained flat in the past year, while rents for office space (typically on the upper levels of shophouses) have inched up a few per cent.Prime street frontagePerhaps for this very reason, shophouses continue to attract tenants.According to JLL's data, it costs about 20-30 per cent less to rent ground-floor F&B space in shophouses in D1 and D2 compared with leasing the same amount of space in a nearby mall or mixed-development. \"This is partly because there is no gross turnover (GTO) rent component in shophouse leases; tenants pay only a fixed rental,\" says the property consulting group's national director of retail Gary Nonis.An F&B tenant can expect to pay S$10,000 to S$48,000 in monthly rental for ground-floor shophouse space of 800 to 4,000 sq ft (or about S$12 psf on average) in D1 and D2 - against S$14,000 to S$65,000 (including the GTO rent component) in a mixed development in the financial district.The prime street frontage and flexibility of operating hours also draw tenants, says Knight Frank executive director Mary Sai. \"There is also more flexibility on the way you do your layout and how you dress up the shop - unlike in a shopping mall. For a shophouse, although you have to follow URA guidelines, your facade can be quite different; you don't need to be consistent with your neighbour.\"Mr Nonis points to other reasons why it makes good sense for restaurants to be in shophouses: \"While F&B operators in a mixed development often rely on a captive crowd (office workers in the building) and patrons from nearby properties, the downside of operating within a mixed development, specifically within the CBD, is that it is usually a weekday trade.\"On the other hand, shophouse clusters attract not only those who work in nearby developments but also tourists.\"Mr Lee says that malls draw the usual F&B tenants and tend to be more homogenised; conservation shophouses make for more experiential, destination lifestyle offerings in a heritage setting. \"The younger generation likes the idea of finding a hidden restaurant or bar.\"Tenants looking for non-conventional office space - at rentals much lower than prime office buildings - have also flocked to shophouses. Office tenants leasing space on the upper floors of shophouses in the financial district can expect to pay about S$5-8 psf a month for say 1,000 to 5,000 sq ft, depending on the quality of the shophouse and its location - lower than the S$10-12 psf for similar-sized space in prime Grade A office buildings, says JLL's regional director of markets Tahlil Khan.\"Shophouses tend to draw occupiers that do not require the conventional corporate image of being in an office tower - including media and PR/advertising firms, smaller law firms, tech companies and business incubators,\" he added.Co-working space operator The Working Capitol is one that has taken to shophouses in a big way. It signed master leases of longer than the standard three years at 1 and 3 Keong Saik Road and for the second-level space at the neighbouring 120 and 122 Neil Road, giving it a total gross floor (GFA) area of 40,000 sq ft - enough to pack in 400 seats (from hotdesking to dedicated offices) catering to solo-preneurs to MNCs, an events venue that can seat 200 people, a cafe and four restaurants.\"Over here, our operation is so synonymous with the neighbourhood; the shophouse architecture and street landscape are such an integral part of our identity. It evokes a more emotional response compared with a glass office tower in the CBD,\" says The Working Capitol chief executive and co-founder, Benjamin Gattie.The group has also leased all of 89 Neil Road which will give it an additional 25,000 sq ft GFA (for a further 300 seats) plus a 7,000 sq ft roof terrace; and has begun to operate in this space in phases since last month.Apart from interesting restaurants and trendy offices, a row of adjoining shophouses also makes for a unique boutique hotel experience. Garcha Hotels acquired 28 conservation shophouses in three locations in 2012-2013 for a total S$148 million and spent a significant sum restoring them into three luxury hotels. Two are already operating: The Vagabond Club - a Tribute Portfolio Hotel in Syed Alwi Road and Six Senses Duxton. The third, Six Senses Maxwell, is slated to open later this year.\"For all three properties, on average, it has taken us about a year longer than we originally anticipated to restore the properties; they were full-gut renovations,\" says Satinder Garcha, chairman and CEO of the group.\"The biggest challenge is working within the conservation guidelines. The costs are generally higher; it is a lot more expensive to restore per square foot within a shophouse than to just build a new building - because there is a lot more complexity, and other than that, in the case of two of our three properties, putting it to a use that it was not originally built for. It is like working with a jigsaw puzzle. But then it is very rewarding to see it turn out actually.\" Mr Garcha notes that conservation shophouse prices in Singapore have gone up significantly in the past five to seven years because of the scarcity value. \"And because of the heritage value, the appeal of these properties continually grows upon people. And I don't see that changing. I still see conservation shophouses as good investments for the long term.\"There are about 6,760 shophouses in Singapore gazetted for conservation. They make up the bulk of the nearly 7,200 buildings gazetted for conservation.\"This is no mean feat for a small island and land-scarce city-state with competing land use needs. It is a testament to the importance we place on our built heritage and a holistic urban planning approach,\" says Teh Lai Yip, senior director, conservation, at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). She was part of the team led by by Koh-Lim Wen Gin in the 1980s that championed the conservation cause. Mrs Koh-Lim retired as chief planner and deputy chief executive of URA in December 2008.\"Many other cities envy us,\" says Mrs Koh-Lim. \"We are so small, with limited land and yet we can do conservation in a comprehensive way and there's enough critical mass and presence.\"Nearly half or 3,320 of the 6,760 conservation shophouses are in the Historic Districts of Boat Quay, Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little India. \"Together as a district or as a street, I think these shophouses enhance the physical environment, the streetscape. Their presence enhances the built environment.\" For instance, the low-rise shophouses along Boat Quay provide 'urban windows' for the high-rise office buildings behind.\"So for the city as a whole, there is all this porosity, so the built environment as a whole is enhanced. Imagine if all the areas where you see conservation shophouses today were high-rise; there would be no breathing space,\" says Mrs Koh-Lim.Architectural historian and anthropologist Julian Davison says: \"The shophouse is very much a cultural signifier for Singapore. \"A large part of Singapore's identity is wrapped up in its history as a port city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the ubiquitous shophouse defined the urban fabric of the city in that period and continued to do so until the early days of independence.\"Post-independence, despite the pressures for redeveloping the city, the authorities managed to safeguard some precincts of shophouses in the Historic Districts.Says Knight Frank's Ms Sai: \"Shophouses remind us of our historic background, the immigrants who came here and wanted to have their accommodation and business in the same premises.\" Ms Sai herself grew up in a shophouse.Her family used to run a coffeeshop downstairs and lived upstairs. That property was part of a row of shophouses right at the end of Tanjong Pagar and Anson Road - which was later torn down to make way for the container port.\"It was fun growing up in a shophouse. Amenities were just a few doors away. You had a barber shop, a prawn noodle shop, provision shop; there was even a wet market selling pork and vegetables within a shophouse. If you lived next to a pet shop selling birds, you would hear parrots repeating orders being shouted at the nearby coffeeshop in Hainanese.\"Simon Monteiro, associate director of heritage buildings at Savills Singapore, who has been selling shophouses for nearly 25 years, says: \"A conserved shophouse is like a time capsule. Each shophouse that has been gazetted for conservation brings you back to that era, what the architecture was at that time, the story of how our forefathers lived...\"Some feel however, that certain areas have lost some of that hallowed charm.Mr Monteiro suggests it would be timely for the authorities to take a closer look at the tenant mix in certain conservation areas. \"Today, there are too many Korean restaurants in Tanjong Pagar; it's like Little Korea.\"\"Perhaps, URA should adopt some sort of quotas on tenant mix in the Historic Districts to ensure they reflect the heritage of the place. I don't think we want tourists to label our heritage area as Korean Town.\"URA should research to create a balanced tenant mix, and educate owners that the objective of conservation is to show to the world our roots through these shophouses.\"In a similar vein, Mrs Koh-Lim says: \"For each of these Historic Districts, URA needs to play a more pro-active role in the place management; it needs to review the land-use control instead of just stating a broad category like 'commercial'.\"Perhaps it is timely to review and ask ourselves whether we should narrow down the kinds of trades to allow in these premises. After so many decades now, we should review and retake a new position, if you ask me. If you have the will, this can be done.\"You can have a five-year plan; it may not be feasible to implement things immediately, but gradually, you could encourage the owners and guide them back to retain some of the charm and character of the place.\"But it cannot be back to the 'good old days' for sure because some trades have vanished. Only the viable traditional trades that are still in demand - like medical halls, shops selling herbs, dried goods, traditional confectionery shops, etc - can afford the rentals.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

But he said it is likely that they will reach the required 80 per cent consent since 83 per cent of owners have already paid up fees meant for expenses such as lawyers and property valuation.The development, which was completed in 1994, has an allowable gross floor area (GFA) of 723,627 sq ft and a plot ratio of 1.4, which translates to S$1,078 per square foot per plot ratio.No development charges are expected to be payable based on the current 1.4 plot ratio payable but there will be a lease top up premium of an estimated S$60 million.

This is a sweet victory for property giant Far East Organization, which has fallen behind other Singapore developers in the ongoing residential land-buying spree.The Far East-led consortium's winning bid was the highest of the five shortlisted tenderers' for the dual-envelope (concept and price) tender, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said. The tender, which closed on March 20, drew 15 bids from 10 consortiums. The Far East-led tie-up placed the most bids, three, each with a different concept proposal.The Holland Road site, which sits near Holland Village's F&B outlets, can have a maximum gross floor area (GFA) of 59,715 sq m (642,766 sq ft). Up to 13,500 sq m of that can be used for retail. At least 60 per cent of the total GFA should be for residential use, and the remaining 40 per cent, for commercial use.Although the winning consortium could have used the full 60 per cent for apartments for sale, it chose to split this GFA into 400-plus apartments for sale, and 100-plus serviced apartments. Mr Tan said: \"We are in this for the long term. We have confidence there will be good demand for serviced residences in this location, so we did not maximise the apartments for sale in this project.\"Far East's proposed scheme will have two towers of 33 storeys and 25 storeys housing the 400-plus apartments for sale, a 10-storey serviced apartment tower and five levels of office space above the retail/F&B space. There will also be dual office/residential units as a component of the office space.Mr Tan said: \"Our future development will build upon the existing identity of Holland Village, and we will ensure that it remains sensitive to the existing community while enriching the social fabric.\"Holland Village is a much-loved precinct with a distinctive character, heritage, and history. Like many of our fellow Singaporeans, we too cherish the precinct's unique atmosphere and quaint charm, as well as its valuable store of social memories.\"URA said that overall, the concept proposal by the winning bidder is \"compelling in its design concept and planning of the public realm\".Among other things, the URA noted that the public spaces form a series of unique street experiences that would extend the street experience of the existing Holland Village. The future development features a series of ground-floor public spaces, including a \"Pocket Park\", which opens into Lorong Mambong in Holland Village.There will also be a \"Commons Square\" for holding events such as weekend markets and outdoor performances; there will also be a \"Communal Green\", a courtyard flanked by shops leading to a water court and a terraced water feature.The URA also said that the building form and massing of the scheme will allow the development to sit comfortably with the existing Holland Village.Furthermore, a series of connected open walkways will be built to link these public spaces to the surrounding areas.The URA said: \"Through street-paving design, the existing Lorong Liput and Lorong Mambong will be extended into the future development, thus creating a consistent and distinctive streetscape for the larger Holland Village precinct.\"This is the first acquisition of over S$1 billion by Far East in seven years. In 2011, it partnered Frasers Centrepoint (now Frasers Property) and Sekisui House to clinch a site in Punggol for S$1.02 billion. The trio have since developed it into the Watertown mixed-development project.The other four shortlisted bids for the tender came from:-Except for the CapitaLand-HPL tie-up, the other three consortiums had also placed two bids each.All bidders were required to submit their concept proposals and tender prices in two separate envelopes. Only the envelopes containing concept proposals were opened on the day the tender closed. The URA released on the same evening the names of the bidders but not the bid prices.A Concept Evaluation Committee (CEC) first evaluated the concept proposals against the evaluation criteria. Following the close of the tender, all tenderers were given the opportunity to present their proposals to the CEC, which was able to seek the necessary clarifications.The CEC concluded that the five concept proposals submitted by the above five tenderers had substantially satisfied the evaluation criteria, and shortlisted them for the second stage of the tender evaluation.At the second stage, the price envelopes of the five tenderers were opened and the site awarded to the tenderer with the highest bid."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

ESR-Reit will acquire all of VIT's stapled securities, and in return issue new ESR-Reit units to the stapled security holders, providing VIT with an implied equity value of about $936.7 million.Based on the issue price of $0.54 per new ESR-Reit unit, VIT stapled securityholders can expect to receive $9.60 in cash, and 160 new ESR-Reit units for every 100 stapled securities held. ESR Funds Management will be the manager of the enlarged trust, which will benefit from a larger market cap of $1.7 billion, said the managers. Subject to regulatory approvals, certain key management executives and board members of Viva Industrial Trust Management will also be joining the ESR-Reit Manager. The total acquisition cost of approximately $1.5 billion to be paid by ESR-Reit includes a scheme consideration of $936.7 million, and a refinancing of VIT's existing debt of $525 million among other expenses. The scheme consideration will be satisfied 10 per cent in cash, and 90 per cent through the issuance of new ESR-Reit units, implying a gross exchange ratio of 1.778 times, the managers said. They added that the transaction is deemed to be value-accretive for VIT stapled securityholders, and distribution per unit (DPU)-accretive for ESR-Reit unitholders on a historical pro-forma basis.According to the manager of ESR-Reit, other key benefits of the merger include: the creation of a sizeable and liquid industrial S-Reit, enlarged portfolio quality and scalability with the addition of properties, as well as the trust's growth being supported by a committed developer-sponsor, ESR - a pan-Asian logistics real estate platform. Said executive director and CEO of the ESR-Reit manager, Adrian Chui: \"Size does matter for Reits. This merger will be a milestone transaction that will create a portfolio that is stronger, more resilient and better-diversified. Leveraging our respective capabilities in operational and capital management, we will be in a strong position to deliver value to unitholders.\"The merger is expected to be completed by the third quarter this year. In order for the deal to go through, ESR-Reit will have to gain approval for the merger via an ordinary resolution with a majority vote, as well as an extraordinary resolution with 75 per cent or more of the votes casting in favour of issuing the new ESR-Reit units. A \"whitewash waiver\" is also needed to waive the requirement for the Tong Group to make a mandatory general offer for ESR-Reit as a result of an increase in its unitholdings post-merger. On VIT's end, approval for the scheme is required from more than 50 per cent in number of stapled securityholders voting either in person or by proxy at the scheme meeting representing not less than 75 per cent in the value of stapled securities among other conditions. Upon the scheme becoming effective, VIT will be wholly-owned by ESR-Reit, and be delisted from the Singapore bourse, subject to approval from the Singapore Exchange.VIT traded unchanged at $0.89 per unit on Thursday, while ESR-Reit closed down 1.87 per cent at $0.525 per unit.

If it goes through, it will happen by way of a trust scheme of arrangement, under which ESR-Reit's manager will become the manager of the enlarged trust; VIT will be de-listed from the Singapore bourse.The move raises questions of whether private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which owns e-Shang Redwood (ESR), will continue to build up its presence in S-Reits, with Reit investor Tong Jinquan as a potentially ally. The Chinese property tycoon is a substantial unitholder in both Reits that are planning to merge. If the merger is successful, he would own 33.8 per cent of the enlarged trust structure.But even if it doesn't come to pass, other small industrial Reits could look to it as a case study for their own potential mergers. The acquisition cost of S$1.5 billion comprises a scheme consideration of S$936.7 million and a refinancing of VIT's existing debt of S$525 million among other expenses.The scheme consideration payable to VIT Stapled Securityholders is S$0.96 per Stapled Security on an ex-distributions basis. Based on the issue price of S$0.54 per new ESR-Reit unit, VIT Stapled Securityholders can expect to receive S$9.60 in cash and 160 new ESR-Reit Units for every 100 Stapled Securities held.A CGS-CIMB note, describing the consolidation of managers as \"a critical bottleneck for Reit mergers\", said it was overcome in this case. ESR-Reit's manager will pay S$62 million to acquire VIT's manager.\"Such arrangements could pave the way for future Reit M&As,\" said CGS-CIMB.CGS-CIMB analyst Yeo Zhi Bin told The Business Times: \"A consolidation theme may be more prevalent among industrial Reits than in other asset classes because of the number of industrial Reits that are independent and sub-scale.... (and may want to) reap the benefits of scale.\"A DBS equity research note dated Jan 30 this year - when ESR-Reit first announced merger talks with VIT - said other mid-cap industrial Reits will be accorded an \"acquisition premium\" post M&A. It said: \"Cache Logistics Trust and Soilbuild Reit are interesting targets, given similar sponsor and shareholder structures respectively.\"However, the timing and certainty of any deal is tough to identify.\" Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners, said the proposed merger announcement adds to an \"alive-and-kicking\" Reits market, which has had a recent flurry of activity.This month, Manulife US Reit announced a preferential offering of 22 new units for every 100 held at US$0.865 per unit to raise some US$197.2 million; CapitaLand Commercial Trust (CCT) announced it was buying a majority stake in a prime Frankfurt property for 342.7 million euros (S$542.5 million), partially funded through an equity placement of at least S$212 million.Managers of ESR-Reit and VIT told reporters on Friday that the enlarged trust will see market capitalisation grow to S$1.7 billion, and free float will increase to S$977 million, which they said would result in higher trading liquidity, a large investor base and potential index inclusion.Adrian Chui, chief executive officer and executive director of the ESR-Reit manager, said: \"This merger is not being done just because we want size. We think our portfolios are complementary... and when we become bigger, it becomes better for us in terms of our market position.\"In particular, VIT's focus on industrial parks with assets such as Viva Business Park, and its track record in asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) would complement ESR-Reit's focus on high-spec and general industrial spaces, he said. When asked about other possible M&A partners down the road, he said: \"We're always open to that but... we dont want to get ahead of ourselves.\" Derek Tan of DBS Equity Research pointed out the possibility of the enlarged trust having a positive re-rating \"closer to the large caps\", as well as the possibility of repricing its debt, which could shave off some of the interest costs and lead to better distribution per unit (DPU) for investors.In a research note, CLSA called this a win-win for unit holders. It said: \"We see investment merits from both sides, with VIT shareholders exiting above book valuation and gaining access to sponsor and pipeline. \"On the other hand, ESR Reit shareholders can gain access to business parks and hi-specs buildings with better demand supply outlook and potential yield compression that comes with having a bigger portfolio.\" But CLSA also flagged some risks: \"VIT's FY17 distributable income includes income support that is expected to fall off over the next two years and have shorter land tenures.\"Amendment note: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story incorrectly said that the proposed merger would create a combined S$33 billion in assets.

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a sector that's relatively easy to understand, but there are still some factors to watch out forIN a complex and fast-moving financial world, it's comforting to know that some sectors remain relatively easy to understand. A case in point is property development. The property developer acquires land, an architect then designs the building and obtains planning approval before passing the baton to the construction team.At this stage, the developer could choose to undertake marketing and sales before construction is complete or wait until the last brick falls into place. Either way, you can then calculate the gross development value (GDV) of a project or profit from the project, of which the sum of GDV, excluding the developer's liabilities, will yield the value of the development.Lumpy revenue generationSo far, so simple. There are, however, a few variations that you should note. We shall begin with the lumpy nature of revenue generation.It can take years to complete a project, and if the developer has only one development, then the profit-and-loss account will not record any revenue during the planning and construction phase - something that can stretch for many financial reporting quarters. Upon completion, and the subsequent sale of residential or commercial units, revenue will spike before declining when all units are sold. Investors and analysts are somewhat uneasy with this \"erratic\" performance.That said, revenue volatility is not a pertinent issue for big developers, as they usually have multiple projects running with different completion dates.For companies that do not fall into this category, the need to smooth out their income stream is far stronger. The following steps may stabilise the variations:Develop the land in phases. The first tranche is completed and sold, often at a lower entry price to generate interest in the project. When word gets out that the initial stage was well-received, work will start on phase two. By adopting this approach, the smaller developer's revenue will appear more fluid.For developers that lack the financial resources to take on multiple enterprises, there is the option of running numerous projects through joint ventures. The landowner supplies the land while the property developer does the rest, which evens out revenue reporting numbers and reduces risk exposure to a project.Generate money from property investment. Developers may hold on to units for rental purposes, forming a revenue base and providing earnings stability. Alternatively, they may spin off the property investment portfolio to a Reit, where dividends are declared on a quarterly or half-yearly basis.Is it also important to point out that any assessment of a property developer should consider the geographical distribution of its revenue sources - diversification reduces the risks associated with revenue concentration. Nevertheless, embodied in the points above are the all-important reputation and track record of the company.Different demand factors for developersFor residential property developers, key statistics include demographics: population, age, and net migration, as well as movement from the countryside to the city. Changes in income statistics should also be observed. Other areas to investigate include issues relating to single-occupancy city-centre apartments and suburban family houses. It also pays to understand the culture of each market - is home ownership seen as a measure of success, or is perpetual renting the norm?In the wake of near-zero interest rates, property prices have accelerated in many countries, including those in Asia-Pacific where the price-to-income ratio (a measure of affordability) has soared. Governments may therefore offer subsidies to first-time buyers, which can bode well for developers in the lower-end space.When examining the more cyclical commercial property developers, begin by looking at economic data. Stronger growth and expansionary monetary policies usually suggest an increase in business activity. Therefore, warehouses, factories, and retail assets will be highly sought after. The expansion in the service industry will also propel demand for office space.After that, drill down and explore the factors unique to each industry and the location of the property. For example, when researching hotels, you should examine the growth in tourist arrivals. Another significant factor is the expansion of e-commerce, with demand for retail space suffering in favour of high-tech warehousing space in Asia-Pacific.Land - the crucial raw materialMost developers possess a land bank, but this is an asset that can be depleted if not replenished promptly. Companies do participate in public auctions of land released by governments - in Singapore, this is known as the Government Land Sales Programme. Developers can also choose to buy land from private owners. The key to land parcels is location, location and location.Alternatively, developers may acquire old buildings. While this can be less expensive than participating in auctions, such activity raises questions about the time and cost-effectiveness of renovating or converting an existing asset. In some areas, they may also \"land bank\" through the conversion of one use of land to another, subject to the jurisdiction of the local authority.Study the developerThere are key performance metrics you can employ in the study of developers. Sell-through rates for recently launched projects can be an indication of company performance, track record and reputation. Observe changes in overall transaction volume, also known as transaction velocity, as there is a strong correlation between share prices and property transaction prices (as measured by Property Price Index) and volume.Changes in unsold inventory can indicate cyclical upswings and downswings. As a value measure, share price to Revalued Net Asset Value, (RNAV - which is the book value of development property plus revaluation surplus) is a useful metric. During an up cycle, this ratio may range from around 0.9 to 1.5. On the other hand, a bear market can see this ratio range from 0.3 to 0.6.A study of how a developer manages its working capital (WC) requirement is helpful. Such an assessment should begin by analysing how it raises WC and its implications on the cost of capital and risk. At the same time, find out if the developer requires a higher level of WC in different areas of its operations, such as projects in other countries. Investors also need to note the developer's capital-allocation strategy in apportioning money to acquiring land parcels, developing properties and other competing uses.Another variation on the straightforward business model is the outsourcing of construction to contractors, as well as sub-contractors. A developer's essential competency rests on having a keen eye for acquiring reasonably priced land parcels and developing these into coveted real estate trophies. While doing this, its management may decide to focus on what generates value for the business and outsource the construction segment. When extracting value from construction, the core competency differs - in this case, execution and cost control form the recipe for success. If this is the variation, then capital and WC requirements will be lower.Sources of capitalFunding is critical for property development projects. External sources of money may come from bank loans, bond financing, share-rights issuance, or some other form of equity financing. Where a property developer has obtained funding, do take the time to understand its structure because this can impact returns, especially if the company is highly geared.Risks - analyse these under a microscopeA developer may successfully bid for land during a boom only to experience a subsequent market correction. Alternatively, it may pay too much for land plots.There may also be a supply shock with too many projects being completed all at once. This oversupply can be exacerbated by macroeconomic downturns, depressing both prices and take-up rates. Highly leveraged developers are acutely exposed when there is a double whammy of falling prices and risk-averse buyers.Government intervention in the market is a further source of risk. Developers may experience the adverse consequence arising from regulatory policy changes designed to curb a perceived bubble.This column is an excerpt from the joint research by CFA Institute, Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and CRISIL, entitled \"Sector Analysis: An Investors Framework\".

The space is mostly vacant and the Murdayas are expected to lease it out.The S$2,450 psf the family is paying for levels 9 and 10 is higher than the S$2,294 psf that it paid for Level 24 in late-2016. It picked up Level 25 for S$1,278 psf in 2009.Cushman & Wakefield brokered the sale of levels 9 and 10.Meanwhile, at Springleaf Tower in Anson Road, the 20th floor has changed hands for S$25 million or S$2,419 psf. The 37-storey building is on a site with about 77 years' balance lease.The seller is Hequ Trading, controlled by an Asif family, and is engaged mainly in trading bulk products such as palm oil, rice, margarine, shortening and soaps, according to information on its website. Hequ is a related company of The Royal Group Indonesia, which produces and distributes palm oil products.The buyer is understood to be a unit of a Hong Kong-headquartered company that supplies steel mill rolls.CBRE is understood to have brokered the deal.Last month, BT reported that the 20th floor of Samsung Hub, a 999-year leasehold building in Church Street in the Raffles Place financial district, was sold for S$46.62 million or S$3,550 psf - busting the previous high of S$3,500 psf in the building,Knight Frank Singapore head of research and consultancy Alice Tan said: \"There seems to be a gradual recovery in strata office transaction volumes in the first five months of this year, in the light of rising office rents especially in the CBD.\"We are seeing more enquiries for strata offices since late last year - mostly from foreign investors; no additional buyer's stamp duty is payable for commercial property unlike for residential property.\"Sammi Lim, director of capital markets at CBRE, who brokered the deal at Samsung Hub, says the majority of those evaluating purchase of strata offices in the CBD are looking to occupy the space themselves. \"This is especially against the backdrop of rising office rents, with the trend projected to continue in view of tighter office supply in the next couple of years.\"\"For similar reasons, investors are also returning to the market with prospects of capital appreciation,\" she added.Ms Tan of Knight Frank said that foreigners keen to buy strata offices to set up their businesses here are from South-east Asia, Hong Kong and China. \"Some are in trading; we have also seen those in financial-related services. They could be start-ups, while others are establishing a regional office here.\"Of course another motivation for buying their office premises instead of leasing space is the potential of capital appreciation in the future. Prices of strata offices seem to have bottomed with 999-year/freehold properties in choice locations in the CBD leading the price recovery.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

These expenses comprise removal allowance of $10,000 per flat and payment of stamp and legal fees.Residents are also assured allocation of a new flat at the replacement site, if eligible.Other rehousing benefits include a Sers grant of $15,000 for singles, or $30,000 for joint singles and families, if eligible, for the purchase of the replacement flat.Eligible Sers flat owners may also opt to take up an ex-gratia payment of up to $60,000 on top of their compensation for their flats, instead of the Sers rehousing benefits.Construction of 630 replacement flats, located near MacPherson MRT and the Pan Island Expressway, will start in the third quarter of 2019 and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2023. The flats are near the Circuit Road food centre and the MacPherson market and food centre.Registration for new replacement flats will start in the second quarter of 2019.Owners of the commercial properties - the 27 shops and two eating houses - will be given compensation based on the market value of their units at the time of the Sers announcement.They may opt to buy a new unit on a 30-year lease based on selling prices fixed at market value as at the time of the Sers announcement. They may also rent a new unit based on the prevailing market rent at the time of letting, or choose not to take up a new unit and receive an ex-gratia payment pegged at 10 per cent of the market value of the existing unit.The last Sers project involved eight blocks comprising 994 flats in West Coast Road, with residents offered new replacement units in Clementi Avenue 1 and West Coast Link.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Owners of the 226-unit freehold property in Farrer Road known as Spanish Village are asking for S$882 million, jumping on the bandwagon of collective sales hopefuls in the prime districts.So far, 25 collective sale sites in districts 9, 10 and 11 have concluded, chalking up S$5.5 billion in total sale proceeds and a median land rate of S$1,664 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), based on The Business Times' compilation.There are at least 10 other launched redevelopment sites in the prime districts waiting for buyers.Edmund Tie & Company, the marketing agent for Spanish Village, said that the asking price for the freehold residential site reflects a land rate of S$1,721 psf ppr, inclusive of a development charge of about S$30 million.Built in the 1980s and spanning 331,457 sq ft, the site is zoned for residential use with a gross plot ratio of 1.6.The area is surrounded by schools such as Nanyang Primary School, Raffles Girls' Primary School, Nanyang Girls' High School, The Chinese High School, Anglo-Chinese School (International), Hwa Chong Institution and National Junior College.\"With all the surrounding good schools and proximity to lifestyle options and CBD, the location holds great appeal for families with school-going children and expatriates alike,\" said Edmund Tie & Company's senior director of investment advisory Tan Chun Ming. \"URA's recent tender award of the Holland Village GLS (government land sale) site for a mixed-use and pedestrian-oriented development will also add to the vibrancy of the locale.\"JLL senior consultant Karamjit Singh noted that the en bloc upswing from 2016 to 2018 year-to-date was led by the bottom-end of the private residential market as strong demand for mass-market homes and shortage of land kick-started the en bloc wave.As land prices rose for the bottom end of the market, the upper tiers of the market are starting to look relatively under-priced. This in turn spurred en bloc sales in the medium to upper-end segments.But he pointed out that prime land does not interest all types of developers. \"Some would prefer mass market sites as they are good at building such homes. They also feel the size of demand for affordable homes is much wider as such projects mainly cater to HDB upgraders to whom additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) and total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) are less of an issue.\"On the other hand, developers who specialise in the luxury end would welcome opportunities to build what they are good at,\" Mr Singh said, adding that Singapore's luxury home market still compares favourably to several global peers, despite the ABSD payable by foreigners.Savills Singapore senior director Alan Cheong noted that the flavour of the season has swung to prime districts as developers have stocked up their landbanks with suburban and city-fringe sites. The prime property owners have also been waiting for prices to rise before pushing their units for collective sale, he said.Colliers International Singapore research head Tricia Song felt that the risk of an oversupply of launch units in the prime districts is low for now.\"We believe we are still in the early stages of recovery for the end-user and collective sale market for prime properties, especially given the dearth of prime land acquisitions between 2008-2017,\" she said.\"We believe prime sites, especially those located near an MRT station and are competitively priced, will continue to attract developers' attention.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Over the decades, strong public policy support may have led to an over-emphasis on housing ownership, leading to unintended consequences, says one observer.File photo of HDB flats. (Photo: Hester Tan)SINGAPORE: Singapore is frequently lauded when it comes to housing policy.Its home ownership rate of more than 90 per cent of the population is one of the highest in the world and is much higher than the home ownership rates in developed countries.Among developed urban centres like Seoul, Tokyo or Hong Kong, Singaporeans occupy a large per square foot per person of living space.Our public housing programme is well known for its quality of construction and design, including complementary amenities such as community centres, playgrounds, shops, sport facilities and so on.While in most countries, public housing is meant for low-income households, in Singapore, it provides options for nearly all socio-economic classes.FROM THE SLUMS TO A HOME-OWNING SOCIETYIn the 1950s, most of Singapore was living in slum-like, overcrowded conditions, with poor sanitation, safety standards and construction quality. Many lived in squatter settlements of attap, wood and zinc.Dysentery, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue thrived in these unsanitary and crowded living conditions. The fertility rate of the time was more than five children per woman versus the roughly one child per woman now, exacerbating the misery.When the Peoples Action Party came to power in 1959, it made housing a high priority. Apart from the aforementioned reasons, the Government wanted to build a home-owning society where people felt they had a stake in the country and would work hard to contribute to society.The social stability it engendered also turned out to be a positive in attracting many multinationals to set up shop in Singapore, improving the economy of Singapore and the lives of people.The Housing Development Board (HDB) was set up in 1960. Within 10 years, the HDB housed 35 per cent of the population, and by the 1980s, 85 per cent of the population.Housing quality also improved over the decades and by this century, many of the newer flats look little different physically from private apartments.OVER THE YEARS, INCREASING SUPPORT FOR SINGAPOREANS TO OWN A HOMEBy the late 1980s, housing security was mostly solved with home ownership hovering at around 90 per cent of the population from 1990 till present.Yet, policies to encourage home ownership did not let up.From the late 1980s to mid 1990s, many policies were introduced to encourage home ownership, including the lifting of income and Central Provident Fund (CPF) restrictions for the purchase of HDB resale flats, allowing CPF savings to be used for private housing, and to pay for mortgage interest payments.During this time, the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme was introduced, as was the HDB upgrading programme.RETIREMENT ADEQUACY, PRESSURES ON PRICES, NEW EXPECTATIONSCommentaries, academic papers and organisations like the OECD and the International Monetary Fundhave said that the use of CPF for housing has resulted in retirement inadequacy, with excessive withdrawals for housing at the expense of CPF balances at retirement.In response to President Halimah Yacobs recent call for bold ideas during the recent opening of Parliament, one economist even suggested that the CPF be restricted to no longer be used to pay for housing, seeing that housing prices may not rise indefinitely.The high support for home ownership has given rise to expectations, with the Government now unfortunately bearing responsibility for any perceived negatives in our current housing, including housing prices, and receiving little praise for any positives.This includes recent concerns around HDB 99-year leases, where many find the idea that a HDB flat value may depreciate as it runs down the leaseto be unpalatable, even though the leasehold condition is well publicised.READ:Singapore's public housing policy has done its job splendidly, but it's time for a makeover, a commentary.READ:99-year HDB leases a chance to review home ownership and retirement policies, a commentary.To compound issues, our population is ageing fast. By 2030, as much as one quarter of our resident population may be over 65, many of them living in larger-than-needed flats, as their children leave the nest or as their partner passes away.If many choose to fund their retirement by monetising their houses, they may run into an oversupply of flats on the market, lowering resale prices.Addressing the 99-year leasehold issue or the retirement security issuewithout a cost to the home ownerwould effectively need a cross subsidy from future tax payers.Any changes to housing policy that impact prices would need to consider the fact that most voting Singaporeans have a vested interest in keeping house prices up.The continuous subsidy of housing in Singapore has been underpinned by the Land Acquisition Act of 1966, which had used historical cost for acquiring land, managing to keep new HDB flat prices low. In 1959, the State owned 44 per cent of all land, and by the mid-2000s, it was 85 per cent.Effectively, the Government redistributed land wealth from land owners to the rest of the population, aided by a growing economy supporting prices. This, however, cannot continue forever as housing leases start to run out, our economy slows, and our population ages.The Government had, over the decades since independence, resisted calls to liberally expand the social safety net, in order to avoid the development of an entitlement culture that once you give someone something, you cannot easily take it back without antagonising that person, and you may end up with an intolerable burden for future generations.Yet, housing remains one social programme where much resources have been poured into.OVER-CONSUMPTION OF HOUSINGYou over-consume when that consumption is at the expense of something else without significantly increasing the satisfaction from that consumption.Despite CPF contribution rates hovering between 30 to 50 per cent for most of its existence, some older Singaporeans face retirement security issues.Many say its our rising cost of living, but we should also consider what happens when we take out CPF to fund housing.A house is not just a shelter. It is also a leveraged financial asset. You are taking risk on both property pricesand interest rates. Singapores rapid growth over the first 50 years from independence has led many people to believe that home ownership is a sure win, as house prices also rose from wage and population growth.Even then, we received a sobering lesson in the late-1990s, when housing prices crashed. We have only recovered to 1996 price levels in the last several years.A slowing economy, resistance to immigration and an ageing population suggest that housing prices may not rise as astronomically in the future.The amount of capital that is not used for housing, can be invested in economic activities.Pension funds in other countries invest in stock markets globally, private equity, fixed income, and other diversified investments that preserve wealth, improve retirement security, and encourage economic activity. Singaporeans score highly for assets, but it is mostly tied up in housing, insurance, CPF or bank deposits.Home ownership means mortgages for most. Having to service a mortgage can discourage risk-taking behaviourneeded in entrepreneurship, in changing careers or in finding jobs overseas.In the economy of the past, Singapore serviced manufacturing multinationals who needed reliable labour. In the economy of the future, we need to encourage risk-taking and a more fluid, adaptable labour market.TIME FOR A CHANGE IN HOUSING POLICYIt is wonderful that Singaporeans can take for granted their housing security. We have essentially resolved the housing security problem since the 1990s.A major benefit of housing security was social stability, which encouraged foreign investments, mostly in manufacturing.But do these drivers for our existing housing policy still exist today?It is my view that we should separate housing security from asset appreciation and recognise that we may be over-consuming housing at the expense of retirement adequacy, allocation of investments into economic activity, and inculcating desirable attitudes needed for a new economy.Housing policy needs to be reconsidered now while Singapore still has the time and the means to correct course, while catering to a class of existing home owners.Tan Jin Meng is a postgraduate from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy with an interest in social policy and economics."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Instead, that has been its modus operandi since day one.When the firm was established in 2000 as OrangeTee, it was an online property and valuation portal first, with a few property agents. Only later that year did it become a full-fledged agency.As such, the firm had a technology department - and a focus on technology - right from the start, says managing director Steven Tan.\"Even after the dotcom bubble burst, we wanted to continue with the internet,\" he said.One early move was the introduction of an online Work@Home portal for agents, shortly after the turn of the millennium.Still in use today, the portal includes information about projects and searchable property market data.One important feature is \"My OT Account\", launched in 2004, which gives agents an overview of their performance and transactions.The portal is particularly helpful for team leaders who oversee other agents, says Mr Tan. \"In the past, leaders had to keep track of agents' transactions (manually)\" - in an Excel file, for instance. With the portal, a team leader has easy access to team members' transactions without the need to manually keep records.After its early digital start, the firm has continued to evolve and grow. In 2013 and 2014, it was among the winners of the Enterprise 50 awards. Organised by The Business Times and KPMG, the annual awards honour Singapore's 50 most enterprising privately-held local companies.OrangeTee & Tie - formed in 2017 as a joint venture between OrangeTee's agency division and Edmund Tie & Co Property Network - is now Singapore's third largest property agency.New players, new challengers\"In early 2015, we actually saw a change in the world,\" says Mr Tan. Previously, the industry's focus was on productivity, he notes. \"But that's not enough with disruption.\"\"The challenge is no longer just to improve your product to compete with competitors.\"OrangeTee & Tie's traditional competitors are other property agencies. But recent years have seen new players entering the scene: from property technology or \"proptech\" firms, to portals that offer the do-it-yourself approach, or flat transaction fees for individual buyers and sellers.\"That's when we started to think: how can we transform our business?\" says Mr Tan.Aware that this would not be a one-off effort, OrangeTee & Tie formed a transformation taskforce that remains active today, comprising staff from different departments and age groups.The taskforce has since introduced new initiatives and refreshed old ones. One overhaul was to OrangeTee & Tie's mobile app for agents, introduced in 2010 and now into its second version.In August, the firm plans to launch the third version of the app. Some features will be radically upgraded. These include the \"project information\" feature, which has details of properties that are being marketed.The new version offers greater interactivity. For example, selecting a specific floor plan calls up a list of all the blocks and floors in that project with such units. If a specific unit is selected, its location is instantly indicated on a map of the entire project.The app also makes it easy to share such information with clients via platforms such as WhatsApp.In addition, the app will boast an upgraded financial calculator, used by agents to help clients work out their financial options. The current version was developed in-house, whereas the new version was created in partnership with a bank.Agents will also find it more convenient to post listings. The current app only allows them to post to OrangeTee & Tie's own portal, but soon they will be able to post on a range of listing portals from within the app, thanks to tie-ups with these third-party websites.Brand new features include an online valuation service - also developed in partnership with a bank - and a library of electronic direct mailers, giving instant access to these notices which agents can post on social media or send out to clients.This follows the launch of a personalised electronic direct mailer tool earlier this year, which makes it easy to create such marketing materials. Agents no longer need to use graphics editing software to insert their own photograph and contact details into a template.After its launch in August, the revamped app will continue to be updated, with plans to add new features such as research resources and data analytics later this year.The next big thingOrangeTee & Tie aims to stay sensitive to the latest trends. In 2016, for instance, it introduced a rating platform that lets clients rate and comment on agents' service quality.This was inspired by the growing importance of customer reviews on hotel and accommodation portals, says Mr Tan. \"People rely on reviews to make decisions.\"The idea was thus to build trust with customers via technology: \"They must trust the agent before they can engage (him or her),\" says Mr Tan.\"We want to make sure that customers can make informed decisions.\" The ratings system also motivates agents to provide better service, he adds.Not all innovations have to be developed in-house. Earlier this year, OrangeTee & Tie piloted the use of a chatbot in marketing a new condominium called The Tapestry, making use of Facebook Messenger's chatbot option.Traditionally, interested buyers would go to a project's website to search for information.In the case of The Tapestry, they could instead ask the chatbot questions - from \"May I have the floor plan please?\" to \"Can I make an appointment to view the showroom?\" - and receive immediate answers.Once contacted, the chatbot would provide an agent's contact details, and maintain engagement with the customer over time by giving updates about the project.Partnerships and collaborations are other ways in which OrangeTee & Tie moves forward.In March this year, the agency worked with a bank to introduce e-invoices and e-payments. Take-up was swift, with about 80 per cent of payments - including agents' commissions - now made online.That same month, OrangeTee & Tie also announced a collaboration with online marketplace Carousell.Since May, verified reviews of agents from OrangeTee & Tie's site have been integrated into Carousell's existing user feedback system. Users who browse Carousell's property listings can thus see how the agents behind the listings are rated.In some ways, OrangeTee & Tie is moving faster than the industry can handle. Next year, it will introduce a paperless \"document management system\" for transactions. This will allow all paperwork to be handled digitally, with no need for hard copies.But there is one major stumbling block: Singapore's regulations do not yet recognise e-signatures. At the final stage, the customer will still have to sign a physical document, which the agent will then scan and upload into the digital system.Changing from withinThe real estate industry's biggest challenge is in keeping up with customers themselves, says Mr Tan. \"The expectations of customers are getting higher,\" he observes.With customers now having access to a wealth of information, it is tougher for agents to add value, he says. That is why OrangeTee & Tie is embarking on a data analytics push, building a \"data warehouse\" and gaining in-house capabilities.The hope is that by using data analytics, agents will be able to provide better insights for customers, going beyond existing transaction data to look at patterns in en bloc sales or trends in how the property market is related to the stock market.Data analytics can also be used to help OrangeTee & Tie's developer clients make decisions about future launches, by looking for patterns in aspects such as demographics and take-up rates for different unit types.Internally, the firm could even analyse financial or human resources data to aid decision-making and assess the effectiveness of initiatives.Earlier this year, the firm began a six-month tie-up with Ngee Ann Polytechnic to learn about data visualisation.And instead of hiring data scientists, it is training selected staff who have an existing background in real estate or business. \"They know the industry better. That's very important,\" says Mr Tan.Developing data capabilities in-house, instead of simply hiring from outside the real estate industry, is part of OrangeTee & Tie's overall approach to transformation: led from the top, but involving those on the frontlines as well.After all, property agents are free to choose their agencies.There are practical benefits to joining an agency that has initiatives such as its own app. \"Agents are happy because they don't have to pay (for third-party apps),\" notes Mr Tan.But on another level, this self-selection means that OrangeTee & Tie's transformation efforts are complemented by agents who are keen to keep up, and who may even have chosen the agency for its forward-looking nature.Or as Mr Tan puts it: \"Those people who come to OrangeTee, they are ready to learn new things.\"Brought to you by The Future Economy Council"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

At least 1,000 buyers and agents were there at 11pm; most of the buyers being upgraders and investors, he reckoned.The measures by the government, aimed at cooling the property market and keep price escalations in line with economic fundamentals, were to kick in the moment the clock struck 12.The ABSD rates for Singaporeans and PRs buying their first residential property would remain at 0 per cent and 5 per cent respectively; but those buying their second or subsequent home would face a 5 percentage point increase in ABSD.Foreigners buying any property would face a 20 per cent ABSD, up from the current 15 per cent.Entities buying residential property will also be affected by the new rules. Instead of the current 15 per cent, they will now face a 25 per cent ABSD. Moreover, developers buying residential properties for housing development will face an additional, non-remittable ABSD of 5 per cent to be paid upfront upon purchase.From Friday, loan-to-value (LTV) limits will also be tightened by five percentage points for all housing loans granted by financial institutions.These revised LTV limits will apply to loans for residential property purchases where the option to purchase is granted on or after July 6. But they do not apply to loans granted by HDB.LTV limits for mortgage equity withdrawal loans (MWLs) will be tightened to 75 per cent for a borrower with no outstanding housing loan for the purchase of another residential property; for a borrower with an outstanding housing loan, it will be 45 per cent for another residential purchase.Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said in a statement: \"The government has been monitoring the property market closely. We are very concerned that prices are running ahead of economic fundamentals.\"There is a large supply of units coming on stream and interest rates are going up. We want to avoid a severe correction later, which can have more destabilising consequences. Hence we are acting now to maintain a stable and sustainable property market.\" The Ministry of Finance, Ministry of National Development and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the changes in a joint statement.Dr Lee Nai Jia, senior director and head of research at Knight Frank, said buyer demand would certainly be dampened, and that this could lead to a 30 to 40 per cent fall in sales.Prices could even drop to levels seen in the fourth quarter last year, he said.Buyers seeking replacement homes could start moving into HDB flats or cheaper and smaller properties, he said.But analysts said, given that the ABSD adjustments do not affect Singaporeans and PRs buying their first home, genuine home-buyer demand may not be as affected.JLL's senior consultant Karamjit Singh said: \"Developers will be concerned about how buyers react and the impact is likely to be felt the most for high-end properties - where foreigners and investors have the biggest presence.\"But on the supply side, land acquisition would be hit, since developers have to pay a 5 per cent ABSD even if they finish selling all their units within five years, said Desmond Sim, head of research in Singapore and Southeast Asia for CBRE.\"It will bring up the cost of land acquisition, and will see a lot of second consideration when it comes to building developments with a large number of units,\" he said.The collective sale fever will be adversely affected as the change adds to both the costs to developers and to sellers who need to buy replacement homes, said Nicholas Mak, executive director of ZACD Group.Some property analysts wondered whether the measures might have been taken too hastily, given that prices have been rising only since the middle of last year.But CIMB Private Bank economist Song Seng Wun said it was a sign of the government \"trying to stay ahead of the curve\". \"If macrofundamentals were to weaken when the bulk of supply comes on stream, we could have a far bigger correction,\" he said.\"Given that they have the previous cycle to look back on, they are well aware of the risk that when sentiment takes hold, it can lead to very rapid price movement. They may not want to see prior cycles repeated.\"He added that if this action does not take the steam off, policy-makers could also contemplate measures later on such as tightening lending to developers borrowing to purchase sites.Read More:"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The combined strata floor area is about 39,590 sq ft, and commands about 27.3 per cent of the Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) share value, CBRE said.According to the real estate firm, each strata floor can be partitioned into smaller units to cater to different businesses, or leased to multiple tenants.As the properties are zoned \"commercial\", they are not subject to additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) or seller's stamp duty (SSD), and are eligible for purchase by local and foreign buyers.GB Building is situated close to Amoy Street Food Centre and within walking distance to three MRT Stations - Tanjong Pagar station on the East-West Line, Telok Ayer station on the Downtown Line, and the upcoming Shenton Way station on the Thomson-East Coast Line.Said CBRE director of capital markets Sammi Lim, who expects interest to be strong: \"This is a rare opportunity for investors to own substantial strata commercial floors in a building, and hold a significant stake in the MCST. The units offer immediate rental income, while providing flexibility for end-user occupation in the medium to long term.\"She added that recent strata office transactions at SBF Centre, located just next to GB Building, were in the range of $2,800 psf to $3,053 psf, and that podium floors are rarely available for sale, with the last such transaction in the central business district being Prudential Tower in 2017, which was sold at about $3,316 psf.\"In addition to the ongoing rejuvenation in the area, the government's development plans for Tanjong Pagar as the next waterfront city will have positive knock-on effects on both capital and rental values of existing developments in this vicinity,\" Ms Lim said.CBRE is the sole marketing agent for this EOI exercise, which closes at 3pm on Sept 5."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(File photo: TODAY/Ooi Boon Keong)SINGAPORE: The redevelopment of ageing properties is an important stage in the life cycle of urbanised cities with limited land supply.For a small country like Singapore, when houses built in the countrys early years age, redevelopment becomes increasingly pertinent both from an economic and urban renewal perspective.Ageing houses, if not redeveloped, have significant implications for the community and individuals due to changing demographic, lifestyle and housing needs.WHEN THE STARS ALIGN FOR A FAMILY OF FOURFor a typical family of two parents with two children living in a typical 4-room flat, after both kids get married, set up their families and move out of the flat, their parents end up with two excess rooms in their flat.Daily chores of upkeeping their flats may unnecessarily strain the old couple who would be in their fifties or sixties by then. So right-sizing to a smaller flat is an attractive option to monetise their large flat and supplement their financial needs, especially after retirement.The option works perfectly well, if the balance lease of their flat is still relatively long and can fetch a good price from a buyer with the requisite financing. This scenario holds in the case where they bought the flat directly from HDB at the age of 25 and retire at the age of say 65.By then, their house will be around 45 years old, taking into account the construction and waiting time of approximately five years, with a balance lease of around 54 years.However, if the parents choose to continue to live in their flat until their last days, they may sell it to the Government through the Lease Buyback Scheme and have some money for their golden years.If they dont, their children may inherit the old flat after their parents pass on with a balance lease of around 30 or less years, but choose to sell it off.After all, the flat value is likely to depreciate as it reaches the tail-end of the lease termand will ultimately be returned together with the land to the state, when the lease expires.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?But should their children wait until the lease runs out?Some say why not, for they may be picked for the selective en bloc redevelopment scheme (SERS). But supposing they dont, most older flats with a short balance lease are unlikely to command premiums in the resale market.Any potential buyerwill probably only pay for the use value of the flat taking into account the remaining lease term.The family should also bear in mind that SERS has only applied to only approximately 4 per cent of the HDB flats with significant redevelopment potential, conditioned on there being sufficient space for replacement flats to be built nearby.Many say despite the small chance for SERS, a large number of buyers will still flock to the resalemarket to pay high prices for old flats in good locations but this is a scenario that will be less likely in the future.Why? Ever since Minister of National Development Lawrence Wong tackled this issue of irrational housing choices made by some buyers in a Facebook post last year and explicitly mentioned that land on which leases have expired will be returned to the Government, the ground has shifted.The issue of decaying HDB leases has remained in the spotlight since, and public housings relationship to Singapores social compact further complicates the issue.Heated debates among parties have ensued, between cynics who place little hope on possible government intervention and others who hold onto unrealistic expectations hoping that the Government would at least dole out some candies when HDB flat leases expire.CLEARING THE AIR ON LEASE EXTENSIONPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has cleared the air at the National Day Rally with the announcement of the expanded Home Improvement Programme (HIP II) and Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) in dealing with this hot-button issue.PM Lee explained in great lengthwhy lease extension is not an economically sustainable solution, consistent with the notion of sustainable development defined in the United Nations Report of the World Commission on Environmental and Development (1987) - that is:Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.Lease extension is not a desirable answer to the paradox of ageing flats and a longstanding social compact of housing as a form of social security from the perspective of urban land use and preserving economic value.Land reclamation is not a panacea to land scarcity problems in many countries, including Singapore. Long-termland-use planning is necessary to ensure that there is sufficient land for future land useand housing needs.Lease extension without intensification of use impedes the long-term growth of a city. It foils land optimisation, prevents new, innovative land uses and leaves open questions about the quality of land use.If old, low-density housing blocks are preserved through lease extension, more land must be sourced for new public housing flats to meet the growing demand by residents including supporting infrastructure for any new towns likeroads, sewerage system, and amenities such as schools, markets and neighbourhood shops.There are also limits to the heritage argument of conserving huge swaths of homogenous HDB flats which might have little unique architectural features.While some mightargue for the need to keep some older HDB flats to preserve the unique charm and character of HDB neighbourhoods, maintaining these HDB blocks, which were in all likelihood built to last for as long as their leases, will come at a higher cost with time, and strain residents and public coffers.The last anyone wants is for beloved HDB flats to become liabilities. Old and dilapidated buildings could choke off urban revitalisation, whichruns counter to sustaining a modern city.Functional and economic obsolescence may also set in earlier, due to changing lifestyle and demographics. While smart home features may appeal to younger, more tech savvy families, its fixtures like non-slip floor tiles, grab bars, ramp that are more useful when people age.BACK TO THE FUTUREBack to our family of two parents whose kids have moved out. If the parents want to age in their homes, but dont want to subscribe to the Lease Buyback Scheme, there are now safeguards in place to help cushion that scenario.Though details are pending, the newly proposed VERS may allay their concerns of lease decaying, giving an option for HDB residents to vote to return their balance leases to the government. But it depends on whether their neighbours say yes too.HIP II, on the other hand, will help improve and rectify common wears-and-tears, and provide them with a living space that is safe, secure and pleasant, even after 60 years.Most importantly, the Governments stand on not pursuing lease extension is firm and clear, and serves as a forewarning to those buying older flats that the Government has no intention of granting an extension of lease. So that should moderate the property market.MINDSET CHANGE NEEDEDPerhaps the issue is a need for a change in peoples notions ofpublic housing. One should be mindful of thegoals of public housing - that is to promote homeownership while ensuring theiraffordability and sustainability.Public housing, in the form of BTO flats, have aimed to provide a lifetimes home to one household at a time and the moves at the National Day Rally have served to reinforce this objective in the face of expiring leases.If public housing is exploited for private benefit, and home buyers continue to speculate in old flats, future generations may have to bear the effects of higher housing prices, as land resources are gradually depleted over time.Sing Tien Foo is Director of the Institute of Real Estate Studies (IRES), National University of Singapore.

Over at Jalan Jurong Kechil, three offers were submitted, far fewer than the record 24 bids submitted last year for a nearby Toh Tuck Road plot that has since been developed into Daintree Residence.The executive condominium (EC) market, however, continues to register healthy interest amid a shortage of supply. A site along Canberra Link pulled in nine bids, said the Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Tuesday evening.These were the first state tender closings since the property cooling measures kicked in on July 6.Tan Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy for JLL Singapore, said: \"The tender results reflect developers' cautious stance in general, and for private housing sites in particular... given that the additional cooling measures have a greater impact on demand for private homes.\"In the 99-year, 153,223 sq ft Jalan Jurong Kechil residential site, the highest offer came from a tie-up between COHL Singapore and CSC Land Group (Singapore); the bid was S$215 million, or a land rate of S$1,002 psf.CSC Land Group (Singapore) is a unit of China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd; COHL Singapore belongs to Jiak Kim Propco Sarl, which has a Luxembourg address, a search with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) found.Two other bids were submitted - one from Hao Yuan Investment for S$163.8 million, and another from Sim Lian Land for S$130 million.Ms Tay said that the COHL/CSC bid would give rise to an estimated selling price of S$1,600 to S$1,700 per sq ft - just under the S$1,702 per sq ft average transacted price for the nearby Daintree Residence.At the Government Land Sales (GLS) site at Dairy Farm Road, United Engineers' UED Residential submitted the top bid of S$368.8 million, or S$830.4 psf per gross floor area (GFA).Closely following was the offer from MCC Group's MCC Land (Singapore) and Greatview Group and Yu Zhisong's Greatview Investment, for S$364.9 million.The lowest bid was from Wee Hur Development, which placed a S$228.8 million offer.COHL Singapore and CSC Land Group (Singapore), and Chip Eng Seng Corporation's CEL Property Development were also in the fray.The 211,486 sq ft site is for residential development with commercial uses on the first storey.United Engineers' group managing director Roy Tan told The Business Times by phone that he was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. \"We put in a reasonable bid that was not too aggressive... and put in a sufficient discount to the Hillview Rise site,\" he said.The nearby Hillview Rise GLS site was clinched by Hong Leong Group on July 3 for S$460 million, or S$1,067 psf ppr.Dr Lee Nai Jia, senior director and head of research at Knight Frank, said the prices at the two GLS sites are \"reflective of what has been transacted in that area... rather than future pricing\". He added that the tender results could be a \"wake-up call\" to en bloc hopefuls such as the nearby Dairy Farm condo. \"Developers are still going in, but the prices are more rationalised now,\" he said.Marketing agent Teakhwa Real Estate, which is marketing The Dairy Farm's en bloc effort, told BT on Tuesday evening that the development's reserve price will stay at S$1.68 billion.Managing director Sieow Teak Hwa said The Dairy Farm's location is nearer the train station than the plot for which the tender just closed, and The Dairy Farm is freehold to boot.\"The price is reasonable when compared with other available en bloc sites,\" he said.The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said that a decision on the award of the tenders will be made after the bids have been evaluated.For the Canberra Link EC site, HDB announced on Tuesday evening that Hoi Hup Realty and Sunway Developments' bid came out tops at S$271 million, or S$558.22 psf.The second highest bidder was Greatview Investment and MCC Land (Singapore), with a bid of S$258.9 million. The lowest bidder was JBE Development with a bid of S$201.8 million or S$415.72 psf.The 99-year land parcel was launched for tender on June 28, for a 194,187 sq ft site that will yield an estimated 450 units.This was after a 2.7-hectare 820-unit EC site in Sumang Walk was awarded to City Developments and TID Residential. Their bid of S$509.4 million, or a record S$583 psf for EC land, had beat out 16 other contenders.Nicholas Mak, executive director for ZACD Group, said: \"The supply and demand mismatch in the EC market (depleting unsold stock and limited sites for EC development) has strengthened the attractiveness of the Canberra Link EC site. To some developers, EC development is a safer development option in this uncertain market.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "These scarce and highly prized cultural icons have an enduring, time-honoured appeal.FollowMY CHILDHOOD days were spent in a pre-war shophouse owned by my great-grandparents, who operated a traditional Chinese medical hall on the ground floor, and resided on the upper levels. I spent many a carefree afternoon playing with other children in the rear court, roaming along the five-foot way and hiding, up in the attic.Even though this row of traditional shophouses along Upper Bukit Timah Road has made way for new developments, those memories remain vivid in my mind, fuelling my interest in this asset class.Shophouses are an iconic part of Singapore's built environment, reflecting our multicultural influences in their architecture - from Malay roof eaves to decorative Peranakan tiles to the Art Deco facade popular in 1950s' architecture.Although many were lost during Singapore's urban development, those that remain today have to adhere to strict conservation rules and guidelines for restoration and adaptive reuse in a bid to preserve them.Investing in shophousesThe market for shophouses, though small due to their scarcity, is a lucrative one. They traditionally hold their value even during market downturns, and many investors are interested in owning a piece of heritage.Based on URA Realis data, total transaction value of shophouses hit a historical high in Q1 2018, topping the previous market peak in Q1 2013. This was supported by one or two large transactions. For the rest of 2018, we expect demand for shophouses to remain stable.In general, shophouses with a winning investment profile offer a prime location, prominent frontage, strong tenant profile and with approval for F&B, hospitality or retail use. Buyers are drawn to invest in shophouses for a number of reasons, including their heritage value, location or unique charm of a specific property or distinctive architecture. Upgraded shophouses, or those with potential for further enhancement also stand out to investors.The typical gross entry yield of shophouses is in the range of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, depending on the tenure of the site.Some buyers are willing to accept lower entry yields if they feel there is potential to rejuvenate the tenant mix or high possibility to value-add to the property. This could increase the current rents significantly leading to higher mid- to long-term yields.Otherwise, buyers usually favour stronger-yielding assets that provide them with greater stability to hedge against rising interest rates. There are also investors who are attracted to the heritage value or nostalgia factor of such properties and are willing to enter at lower yields to own a piece of history.Adjoining units of shophouses are prized assets as they offer higher space efficiency. Investors are attracted to the prospect of buying a row of shophouses as it is akin to buying a boutique building.It also gives them the flexibility of exploring change of use of the property by leveraging the larger floor plates. That said, single shophouses remain attractive as their quantums are more palatable.Investor profileUltra-high net worth individuals, who take mid- to long-term views on preserving their capital, are attracted to shophouses for their future capital appreciation. We also see steady interest from family offices or small and medium-sized businesses who buy shophouses for their own occupation to hedge against volatility in office rental cycles.With the positive rental outlook and tapering office supply pipeline, these businesses invest in shophouses as a strategy to lock in their long-term operational costs.Those who are drawn to the shophouse market tend to be seasoned investors who like the potential for capital appreciation and the yield play offered by this asset class.While those who traditionally invest in residential properties may consider alternative asset classes, we do not expect a strong surge in demand for shophouses simply because of the higher additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) rates on residential properties which took effect on July 6, 2018.Savvy investors will base their decisions on a host of factors such as the office rental market, interest-rate environment and macroeconomic conditions.CBRE foresees that demand for shophouses as well as strata offices will remain consistent in the next two to three years against the backdrop of tight office supply and rising rents.Recent trendsIn general, prices of shophouses have remained stable, with a few stand-out assets traded at higher price points. In recent years, there are more shophouses put up for sale by families who have owned these properties for generations and are looking to divest and redistribute the funds.Most of these families had used the premises either as residences or offices. After moving or selling the business, they would be looking to make better use of their funds by cashing out as they no longer need the premises.There also appears to be a major shift in tenant profiles in shophouses, with strong demand from established F&B tenants and businesses keen to explore non-conventional office layouts and who like the feel of being in a low-rise heritage building. Owner occupiers also like the flexibility of being able to operate their businesses 24/7 out of a shophouse as well as the convenience of surrounding amenities.Shophouses in the CBD continue to remain popular with buyers due to their prime locations. That said, there is growing interest for shophouses in city-fringe locations such as Jalan Besar, Kampong Glam, Little India and in the east, specifically along East Coast Road and Joo Chiat Road.Some of these locations are seen to be under the radar and could present significant growth potential. Many of them have under-utilised plot ratios with potential to build a rear extension.This provides leverage to increase the gross floor area and flexibility to configure the floor space to suit the buyer's needs.Such units are highly sought-after as buyers believe they can \"perform their magic\" and exercise creativity in the restoration process, incorporating both old and new elements into the property.As scarce and highly prized cultural icons in Singapore, the biggest draw of shophouses as an asset class is that they will continue to be popular. Investors are also attracted by the intrinsic value in buying into a piece of heritage; where remnants of a bygone era or a chequered past are etched in stone.Sammi Lim is director of capital markets at CBRE.Click here for more Property 2018 stories."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Location is also a very important consideration. One area in Singapore that is attracting the attention of investors and industrialists is Woodlands, in the northern part of the island.Rising star in the northRecently, the government announced plans for the future development of Woodlands. The two most relevant development proposals that will have signficant impact on the Woodlands industrial property market are the North Coast Innovation Corridor (NCIC) and the Woodlands North Coast.The NCIC is slated to be a new economic corridor in the north. It will start from the Woodlands Regional Centre and stretch across the redeveloped Sembawang Shipyard, to the future Seletar Regional Centre and Punggol Digital District.The Woodlands North Coast - which is envisaged as a business cluster within the Woodlands Regional Centre - will form one in a belt of key growth nodes across Singapore's north and north-eastern area, bringing jobs closer to homes.This cluster will be well-connected to the upcoming Thomson-East Coast MRT Line and the cross-border rail link to Johor. Therefore, it could benefit from the development of Iskandar Malaysia in Johor.The North-South Corridor, a 21.5-km road linking Woodlands to the Singapore CBD, is also likely to be ready by 2026. The expressway will improve connectivity of Woodlands to the rest of Singapore.Hence, the business hub in Woodlands could attract industrialists and enterprises, especially those with business connections to Malaysia. According to the government, the development of Woodlands Regional Centre could create an estimated 100,000 jobs here.Woodlands industrial property price & rentals on the mendThe transacted prices and rental rates of industrial properties in Woodlands have begun recovering this year based on reported sales records. After falling for three years from 2014 to 2017, the median transacted price of 60-year leasehold industrial strata-titled units in Woodlands increased by 3.4 per cent to S$397 per square foot (psf) in the first seven months of 2018 from 2017.Transacted industrial property rentals in Woodlands have also improved modestly in 2018 after reaching a trough in 2015.The median rentals in the January to July 2018 period stood at S$1.43 psf per month, which was an improvement of 2.9 per cent from the median rentals in 2017 and a 9.2 per cent increase from that in 2015.Besides the attractive attributes of Woodlands, other factors may also have contributed to the improvement in industrial property prices and rentals for the area.In the past few years, the government's plans to redevelop the ageing landed industrial properties in Paya Lebar and Defu industrial estates had forced industrial businesses in these two estates to relocate. Some found that the suitable replacement industrial space in the north-east and eastern parts of Singapore were either limited or more expensive.As a result, these businesses relocated to the northern region, where there was a larger supply of industrial space that catered to their needs and was closer to their current location.Two industrial project launches in Woodlands in recent years - Mega @ Woodlands and Woodlands Connection - have enjoyed encouraging take-up.At Woodlands Connection, which was launched in the first quarter of this year, all 26 strata-terrace factories have been sold. At Mega @ Woodlands, more than 60 per cent of the project's 517 units have been taken up since sales began three years ago.Population catchmentOne advantage enjoyed by industrialists located in Woodlands is the proximity to the residential estates there.Industrial businesses can tap the resident population catchment to hire labour. The accessibility to a large labour force is an important consideration to many businesses. In return, the residents in Woodlands would have employment opportunities near their homes, resulting in a win-win situation.According to the Singapore Department of Statistics, the current resident population in Woodlands is estimated at 250,000. Using a straight-line projection, the projected population there by 2040 is estimated to be 268,000, which means an additional 18,000 residents. The large and growing population in Woodlands is another attraction for industrialists to locate their businesses there.Despite the strengths and exciting developments in and around Woodlands, its shortcoming is that it is not near a sea port.The major container port is in the southern part of Singapore. That said, industrial businesses that require frequent shipments of goods and materials from Malaysia would be drawn to the north.The industrial real estate landscape in Woodlands is projected to be transformed by the promising development and infrastructure plans for the region.Together with its positive inherent characteristics such as the large resident population, geographical proximity to Malaysia and the availability of modern industrial space, Woodlands is indeed the rising star in the north that many businesses would find attractive.Nicholas Mak is executive director and Jean Choo is an analyst at ZACD Group.Click here for more Property 2018 stories."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Aldgate House has a net lettable area (NLA) of 211,000 square feet including Grade A office, retail and ancillary spaces over two basements, ground, mezzanine and eight upper floors. It has an occupancy rate of 88 per cent and is achieving a passing yield of about 5 per cent.Noting that over 45 per cent of the office rentals in the building are below market rents in the Aldgate area, CDL said \"there is strong potential for positive rental reversions\". It added that the building's overall weighted-average unexpired lease term of 6.2 years (to lease breaks) and 7.9 years (to lease expiries) \"is attractive as this will provide stable recurring income to CDL\".CDL said Central London's office market outlook is positive as rental growth is expected to continue into 2021, bolstered by heightened demand and tightening of both existing office stock and new supply. Investment sales in the City of London area are also recording their highest level of activity since end-2015.Said CDL group chief investment officer Frank Khoo: \"A key focus for CDL is to grow our recurring income significantly over the next 10 years through acquisitions and organic growth which will help to mitigate the volatility of development projects. This acquisition will enhance CDL's recurring income portfolio.\"We see tremendous potential in this prime commercial building and we continue to believe that London will remain as a global financial hub. The vibrant Aldgate district is home to major occupiers from a diverse sector base including financial, fintech, insurance, legal, cultural and creative companies. It is also emerging as the heart of 'Digital London' and the presence of healthtech companies is expected to increase with plans to develop a world-class life sciences research facility in the vicinity.\"Mr Khoo also noted potential to undertake asset enhancement to add value to the property, for instance by refurbishing office spaces to increase the rental and converting unused areas into additional facilities such as a restaurant. Planning consent has been obtained for the creation of additional massing at the basement for a commercial gym.\"CDL will continue to seek opportunities in the UK to further enhance our recurring income streams,\" he said.This is CDL's second recurring income asset in the United Kingdom, after the prime freehold Development House office building acquired in 2016. The 28,000 sq ft property at Leonard Street, Shoreditch district, remains fully leased with vacant possession expected from Q3 2018. The site has obtained planning approval to be redeveloped into a nine-storey building consisting of over 72,000 sq ft of NLA.The acquisition of Aldgate House took place via the purchase of all units in The Aldgate House Unit Trust and the subscription of the entire issued share capital in Aldgate House General Partner Limited, both of which together hold 100 per cent interest in The Aldgate House Limited Partnership, which is the sole beneficial owner of the property and owns the beneficial title to it. The acquisition was funded via internal resources and is not expected to have any material impact on the net tangible assets or earnings per share of CDL Group for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2018."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Graphic: Authors. Data sources: HDB, Data.gov.sg)SINGAPORE: At the 2018 National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted efforts by the Government to rejuvenate and redevelop older HDB towns to avoid the situation where entire towns were built in a rush in the 1970s and 1980s from recurring.PM Lee explained: If we do not plan ahead, 99 years later, all the leases in such towns will expire around the same time, and all the flats will be returned to the state within a few years.We will have to find new homes for a lot of people at once. HDB will have to tear down and rebuild the old flats in a hurry I do not think that is a good idea. The towns will become construction sites all over again, with cranes all over the place.The large-scale planned redevelopment of older HDB estates, whether through the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) or otherwise, is important to prevent a sudden shock to public housing prices, when the removal of a large number of old housing flats from the public housing market creates a huge supply shortage.OUR EARLY HOUSING HISTORYA chief reason why we should not revert to the old model of building in a rush is that we had little choice in the past, but we do in Singapores future.Singapore faced acute housing shortage in the 1960s; and the housing problem was further aggravated by the Bukit Ho Swee fire in 1961 that destroyed thousands of houses and displaced many households.Many might not remember but the fire was a huge test of resolve for the nascent Housing & Development Board (HDB), set up on 1 February 1960 as the national housing agency to take over the roles of its predecessor, the Singapore Improvement Trust formed under the British colonial government.Already saddled with the challenge of meeting a housing crunch besetting a fledging polity that had just attained self-government from the British, the HDB pressed on with great gusto.It undertook a massive construction programme to supply a large volume of affordable housing with sanitation and access to clean drinking water to Singaporean families in a short time span. HDB completed nearly 667,575 dwelling units in several housing projects between 1960 and 1990.By 1990, Singapore had already achieved a very high rate of homeownership of 87 per cent. However, the housing construction programmes did not slow down thereafter, because of strong demand for new flats by Singaporean households.Since then, the housing market has seen ebbs and flows, almost in tandem with the economy.The Asian Financial crisis hit the region in 1997 and did not spare Singapores economy; the housing market wasbadly hit by the crisis. Demand dwindled rapidly from the peak in 1997, and many Singaporeans withdrew their applications from the system leaving behind 17,000 unsold flats in HDBs inventory in 2001.To manage changes in demand, and maintain the stability of housing prices, HDB introduced the Built-to-Order (BTO) programme in 2002. It also scaled back its building programmes between 2005 and 2010.THE OLDEST NEIGHBOURHOODS WORRY ABOUT PRICE STABILITYMaintaining the stability of housing prices has been a key driving force behind VERS and over the years, a preoccupation of HDBs. It is also a chief concern of most property owners in Singapore.By 2017, there were nearly 960,000 flats sold, distributed over 26 HDB towns and estates across Singapore. The three largest HDB towns, by housing units sold, are Jurong West (71,119 units), Tampines (66,225 units) and Sengkang (64,905 units). These three towns were developed over different periods, in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990srespectively.For the over 110,000 flats built in the 1960s, which are mostly found in the housing estates of Queenstown, Bukit Merahand Toa Payoh, most are between 48 to 58 years old. The balance leases for the oldest flats built by HDB are about 47 yearsOwners of these older flats are understandably anxious about shorter leases and obsolescence caused by wear and tear; the two factors that could adversely affect the values of their flats. Where many see their homes asretirement nests\" andforms of wealth to supplement their financial needs in their older years, one can empathise with their anxieties.THEY ALSO WORRY ABOUT GHOST TOWNSA commentary on Channel NewsAsia highlighted the challenge of expiring leases posing an additional challenge of estates emptying out and decaying as neighbourhoods age.Some readers have asked, how likely is this scenario?Ang Mo Kio today town houses approximately 145,700 residents in over 50,000 HDB flats built mostly in the 1970s and 1980s. The oldest flats are 48 years old, and many more will cross the half-life in the lease cycle in 10 years.Ang Mo Kio is mainly made up of HDB flats that were built in a short span of 7 years in the late 1970s; and most of them have balanced leases of about 55 to 65 years.What will Ang Mo Kio town be like in 20 years? If there were no VERS, and residents start to move out en mass when leases are closer to expiry, we might find Ang Mo Kio hollowing out. Essential services, such as schools, hospitals, shopping centres, supermarkets, closing; and those left behind will face see their quality of life severely diminished.Indeed, we will see entire towns like Ang Mo Kio ending up as ghost towns.In many huge Western countries, where the land supply is abundant, it is not uncommon to see ghost towns emerge - caused by the abandonment of a functional centre by residents, because a huge company closes.From long abandoned but once vibrant mining towns like Kennecott in Alaska, to shuttered resort towns that saw falling visitor numbers like Salton City in California, many localities have fallen into despair and decay.Such forms of urban blight, are unlikely to happen in land-scarce Singapore, if relocation is tempered by constraints on housing supply, so there will always be some people living in older flats.However, as neighbourhoods age, many may choose to move out to newer towns or precincts. This is a very likely outcome, as younger Singaporeans get married and leave their homes to move to newer towns, leaving behind less vibrant, older towns with a heavily ageing population.MAINTAINING A STABLE HOUSING MARKETIn this context, the governments announced VERS not only gives older estates a new lease of life assuring at least some flat owners that their old HDB flats will not be left to depreciate to zero at the end of the lease term.VERS, more importantly, plays a stabilising role in keeping the overall housing stock in equilibrium in the long term.In the absence of VERS, redevelopment can only happen once these estates run their lease down and the blocks return to HDB.But consider this. When the leases of almost 250,000 flats built between 1971 and 1980 expire between 2070 and 2079, approximately 25 per cent of the housing stock will be removed from the market. In just nine years, this number is equivalent to about five Ang Mo Kio towns.If construction cannot keep up to replace the houses removed or demolished at the end of the leases, the supply shortfall could cause dis-equilibrium in the housing market triggering an upward housing price cycle.The large-scale depletion of the housing stock could put severe stress to the housing market. A flat today will cost a lot more. How will young couples afford them then?Even if population growth remains constant, and construction keeps up, this will mean construction resources will be taken up by the Government, crowding out private developments and transforming entire neighbourhoods into loud, noisy construction sites.In tackling this conundrum, VERS gives owners of flats aged 70 years and above the chance to vote collectively, as a precinct, to sell the tail-end of the leases of their flats back to HDB.With VERS, HDB could redevelop those blocks retrieved back from the home owners and rejuvenate entire housing precincts with new amenities and new concepts of living that match future needs of residents earlier than the scheduled lease depletion time.GOOD NEWS FOR NOWDepending on how residents votefor VERS, redevelopment of different precincts in a housing estate could be carried out sequentially, in phases, and avoid turning one entire housing estate like Ang Mo Kio into a massive construction site.Therefore, VERS is an important urban renewal tool that help smooth out inelastic housing supply cycle, and consequentially, prevent steep housing price shocks that could adversely affect the housing affordability of the future generation of Singaporean households.It should be good news for most, even as we await more news on its details.Sing Tien Foo is Deans Chair associate professor and director at the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies, National University of Singapore.

Unit sizes at his maiden project The Ladyhill spanned an average 2,300 to 2,400 sq ft, a decision he made in the belief that space is luxury. But demand for smaller luxury apartments has been on the up, he observed, mirroring the trend in cities like New York, London and Paris.Currently, small units at his other projects are all sold out, he said.Empty nesters here are looking to move on from older properties that require more maintenance, while young professionals outsource housekeeping to housekeepers rather than hire live-in help.The freehold Petit Jervois will also be its first Singapore project in three years, Mr Cheong said. SC Global scooped up the former Jervois Gardens condo in September 2017 in a S$72 million collective sale.SC Global, Far East Consortium International and New World Development had also clinched a Cuscaden Road Government Land Sales (GLS) site for S$410 million this year.Mr Cheong's firm is responsible for head-turning premium developments, like Martin No 38, Sculptura Ardmore and Thr3e Thre3 Robin.\"We are able to withstand the collateral damage (from cooling measures over the years),\" he said. \"People know we're quality at the end of the day. We've maintained our prices . . . Quality will withstand the test of time.\"Likewise, the most recent round of cooling measures will likely result in a \"knee-jerk\" effect in the short term, but ultimately, \"those people who want good quality accommodation, they are still there. There are still buyers, and we continue to sell.\" Albeit sometimes with a nudge from the developer.In 2016, SC Global launched a payment plan to help move unsold units at The Hilltops. Under that scheme involving 30 units at the Cairnhill development, buyers would be given a two-year option to purchase the units at a fixed price set back then, and receive a return of 10 per cent each year on the 20 per cent downpayment.Two years on, he said all the buyers under that scheme have executed the option to buy.\"It solved their anxiety about prices going down further and whether they would be able to sell their existing place,\" he said.Since delisting from the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 2013, the company has ventured abroad, such as by acquiring a resort site in Bali in 2012, and buying some freehold land in the ski resort town of Niseko, Japan last year. In end-2017, it also bought a 12-storey commercial building in Tokyo called Ginza 12. Mr Cheong told BT that markets like Japan and China, particularly Shanghai, are promising for acquiring prime real estate.He declined to reveal SC Global's revenue mix by geography, but \"spends 50 per cent of his effort and time\" on overseas projects. But he said Singapore will continue to be the company's main base."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

When Wu Zhi Wei, DP Architects group director for Asia, revisited the 8 St Thomas development late last year, he was worried about how it would look against a backdrop of newer condominiums that had sprouted up in the neighbourhood. After all, Wu had designed 8 St Thomas nine years ago but the 250-unit development was completed only in January 2018. The ultimate test came when listed Singapore developer Bukit Sembawang Estates previewed 8 St Thomas simultaneously in Hong Kong and Singapore over the weekend of Aug 25 and 26. So far, more than 20 units have been sold, according to the developer. About 70% of the buyers were from Singapore, and the remainder from Hong Kong. Based on caveats lodged, the average price achieved was $3,191 psf. Wus trepidation quickly turned to relief. When I heard the prices achieved, I thought, Wow, more than $3,000 psf! he says.

(Photo Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Even Bukit Sembawang says it was heartened by the response to the project. Prices averaging above $3,000 psf is encouraging in todays property market, says group CEO Ng Chee Seng. The average price achieved at 8 St Thomas has effectively set a new threshold for the St Thomas enclave. A high of $3,400 psf was achieved for an 807 sq ft, two-bedroom unit on the 31st floor that was sold on the first weekend of preview at 8 St Thomas. In 3Q2018, the Core Central Region (CCR) had the least new launches, and the launch of 8 St Thomas achieved a high median price of $3,226 psf, says Ong Teck Hui, JLL national director of research & consultancy, Among the different regions, CCR registered the highest increase of 1.2% for non-landed property, based on the URA 3Q2018 flash estimate, he adds. Prior to the preview of 8 St Thomas, the only time a unit in the St Thomas Walk neighbourhood crossed $3,000 psf was in 2011, when a 591 sq ft unit on the 31st floor of Skypark changed hands for $3,238 psf.

Bukit Sembawang had purchased the former Chez Bright Apartment in a collective sale for $54 million, or $625 psf per plot ratio, in 2006. Then, it bought the adjacent site the former Airview Towers condo, which occupied a 63,264 sq ft site in a collective sale for $202.17 million, or $1,038 psf ppr a year, in February 2007. Bukit Sembawangs intention was to amalgamate both sites to create a larger freehold, land area of 99,000 sq ft. The combined site would have a gross floor area of 291,166 sq ft, which would bring the average price to $880 psf ppr. One owner at the 100-unit Airview Towers objected, however, to the collective sale. He won a short-lived victory in March 2008 when the High Court ruled in his favour. A month later, the Court of Appeal overruled the High Courts decision in favour of the majority owners. By the time the collective sale of Airview Towers was completed, the global financial crisis had ended the property boom. In the initial design stage, most of the units at 8 St Thomas were large, with a mix of premium two- to four-bedroom units. It was in keeping with trends in the 2007 property boom, when housing demand in the prime districts was driven predominantly by foreign investors who favoured sizeable luxury apartments. This was before the global financial crisis, says Nicholas Mak, ZACD Group executive director. Petite sizes favoured In 2009, when DP Architects Wu came on board, housing demand had shifted towards smaller units that were more palatable in terms of absolute prices. Bukit Sembawang therefore wanted units at 8 St Thomas reconfigured to include compact one- and two-bedroom units.

Another 46% of the units are three- and four-bedroom apartments, in cluding four-bedroom dual-key units with sizes ranging from 1,141 to 1,755 sq ft. There are only two penthouses in the development: They have four bedrooms each and measure 2,422 and 2,659 sq ft respectively. Prices in the development start from $1.46 million for a one-bedroom unit; and $1.76 million for a compact two-bedroom unit. Premium two-bedroom units start from $2.5 million and three-bedroom units are $3.38 million. Four-bedroom units are priced from $5.4 million and those with dual-key configurations are upwards of $5.2 million. Meanwhile, penthouses start from $8.89 million. Value of prime, freehold sites doubles In retrospect, Bukit Sembawangs purchase price for the amalgamated site of $880 psf ppr at 8 St Thomas was not high, especially compared with the reserve prices of collective sale sites today. For instance, Grange Heights, which is also located on St Thomas Walk, was put up for collective sale on Sept 17 at a reserve price of $820 million, or $1,948 psf ppr. Colliers International is the marketing agent. Freehold sites in the River Valley area, for instance Pacific Mansion at River Close was sold at $1,987 psf ppr and Grange Heights at St Thomas Walk has an asking price of $1,948 psf ppr (Picture Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Nearby, at River Valley Close, the freehold Pacific Mansion was sold in March this year to a joint venture between GuocoLand Singapore and Hong Leong Group for $980 million in what is considered the years biggest collective sale. Based on the gross floor area of 493,222 sq ft, the purchase price for the land works out to $1,987 psf ppr. With land prices in prime District 9 at close to $2,000 psf ppr, ZACDs Mak estimates the break-even price for the new projects to be around $2,800 psf and selling prices from $3,100 psf. Thats assuming a 10% profit margin, he adds. With the latest round of property cooling measures, developers will have to build more compact apartments to sell their projects within a five-year time frame so as not to incur higher additional buyers stamp duty. Bukit Sembawangs Ng acknowledges that properties with freehold tenure are very limited in supply. 8 St Thomas is located in prime District 9, which is a sought-after address, he adds. Given that 8 St Thomas is completed, homeowners can move in immediately or rent out the units (Photo Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) The attributes that buyers seek in prime developments remain relatively unchanged over time. According to Ng, most desire a large plot that offers lush landscaping and full condo facilities. Accessibility is also key, and 8 St Thomas is within walking distance of two MRT stations Somerset and the upcoming Great World. Having a wide range of units that are functional and spacious as well as with great views are also key attributes, he adds. Given that the project is newly completed, homeowners can move in immediately or rent out the units. For buyers, 8 St Thomas is seen as a good, long-term investment with potential for capital appreciation, adds Ng. Capturing views Even though the design was conceived nine years ago, it is still relevant today. The faade of the two towers at 8 St Thomas are streamlined and sleek, while the balconies of the units designed to look like drawers that have been pulled out (Photo Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) DP Architects Wu wanted to create a sense of art and an identity for 8 St Thomas. The faade of the two towers is streamlined and sleek, while the balconies of the units were designed to look like drawers that have been pulled out. Says Wu: The balconies are an extension of the apartments to bring residents closer to nature, the outdoors. The idea was to capitalise on the location as well as the views from the lofty height of more than 150m. As such, the two towers are pushed to the edges of the site. From one of the towers, high-floor units will be able to enjoy views of the Istana and the Singapore River. From the second tower, high-floor units will have views of the city and Marina Bay Sands. To maximise views, many units come with bay windows and corner windows. The height of the bay windows at 8 St Thomas is just 0.5m above the floor instead of 1m. They can therefore be turned into seating or display areas without compromising the views, points out Wu. These days, you hardly see bay windows in new developments, which is a pity. They do serve a purpose bay windows make a small room feel spacious. The master bathroom of a three-bedroom unit with corner windows (Photo Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Social, communal spaces A total of 11 sky terraces was incorporated into the two towers: six in one tower and five in the other. Each sky terrace has a triple-height ceiling and, besides greenery, they introduce pockets of social and communal spaces in the development. Most new developments sacrifice social and communal spaces in favour of more saleable area, says Wu. At 8 St Thomas, however, the developer has offered owners more social and communal spaces at the sky terraces situated at intermittent levels for social gatherings, lounging and reading. The high-floor sky terraces come with dining facilities, and look out to greenery, the landscape or the skyline. The landscaped deck acts as a soft barrier to separate the development from the main street and neighbouring developments, says Wu. The high-floor sky terraces come with dining facilities, and look out to greenery, the landscape or the skyline (Photo Credit The Mondrian spirit His design for 8 St Thomas was inspired by his favourite artist, Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. Regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, Mondrian championed abstract style and favoured simple geometric elements. Wu hopes that by invoking the Mondrian spirit, his design for 8 St Thomas will stand the test of time."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

He adds: You never know whats around each corner and just when you think the ride is smooth, there is a sharp curve or stomach-twisting loop when you least expect it! This was despite the mental preparation since August last year when it was announced that he would be taking over as CEO from Jan 1, 2018. He had even come up with a roadmap to hit the ground running. Kwek: Change is something that people are very resistant to and many would rather stay in their comfort zone (Credit: CDL) On Oct 3, CDL won in the Top Developer category at the EdgeProp Singapore Excellence Awards 2018. As a third-generation chief of a sprawling real estate business with an illustrious history spanning more than 55 years and a market capitalisation of close to $9 billion, the 42-year-old Kwek is determined to prove himself. We cannot rest on our laurels, he says. A lot needs to be done, especially in this day and age of disruption and innovation. We must constantly strengthen, transform and even re- invent ourselves to stay relevant. At the start of his tenure in January, Kwek declared to the entire organisation his manifesto: A journey of renewal and transformation. He even crafted a three-pronged strategy with the acronym GET: Growth, Enhancement and Transformation. CDLs Singapore corporate office has 392 staff today, according to the companys 2018 integrated sustainability report. As a company becomes bigger in size, there are bound to be some growing pains, Kwek admits. These three elements good teamwork, execution and innovation start to really suffer. Consistent with human nature, change is something that people are very resistant to and many would rather stay in their comfort zone, hence stifling the innovation that is urgently required in the face of such rapid evolution and disruption. Replenishing landbank Artist's impression of the upcoming commercial and residential project site at Sengkang Central that CDL and CapitaLand had won in August this year (Credit: CapitaLand) Kwek intends to grow the groups existing property development and asset management businesses. We were almost out of landbank last year and I made it my priority to strategically replenish our landbank, especially in our domestic market, he says. Last year, CDL acquired two land parcels for $1.28 billion: A site on Tampines Avenue 10 was purchased in a government land ten- der in April; and Amber Park in an en bloc deal in October. This year, four sites were purchased in government land tenders for a total of $1.97 billion. The first two sites on Handy Road and West Coast Vale were acquired at end-January. An executive condominium (EC) site on Sumang Walk in Punggol was purchased in February and a mixed-use commercial and residential site at Sengkang Central was jointly purchased with CapitaLand in August. According to Kwek, the sites will provide a pipeline of around 3,300 units for the next few years. The figure excludes the 861-unit The Tapestry at Tampines, which has already been launched. However, it includes the 190 units at South Beach Residences, which was soft- launched last month; and Boulevard 88, a mixed- use development with 154 residential units and 204 hotel rooms that has yet to be launched. For the Singapore residential market, we tried to be strategic in our land acquisitions and put in place a diversified landbank that caters for all segments of the market, including ECs and mass-market, mid-tier and high- end offerings, says Kwek. The sites are also spread across different regions from the East to Central and the West. We have been very selective and see great potential in our sites, which have excel- lent locational attributes, notes Kwek. For instance, the Sengkang Central site that CDL and CapitaLand jointly acquired is adjacent to the Buangkok MRT station. Overseas investments, recurring income CDL acquired Aldgate House, an office building with 210,000 sq ft of net lettable area in London for $328.5 million last month (Credit: CDL) CDL embarked on an overseas diversification strategy in 2010, starting with China, followed by the UK in 2013, Japan a year later and Australia in 2015. We will continue to boost our presence in these markets and look at new markets with strong potential, says Kwek. Beyond the hotels under its subsidiary Millennium & Copthorne, CDL has also accelerated its acquisition of properties with recurring income. In China, CDL acquired a 32,000 sq m (344,400 sq ft) office project now called Hong Leong Plaza in Shanghais Huangqiao district for RMB890 million in February 2017. This year, CDL acquired another prime office building in the Yaojiang International complex in Shanghai for RMB148 million ($29.6 million). In Suzhou, it opened the Hong Leong City Centre mall in June 2018. In the UK, CDL acquired Aldgate House, an office building with 210,000 sq ft of net lettable area in London for $328.5 million last month. In 2016, CDL had purchased the prime freehold, 28,0000 sq ft Development House office building in Shoreditch. The site has obtained planning approval for redevelopment into a nine-storey building of over 72,000 sq ft in NLA. A third office acquisition in London is underway. In the past, we had been too dependent on our development income, which is prone to big fluctuations, Kwek explains. Its time to really build up our recurring income now. Asset and fund management Distrii has opened a 62,000 sq ft co-working space in Republic Plaza which is currently undergoing a $70 million asset enhancement exercise (Credit: CDL) As part of his enhancement strategy, a new asset management structure has been put in place, led by Yvonne Ong, who took on the role of CEO of commercial and head of CDLs asset management division in June this year. The group had closed the original 97-apartment Le Grove Serviced Residence. After a $30 million refurbishment, the property opened in mid-July with 173 apartments. CDL is in the midst of a $70 million asset enhancement exercise for its flagship Republic Plaza office tower that is on track to be completed by 2H2019. It includes revamping the main lobby and lift lobbies, adding restrooms and upgrading the existing ones. The retail space will be enhanced to provide better pedestrian flow and visibility, with new mechanical and electrical installation to facilitate more F&B offerings. Plans are underway to create a new retail cluster at Level 2 of Republic Plaza through conversion of some of the existing car-park spaces. The group will continue to review its asset portfolio and find ways to enhance, reposition or redevelop the properties to drive greater value, says Kwek. As part of CDLs transformation, he wants to create a more sustainable business model. Towards that end, new divisions ranging from fund management, venture capital and innovation were set up. An Enterprise Innovation Committee comprising our youngest and brightest staff has been created to focus on finding ways to deliver a superior and unique experience to customers, he adds. Property cooling measures the biggest market disruptor The crowd at the launch of The Tapestry in March where to date, 530 out of 550 units have been sold (Credit: Property Agent) While CDL has made some headway in implementing its plans, the property industry was derailed by the unexpected slew of property cooling measures announced on July 5. The measures disrupted sentiment in the property market while capital markets continue to reel from macroeconomic concerns, including global trade tensions, rising interest rates and currency crises, observes Kwek. Many industry players consider the recent cooling measures particularly harsh. The governments strong intervention at such an early stage [of] the recovery cycle was very unexpected, Kwek says. Prices may have gone up 9.1% over four quarters starting from 2Q2017, but they fell close to 12% over 15 consecutive quarters before the recent rise. The hike in additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD), coupled with the implementation of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework in 2013, had already taken their toll on the property market from 2H2013 to 1H2017. The [TDSR] was not an easy pill for the market to swallow and one would have assumed that it was effective in keeping overall house- hold debt in check, says Kwek. Leverage, however, continues to be an issue. Aside from significantly hiking the ABSD, the recent cooling measures also reduced the loan-to-value ratio across the board for all purchasers, including first-time homebuyers, Kwek observes. ABSD for developers was increased from 15% to 25% from July. On top of that, developers have to pay 5% ABSD upfront when acquiring land, and that amount is non-remit- table. Yet, the five-year time frame to develop and sell all the units remains. View from one of the sky terraces at New Futura (Credit: CDL) In the 12 months leading up to the measures in July, land prices soared to dizzying heights and put significant pressure on developers bidding for land, observes Kwek. In turn, these high land prices translate into escalating housing prices, which are not desirable for [buyers] and pose a significant concern for the government as prices run ahead of economic fundamentals. However, if you trace the problem to its source, part of the issue stems from the ABSD measure, which heavily penalises developers if they do not complete construction and fully sell every single unit within a period of five years from land acquisition. Developers forced through a narrow funnel While the intention is to prevent developers from hoarding land, Kwek says an unintended consequence is that all developers are forced through a narrow funnel to build and sell in a short timeframe. As a result, developers are prevented from timing their launches. Even when market sentiment is depressed, they have no choice but to start sales for new projects, Kwek says. They end up developing, selling and handing over units within a similar time frame, causing many of them to run out of land at around the same time. Kwek observes that developers without land- banks are unlikely to be in business for long. It is no wonder that developers who are in ur- gent need of land replacement have had to bid ferociously to obtain new land, be it via government land sales or private en bloc treaties. Kwek understands the rationale behind the ABSD: to caution developers and buyers as well as moderate land prices by attaching hefty penalties for unsold units. Unfortunately, the fear of running out of raw materials, or land, ultimately outweighs the fear of penalties and this causes developers to bid aggressively for land, he adds. This can cause land prices to spiral to unsustainable levels, something which developers also do not want to see happen. I am not saying that the five-year ABSD restriction is the only reason for high land prices, but it is certainly a significant contributing factor. South Beach Residences saw 10 units sold, including the super penthouse for $26 million (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Luxury segment worst hit The recent measures will hit the luxury residential segment the hardest, reckons Kwek. We saw a slower take-up rate at our South Beach Residences soft launch than would otherwise be the case, he says. It was reported that South Beach Residences sold about 10 units at private previews last month, including the super penthouse, for $26 million ($3,864 psf). For New Futura, Kwek says, We are fortunate to have launched the project in January and are now over 80% sold. Even after the recent measures came into effect, New Futura has continued to see strong sales, and maintained its average selling price of above $3,500 psf for the second phase. Kwek attributes this to the ultra-luxurious and unique product that we have created. The project picked up the Top Development award at the EdgeProp Singapore Excellence Awards on Oct 3. The developments iconic design and free- hold nature likely swayed many buyers into accepting the onerous ABSD implications. However, it is unlikely that we will see this happening across the board for other luxury developments, Kwek points out. The mass- to mid-market segments have seen a slowdown in sales volume too since the property cooling measures came into effect. But high-quality, well-located projects such as The Tapestry will still be able to maintain a steady stream of sales, says Kwek. The buyers of these projects tend to be mostly Singapore citizens and permanent residents purchasing their first property, so the majority are unaffected by the ABSD ruling, although some may struggle, owing to the reduced loan quantum. According to caveats lodged as at Oct 8, 530 out of 550 units launched in March at the 861- unit The Tapestry had been sold, at an average price of $1,531 psf. New Futura is more than 80% sold since it was launched in January (Credit: CDL) New launches CDL is planning to launch Whistler Grand, its new project on the site of West Coast Vale, before year-end. It will have 716 residential units and two shops. Kwek reckons demand for Whistler Grand will be good because of the upcoming Jurong Lake District, which is being positioned as the second CBD. Most of the other new projects in the West Coast area are almost fully sold, he says. Buyers of mass- and mid-market projects are largely first-time homebuyers. In early May, CSC Land launched the 520- unit Twin Vew, located just across the street from the upcoming Whistler Grand. So far, 453 units (87%) of the project have been sold, at an average price of $1,382 psf, according to caveats lodged. On the weekend of Oct 6 and 7, Teddington Riverside was launched in Singapore. The London project occupies the site of the former Teddington Studios, a big UK television studio. CDL had purchased the site in November 2015 for 158 million. The new development at Teddington Riverside will have 240 units four blocks of 217 apartments, six townhouses, two duplex apartments and 15 affordable housing units occupying a 196,022 sq ft site. Prices start from 670,000 ($1.2 million) for a one-bedroom unit, 980,000 for a two-bedroom unit and 1.63 million for a three-bedroom unit. Teddington Riverside will be launched in UK as well as in road shows in Singapore, Hong Kong and China (Credit: CDL) Prior to our launch [of Teddington Riverside] this month, we had received encouraging levels of enquiries, says Kwek. Having said that, its a very difficult time for the residential market in the UK, which has suffered greatly from the uncertainty surrounding the whole Brexit process. Aside from the UK and the roadshow in Singapore recently, with Strawberry Star as the marketing agent, CDL intends to hold roadshows in Hong Kong and mainland China as well. Investing in start-ups, diversification Besides property development, asset management and fund management, CDL intends to invest in start-ups that complement its core real estate and hospitality businesses. Investments so far include a 20% stake in mamahome, a Shanghai-based online residential rental plat- form, and a 24% stake in co-working platform Distrii. In July, CDL invested HK$237.81 mil- lion ($42.1 million) to become a cornerstone investor in the IPO of E-House, a China-based home services provider. According to Kwek, E-House has an ex- tensive network of more than 17,000 property agents in China. It can be very beneficial for our residential sales in China, Singapore and other investment destinations, he says. On top of that, E-House has a deep and ro- bust database. Mamahome has 230,000 apartment listings across 30 cities in China and entered Singapore this year. It is building up a tremendous rental platform that our own rental properties can also benefit from, Kwek says. CDL invested 24% in Distrii last year. Pictured here is Distrii's flagship and largest co-working facility at Suhe Center in Jing'an, Shanghai (Credit: CDL) On Distrii, he says it has achieved significant scale and now has 34 co-working locations in China and one in Republic Plaza in Singapore. The 62,000 sq ft co-working space at Republic Plaza, which opened in mid-May, is now 80%-occupied. Kwek hopes to turn CDL into a more diversified property group with greater stability in earnings and wider diversification. He adds: Had we just remained in one or two asset classes and focused solely on our domestic market, we would have suffered greatly during the extremely depressed years in Singapores residential market from 2014 to 2017. During those difficult years, our results were greatly bolstered by our overseas sales as our diversification efforts bore fruit, especially in China. Singapore will, however, remain CDLs core focus. After five decades, we are very familiar with the local market and we have contributed much to the skyline here, he says."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Hotels and other tourism infrastructure for Mice (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions)-related activities are among the possibilities, he said. The growing cruise industry may also play a part, and there is scope for the Marina Bay Cruise Centre to be developed further, Mr Chee said. As for Sentosa, he said it must be \"well-integrated with what we're going to do on the main island of Singapore\". He said areas being studied include improving the island's connectivity and attractiveness, for example by rejuvenating existing infrastructure and facilities as well as bringing in new attractions. \"One area which I am personally very keen to see how we can explore and push ahead is how we can encourage more activities at night on Sentosa,\" Mr Chee said, adding that the cooler weather would be conducive to organising events and activities that can attract Singaporeans. In his speech at the opening of the three-day conference and exhibition at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Mr Chee said the Government's overall tourism strategy includes investing in quality attractions and reinventing Singapore's offerings.For example, Orchard Road, the subject of an ongoing study to come up with measures to rejuvenate the precinct, can be more than Singapore's main shopping belt, he said.It can be a \"green oasis in the city centre\", and an innovation district where firms including start-ups and social entrepreneurs can test new ideas, said Mr Chee, who is also Senior Minister of State for Education.\"We want to create that buzz, that dynamism and from there you will attract footfall. And with footfall you will be able to support the businesses there,\" he said. More details on the plans for both Sentosa and Orchard Road will be made known in six to nine months, he told the media.In his speech, Mr Chee also mentioned that a streamlined procedure and online portal for tourist guide licence applications will be launched in the second quarter of next year.The ITB Asia trade show, which is expected to draw more than 11,000 visitors over three days, features a Muslim Travel Pavilion for the first time, to share insights into the growing market.

Another 200 units have been sold since then, bringing the total to more than 500. The first phase, or 60% of the 805-unit development, is now fully sold. From July to September,Park Colonialwas the top-selling project in the city-fringe area, or Rest of Central Region (RCR), according to Cushman & Wakefield. This was achieved against a backdrop of higher additional buyers stamp duty and lower borrowing limit for mortgages that were part of the latest property cooling measures. The crowd on the first weekend of previews atPark Colonial, where the first phase, or 60%, of the 805-unit development has been sold WELL-LOCATED The property cooling measures have forced homebuyers to be more circumspect about selecting the right property before committing to a purchase, says Alvin Tan, executive director and head of project marketing at PropNex International. Besides price, they look at potential capital appreciation due to future development, as well as potential rentability of the unit post-completion. Park Colonialoutperformed other recent launches because it possesses many of the attributes that homebuyers seek, adds Tan. One major attribute is its location: The project is adjacent to the Woodleigh MRT station and across the road from the Stamford American International School. Across the road is the upcoming Woodleigh Mall with more than 300,000 sq ft of retail space and the future township, Bidadari Estate, adds Tan. Thus, Park Colonial enjoys the best of both worlds situated in a private residential enclave, yet able to enjoy the amenities of an up-and-coming masterplanned township. Colonial Square COMPETITIVELY PRICED At prices averaging $1,700 to $1,800 psf,Park Colonialis competitively priced relative to other projects in the RCR, says Eugene Lim, key executive officer of ERA Realty Network. The upcoming Woodleigh Mall at the MRT station and future development of Bidadari estate will spell capital appreciation over the long term, he notes. The developer, CEL Unique Development, is a consortium comprising Chip Eng Seng Corps property development arm CEL Development, Heeton Holdings and KSH Holdings English Breakfast House atPark Colonial STANDOUT PROJECT A development inspired by the blackand- white bungalows located in the picturesque and serene Woodleigh Park,Park Colonialwas designed by multiple-award winning ADDP Architects.

When MEGA@Woodlands opened its doors in the first half of the year, the facility illustrated the upheavals in Singapores rapidly changing industrial property landscape. The new facility in Woodlands features a gym with shower facilities, as well as a dedicated business centre with several meeting and conference rooms of different capacities. The gym will be comprehensively equipped with cardiovascular equipment and free weights; it also offers a complimentary shower. The facility also boasts a jogging trail and a park connector, together with landscaped pavilions.Out with the old, in with the newAcross Singapore, industrial property developers are realising that integrating the latest technology and amenities into their properties are crucial to retain and attract tenants. Industrial spaces that are older and further away from transportation nodes tend to face greater difficulty in retaining tenants as they may be physically obsolete. Additionally, industrial buildings that do not support the national move towards Industry 4.0; may also be faced with challenges, says Ong Choon Fah, CEO of Edmund Tie & Company (ET&Co).The industrial environment has changed over time and will continue to change in the future. As a result, real estate will also have to incorporate such changes to suit the needs of industrialists. In particular, the growth of urban logistics will be a sector that has high growth potential as e-commerce grows exponentially, Ong adds.Developers are rejuvenating their properties in anticipation of the demand from newer industries. For instance, AA REIT recently revealed a $13m makeover for NorthTech, its four-storey light industrial building in Woodlands. The project is part of the REITs numerous asset enhancement initiatives launched over the past few years, which includes the redevelopment of 30 Tuas West Road and 20 Gul Way.As firms increasingly adopt Industry 4.0 initiatives such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things (IoT), automation and robotics, we expect demand for higher specification industrial facilities that can accommodate these requirements such as higher power and floor loading capacity to grow. The governments move to push Singapore up the value-add and value-creation chain e.g. R&D is also expected to contribute to the demand for such higher specification facilities, such as business parks, explains Adrian Toh, Director, Industrial Sales and Leasing, JLL Singapore.Also read: Spaces for business parks could double by 2030Brenda Ong, Executive Director of Industrial & Logistics Services at CBRE, notes that highly sought-after industrial properties include ramp-up logistics developments, factories with high power and cooling capacities and integrated industrial developments by JTC. With the ongoing industry transformation in Singapore, we see more tenants and end users moving towards smart logistics facilities which can cater to their need for efficient inventory management and higher operational efficiency. We also see more interest for sites with longer tenures as it justifies the high initial fixed capital outlay, she says.Toh warns that changes to Singapores manufacturing landscape had rendered some of the older facilities with outdated building specifications functionally obsolete. At the same time, JTCs stringent subletting and lease assignment rules, as well as anchor tenant requirements has made it more challenging for third-party facility providers such as developers and REITs, he says.A millennial twistApart from high-tech spaces, industrial tenants are also on the lookout for amenities which will help them boost operations as well as attract and retain talent. Newer industrial spaces that cater to the changing needs of industrialists as they transform and improve their manufacturing processes are also highly demanded. Industrial spaces now include many additional facilities, such as a gym or childcare facilities to attract talent and cater to the changing business environment of industrialists, says ET&Cos Ong. She adds that more information technology and media companies may choose to locate in newer business park developments which offer a wide variety of facilities such as day care and fitness centres.Moreover, a government survey in 2017 showed that there were 470 child care centres located in workplaces, such as commercial premises, government buildings and industrial estates. Amongst is Sherwood Childcare, which caters to the busy parents working at JTCs bustling high-tech industry in Ayer Rajah. First built in the 1980s, Sherwood Childcare now serves the needs of parents from surrounding neighbourhoods such as Clementi, Dover, and Bouna Vista, just to name a few.Also read:Industrial property sales skyrocketed 295.1% to $794.4m in Q2The trend of creating livable industrial spaces is also reflected in JTCs ongoing projects, such as the Jurong Innovation District and the Punggol Digital District. The Jurong Innovation District is a next-generation development that will host smart factories, provide new platforms for innovation, and facilitate cross-industry collaboration. The district will also be a living lab where the latest ideas and technologies will be test-bedded and deployed; catalysing new, cutting edge industry clusters and providing a platform for creation and discovery.Meanwhile, the Punggol Digital District will be a vibrant mixed-use business district which is integrated with the new Singapore Institute of Technology campus. Housing key growth industries such as digital and cyber security, PDD aims to foster strong collaborations between industry and academia, as well as facilitate test-bedding and prototyping of new innovations. The district will feature green links to the waterfront, as well as public spaces for the community to gather and enjoy, providing an attractive work-live-learn-play environment.Another trend which is fast becoming the norm is consolidation and rationalisation. The servicisation of the manufacturing industry is increasing the need for more flexible industrial space. In the longer term, the blurring of lines between manufacturing and services would lead to the demand for more flexible use of industrial space, explains JLLs Toh.Recognising this, JTC is test-bedding a multi-tenanted building on a site zoned Business 1-White in Woodlands to support manufacturing companies in co-locating their service-driven activities such as R&D and after-sales support alongside their manufacturing operations. It is understood that a wider range of uses will be allowed, he adds.Under this pilot scheme, the JTC will allow a wider range of uses will be within the property, including industrial-related uses that are closely linked to or provide critical support for the industrial sector. For example, engineering and industrial design activities that are currently not allowed in an industrial development would be allowed in the Woodlands pilot development, given that these activities play a key role in the manufacturing value chain. However, clear-cut commercial and other non-industrial activities will continue to be disallowed within the Business 1 component.Also read:New supply of industrial space hit 3.24 million sq ft in H1We recognise that business structures and needs are evolving. More manufacturing companies are shifting their business models from production-led to service-driven activities, or agglomerating their functions across value chains some are growing their R&D, prototyping, sales/after-sales and other services-type activities, and do so alongside their core manufacturing activities so that all functions across their product development cycle are well-integrated, the JTC said in a statement.Another example is the upcoming Trendspace, which will be Singapores first high-rise multi-tenant development for furniture and furniture-related companies. The clustering of furniture-related stakeholders at Sungei Kadut will allow furniture companies to benefit from resource-sharing arrangements and potential collaborations. As part of the Singapore Furniture Industries Councils (SFIC) Experience Centre in the building, the development will also feature export showrooms, a training institute, co-working spaces and an atrium space for industry-related events and exhibitions, says ET&Cos Ong.Trendspace is made up of large modular factory units. It is located in Sungei Kadut, a region that is well-known as an industrial estate for furniture-related companies. Developed by the JTC, Trendspace will allow companies to share resources, reduce wastage and add value towards each others business. Meanwhile, Hong Kong-listed WuXi Biologics, a leading global open-access biologics technology platform company offering end-to-end solutions for biologics discovery, development and manufacturing, will invest $80m and hire approximately 150 employees to establish a state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Singapore. The new manufacturing facility, supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, is the companys first overseas site in Asia and second site outside of China.Win some, lose someThe industrial property market will continue to grapple with increased supply and soft investor sentiment. However, there are some bright spots which will lead the sector in coming months.Apart from high-specification properties, industrial buildings approved for food handling are also among the sectors biggest winners, says Alan Cheong, senior director at Savills Singapore. These spaces are located within the food zones. The push by the authorities to up productivity levels in the Food and Beverage sector (F&B) is shifting food preparation activities from on-site to offsite Central Kitchens. These Central Kitchens are now in hot demand by both large F&B operators for in-house food preparation and set-ups that purvey either a general or bespoke product to a myriad of F&B customers, he says.In fact, data from Savills show that rents for industrial properties with such approved use are firm and, depending on location, can range from $2.50 per sq ft to $3.50 per sq ft per month, much higher than the average $1.14 per sq ft per month recorded for general industrial space. The market is not all doom and gloom with a narrow spectrum of bullishness found in the food preparation sector, Cheong noted. Sought-after industrial properties include ramp-up logistics developments, factories with high power and cooling capacities and integrated industrial developments by JTC. Integrated industrial developments encourage companies to co-locate, which will lower operating costs and boost productivity, CBREs Ong says.We have also observed a growing interest of e-commerce players for integrated logistics facilities that will increase efficiency, reduce costs and enhance flexibility. Such facilities could offer storage solutions, automated sorting and last-mile services such as self-collection and delivery all under one roof, she adds.Photo from Commercial Guru"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Both sites come under the Confirmed List of the second half 2018 Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme.The Kampong Java Road plot spans 11,643.3 sq m, with a maximum gross floor area (GFA) of 32,602 sq m, and can house 435 units. Schools such as Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) and Etonhouse Pre-School (Newton) are located nearby, as is Newton Food Centre.This site would be \"a litmus test\" of the market given the revised unit size regulations, said Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore at Colliers International, who estimates a $2,100 psf (per square foot) average selling price, and a land bid of $1,350 psf ppr (per square foot per plot ratio) or $470 million. \"Response to the Kampong Java site could provide an indication of developers' confidence in the high-end home market after a spate of collective sales in the area and the recent announcement on revised unit size guidelines,\" she added.The site is located just outside the central area and therefore should be subject to an average unit size of 85 sq m, she said.Nicholas Mak, executive director at ZACD Group, said that the Kampong Java Road would likely attract \"healthy interest\" due to its prime location, though he pitted the reasonable top bid at $421 million to $456 million, or $1,200 to $1,300 psf ppr due to the cooling measures.\"Although this site is located in District 9, it is outside the areas with the stricter development regulation regarding unit sizes,\" he said. \"Hence it is not subject to the new average minimum unit size of 100 sq m. This would enhance its attraction to some developers.\"The Tampines Avenue 10 EC site spans 24,938.7 sq m, with a maximum GFA of 69,829 sq m. About 695 units can be built on the site, but the number of dwelling units is capped at 700.Analysts believe the EC site would be hotly contested given the short supply in the market and competitive bidding for the EC sites seen this year. Tenders for Anchorvale Crescent and Canberra Link in September saw seven and nine bids, with the top bids coming in at $576 and $558 psf ppr respectively.Huttons Asia's Lee Sze Teck said: \"Tampines is the first regional centre in Singapore and a sought after place to live in. The parcel sits in a mature estate with plenty of amenities like Our Tampines Hub, connectivity options like Tampines Downtown line and green spaces like Bedok Reservoir.\"Colliers' Ms Song said: \"The new minimum average unit size of 85 sq m should also have minimum impact for ECs as ECs are targeted at families in the first place and the average unit size suggested by the development cap of 700 units is well above the 85 sq m.\"She expects seven to nine bidders and a top land bid of $560 psf ppr or $420 million. ZACD's Mr Mak thinks the reasonable top bid in the tender for this site could range from $398 million to $428 million, or $530 to $570 psf ppr.\"However, it would not be surprising if a developer were to submit a very bullish bid, surpassing $430 million,\" he said.Both sites have 99-year leases. Their tenders will close on Jan 15, 2019.A third land parcel is a white site in Marina View at Marina Bay which is slated for a mixed-use development. It can yield 905 residential units and 540 hotel rooms. A \"white\" site is a land parcel where a range of uses are allowed, although the government is likely to stipulate a minimum component of a specific use or specific uses to meet its planning intentions.The site is available for application under the Reserve List, which means developers can trigger its tender if they indicate interest with bid commitments acceptable to the URA.The Marina Bay site comprises two plots - the 7,817.6 sq m land parcel, and a subterranean stratum 18 sq m in size. In all, the site has a maximum GFA of 101,629 sq m. A minimum 51,000 sq m is slated for residential use, with 26,000 sq m for hotel rooms and hotel-related uses. There is a maximum 2,000 sq m allowable for optional office use and another maximum 2,000 sq m for commercial use.\"We expect this site to offer an attractive proposition to developers with hotel interests or developers with varying interests can form a joint venture,\" said Ms Song of Colliers. \"Given the numerous permutations of the final product, we estimate the top bid could range from $1,380 to 1,600 psf ppr or $1.5 to 1.75 billion.\"Mr Mak said the tender could attract about four to eight bids, or with reasonable bids coming in at $1.56 billion to $1.75 billion, or $1,426 to $1,600 psf ppr.A white site at Central Boulevard was sold in November 2016 to an IOI Properties joint venture. Its top bid came in at $2.57 billion, or $1,689 psf ppr. It was announced this year that IOI Properties has removed Hongkong Land as joint venture partner and will develop it alone.The Marina View site's \"close proximity to prestigious developments such as Asia Square and Marina One makes it an attractive location for a distinctive mixed use development,\" the URA said on its website. \"The future development will also offer city living opportunities and enhance the vibrancy in the area.\"Marina Bay and Downtown MRT stations as well as the upcoming Shenton Way Thomson-East Coast Line MRT station are close by."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The development is slated for completion by the end of August 2022.Jointly developed by Kajima Development and Singapore Press Holdings, The Woodleigh Residences comprises two-, three-and four-bedroom units starting at $1,873 per sq ft.A two-bedroom apartment has a starting price of $1.088 million, while a four-bedroom unit is priced at $2.55 million onwards.Arranged in a U-shape to maximise window views for the various units, the 99-year leasehold property affords views of Bidadari Park and Alkaff Lake. Residents will also have the use of an onsen, a Japanese-style hot spring.Mr Bob Tay, 43, an engineer, said the central location of the property drew him to look for an apartment. He has two children, aged 8 and 11.\"It's near the shopping centre and MRT station. Now I live in Geylang, which is less central compared to this location,\" he said.Mr Vincent Ng, 42, an architect with three boys aged two to six, said the schools in the area made him interested in the property.OrangeTee & Tie managing director Steven Tan said: \"People buy this property for themselves or their families because it is so conveniently located. It's near the MRT station, malls, food centres and schools. People are also willing to pay a premium to get units with a good view. They're concerned about the environment they live in and want a place close to nature.\"He added that despite measures instituted by the Government in July this year to cool the private residential market, people are buying properties to upgrade from public housing and enjoy the facilities of a condominium.OrangeTee & Tie and Savills Singapore are the marketing agents for The Woodleigh Residences. The property's sales gallery will close from Nov 19, in preparation for its official launch in early 2019.Soft-launch prices will continue to be offered to members of the public who are keen to make a purchase before Nov 19.Upcoming sales launches include Parc Esta at Sims Avenue next weekend.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

This is an owners sale and the property has an indicative price of $2.25 million ($1,699 psf). The fourth-floor unit was first put up for auction on Nov 14 at a higher price of $2.28 million ($1,722 psf). As there were no bids then, it was withdrawn. VisionCrest is a freehold mixeduse development by Wing Tai Holdings, and was completed in 2007. The 265-unit development comprises four residential blocks of up to 14 storeys. VisionCrest Commercial, a 12-storey office block, is adjacent to the residential blocks. The unit types at VisionCrest range from studios of up to 947 sq ft, to two-bedroom units of up to 1,356 sq ft, as well as three-bedroom units of up to 1,475 sq ft and penthouses of up to 2,131 sq ft. The owners, a Singaporean couple, purchased the unit as investment for $2.359 million ($1,782 psf) in July 2007, when it was newly launched. According to Sharon Lee, senior director and head of auction and sales at Knight Frank, the couple has never stayed in the unit. Instead, it has always been rented out, and is currently tenanted to an Australian expatriate who has stayed there for a couple of years, says Lee. The unit can be sold with either vacant possession or an existing tenancy agreement. The unit comes with a private balcony, which Lee says the tenant likes to use for barbecue nights. The master bedroom comes with an en-suite bathroom. There is also a separate bathroom. The draw of this unit is the location, Lee notes. Both Somerset and Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations on the North-South Line are an eight-minute walk away.

According to Gwen Lim, senior manager with the residential prime sales team at Knight Frank, the owners are a retired couple who wish to sell off their unit. They are downsizing, as age is catching up with them and they find the apartment a bit too big to manage, she says. The couple bought the property when Tang lin View received its Temporary Occupation Permit in 2001. Lim describes the unit as a rare find, as similar-sized units in the development are seldom put on the market. It overlooks the prime Good Class Bungalow (GCB) estate in the Chatsworth, Bishopsgate and Rochalie Drive neighbourhood. This means future owners are unlikely to have their views obstructed by new high-rises. The 99-year leasehold property is on a high floor and therefore has unobstructed views. The apartment contains four bedrooms and a study. As the unit faces northeast, there will be a bit of sunlight coming in in the morning, says Lim. The kitchen has been newly renovated and installed with Miele appliances; the bathroom is fitted with a Jacuzzi by Hansgrohe and a rain-shower panel. The living and dining area overlooks the GCB neighbourhood (Credit: Knight Frank Singapore) Tanglin View is in a central location, near amenities and the city centre. The development is a nine-minute walk to Redhill MRT station on the East-West line, and a seven-minute drive to the Orchard Road shopping belt.

Rate it between -1 to 1, whether the text is suggesting a boom or bust in the industrial properties market. Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "A look at some unexpected consequences in the property market.FollowIT used to be that properties in Good Class Bungalow (GCB) Areas - the most prestigious form of landed housing in Singapore - were bought by Singapore's captains of industry, tycoons and well-heeled foreigners turned Singaporeans.In recent years, however, Singaporeans in their twenties have also been surfacing among buyers of these big-ticket properties, as property market watchers note. The phenomenon is occurring not just for bungalows in GCB Areas but also for other categories of private residential properties being bought for investment.In some of these cases, it could well be that parents are buying a property for a child aged 21 and above as a gift - to give him or her a headstart in life.However, agents reckon that for some who already own at least one residential property here, another reason for buying an investment property using a child's name may be to avoid incurring additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) - assuming the child does not already own a property here.Doing so may result in substantial savings in ABSD, since no ABSD is payable on the first residential property purchased by a Singaporean. Based on current ABSD rates which took effect on July 6, 2018, the ABSD payable by a Singaporean on the second residential property purchase is 12 per cent; for a S$30 million property, the ABSD would amount to S$3.6 million. If this is the third and subsequent property, the ABSD rate is 15 per cent, or $4.5 million.Property consultants do not think the number of such purchases is significant.That said, the phenomenon may throw into the foreground a sense of social inequity. \"ABSD and other cooling measures were introduced to reduce excessive property investing here which had resulted in private home prices spiralling upwards. Those with the means, however, can get around the rules by buying in the names of their children,\" says an analyst who declined to be named.This is one of several anomalies that have arisen as property-hungry investors seek ways to get around the cooling measures, principally the ABSD. Let's take a closer look at some of the other unexpected things that have surfaced due to cooling measures, and their potential implications.From trusts to decouplingParents with children too young to own property have been advised to consider buying the property through a trust listing a young child as beneficiary; one may look at this as an advance inheritance. Upon turning 21, the child can call for the property to be transferred to him or her. This is the solution that some property agents began suggesting to potential investors, even at showflats of mass-market condo projects, after the government raised ABSD rates by 5 percentage points last July.However, again, setting up such a trust structure to buy property would be an option more for those with the means as it would be tough to secure bank financing - given that the beneficiary is under the legal age to own a property and different financing rules apply when the purchase is made through a trust.As a result, agents typically tell buyers that such a purchase would have to be an all-cash transaction, with no bank financing.In any case, not many parents would resort to such a route, as once the trust is set up, it cannot be revoked.Decoupling is another unexpected consequence of cooling measures, notes Rajah & Tann partner Norman Ho.Supposing a couple jointly owns just one residental property in Singapore, they could decouple their ownership with one spouse transferring his or her share in the property to the other spouse. This creates a sole owner, leaving the other half of the pair free to buy another residential property without having to pay the ABSD as that purchase would be deemed to be his or her first.Some couples took to this approach following the introduction of ABSD in late 2011. The trend gained momentum following the January 2013 change to the ABSD rules, when Singaporeans had to start paying ABSD from their second residential property here, instead of the third.Under last July's cooling measures, ABSD rates for second and subsequent property purchases were hiked by 5 percentage points, for both Singaporeans and permanent residents. As a result, the decoupling trend may gain further momentum.While decoupling could make financial sense for some couples here, there could be potential hiccups, says Mr Ho. \"What happens if the couple decide to divorce later on? Does the spouse who has transferred his or her share of the property have an equitable interest or claim on the matrimonial home any more?\"JLL senior director of research and consultancy Ong Teck Hui observes that various rounds of cooling measures have shaped the psyche of market participants to engage in pre-emptive behaviour. \"The fear of more measures encourages some people to jump into the market. The classic example was on the night of July 5 last year. Within a few hours of cooling measures being announced, developers of at least three major projects brought forward launches to the same evening to catch buyers before the measures took effect the following day.\"Buyers responded well - ironically resulting in a spike in new private home sales volume during the month when higher ABSD rates and a 5-percentage point cut in loan-to-value (LTV) limits were introduced.Says Mr Ong: \"Such reactions may not be healthy as some buyers could have taken the plunge without proper due diligence on their purchases.\" Analysts advise buyers not to be too highly leveraged to better handle any unexpected price corrections.Mr Ho of Rajah and Tann also points out that many Singaporeans deterred by the ABSD from investing in residential properties at home have gone overseas - some with not-so-positive outcomes.\"Some who bought residential properties in Australia are stuck now because of the market downturn; moreover, second-hand homes can be resold only to Australian nationals and permanent residents. Meanwhile, Iskandar is reeling from oversupply.\"He suggests that to avoid such situations as well as the potential problems caused by decoupling, the authorities should once again allow Singapore citizens to buy a second residential property here without having to pay ABSD.The authorities, however, may beg to differ. ABSD was introduced and extended, with duty rates raised, to discourage overinvesting in Singapore residential properties which had led to escalations in private home prices that were running ahead of economic fundamentals. It was to avoid potentially destabilising corrections later on that the current set of cooling measures were put in place.Still, there could be room for some fine tuning.Developers' viewA veteran residential developer shared his view with BT that even the rapid land price increase in 2017 and 2018 - that was arrested only after the July 2018 cooling measures were announced - was, strangely enough, the result of earlier cooling measures.He was referring to a key condition for developers in exchange for upfront remission of ABSD payable when they buy residential land: they have to undertake to complete developing the new project on the site and to sell all its units within five years.\"Due to developers being pressured to finish selling residential projects, many of us soon found ourselves running out of development land around 2016-2017.\"This also coincided with a period of low supply in the confirmed list of the Government Land Sales Programme. The ensuing intense competition for land led to land prices shooting up at state tenders and later on spreading to private-sector collective sales.Thus began the en bloc sale frenzy, which further fuelled increases in land prices, reflecting developers' expectations of continued rapid increase in private home prices. This led to the authorities reining in the situation with last July's cooling measures.Market players also highlighted that at some points during the past couple of years, some developers have had to pay higher-than-normal commission rates to property agents to incentivise them to clear the remaining units in their projects before the five-year deadline.A seasoned agent confirms that from late 2017 to the early part of 2018, commissions of about 3 to 5 per cent and in a few cases as high as 7 per cent were offered - against the market norm of about 1 to 2 per cent for new launches at the time. However, he adds that the abnormally high commission rates were due to the fact that the last few unsold units in a project are often the hardest to move: for example, large apartments on the top floors which are relatively big-ticket items in mass-market condos, or low-floor units with not-so-attractive facing.To avoid a situation such as this, the developer suggests that instead of requiring developers to completely sell out their project within five years,it would be more feasible if the sales target could be lowered to 80 to 85 per cent of units. \"This would still achieve the same thing: to ensure developers do not have too much pricing power,\" he added.Mr Ho of Rajah and Tann argues that it is unfair to impose a uniform five-year sales deadline regardless of project size. \"For a small project of say 40 to 50 units, the five-year sales deadline is not an issue. But if you have a project with 1,000 units or more, the authorities should give the developer more time to clear the units.\"Perhaps, a possible solution could be to have a hybrid of the above two suggestions.For projects with a large number of units, the authorities could still set a five-year deadline for the developer to sell, say, 80-85 per cent of units, with a further one to two years to dispose of the balance units.It may be harder to unravel some of the other anomalous effects of cooling measures. Who knows if such attempts could in turn create another round of unintended consequences.Ultimately, most of the anomalies discussed here have surfaced as a result of Singaporeans going around property cooling measures - because of their deep-seated affinity with property and also driven by ample liquidity and a lack of suitable investment alternatives at home.Veteran property consultant Ong Choon Fah, chief executive of Edmund Tie and Company, says: \"Singaporeans love property because firstly it is tangible. You can see, touch and feel a property. You can live in it, rent it, let your grown-up children live in it or simply treat it as your holiday home. As a nation, we have a very successful home ownership scheme, the bedrock of which are Housing Board flats. There is a lot of emotional link to property; it is something enduring that you can leave for your children.\"Historically, property has done well because we are a Little Red Dot with limited land; we always think that prices can only go up.\"A mindset change may be required. \"What we need to consider is also whether we have the capacity to hold the property through market cycles. You have to be prepared for a situation where if you cannot find a tenant, you'll still have to pay your mortgage instalment, property tax and maintenance/service charges. And don't forget to factor in the transaction costs involved when you buy, sell or lease a property,\" notes Ms Ong.She also urges property investors to do their research and consider their own risk profile carefully before plunging into the market.Singaporeans need to learn from the savvy foreigners who invest here; they are aware that there are always risks in every investment. \"Some foreigners are prepared to pay very high prices for Singapore properties because they have other considerations such as the potential of the Singapore dollar strengthening against their home currency. So it's a different ballgame for them.\"Therefore our buyers cannot just look at these foreigners buying property and jump in and follow them.\"Some developers may advocate that the authorities adopt a laissez faire approach. However, to ask the Singapore government to completely leave the property market to free market forces and not to \"interfere\" by coming up with cooling measures is also not a realistic expectation. The government already has a big role in the residential property market, being the developer of public housing, which provides a roof over the heads of the vast majority of Singaporeans.The state is also a major and consistent source of land for private housing development. The policy of allowing the use of individuals' Central Provident Fund savings towards the purchase of residential property is already integrated into our real estate ecosystem. \"We are a small nation with limited resources. Repercussions will be amplified if the market experiences the volatility of a totally-free property market,\" says Ms Ong."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

In 2017, there were 3,492 apartments sold in collective sales worth S$8.6 billion, compared to 3,216 units which netted S$10.8 billion in the first 11 months of 2018, according to real estate consultancy JLL Research. This translates to an average S$2.5 million for each unit in 2017 and S$3.4 million in 2018.For most of these newly minted millionaires who came into money after selling their homes, the transfer of wealth has also meant a displacement from familiar surroundings. Once the visions of sports cars and first-class travel fade, bittersweet feelings result. There are also, of course, investors for whom the windfall gain comes without the scramble to find a new home. Some - hand on heart - will sympathise, but not vocalise these sentiments with the minority who objected to the sale.Once an en bloc sale process is completed, sellers are usually given a period of up to six months to leave, a deadline that leads to much stress until a new home is secured.\"I've moved from 9 to 10 to 11,\" says a seller who went through her second collective sale at Dunearn Gardens last year, describing her move from the \"most\" prime precinct of District 9, to the outer limits of real estate desirability.Districts 9 and 10 are Singapore's most posh addresses. She had to put her travel plans on hold until she found her new home.Whether they be property investors or someone selling their home, the majority who spoke to The Business Timesabout life after en bloc asked not to be identified.The sense is that the en bloc sale is not an event to be proud of, a fortune made not through hard work. They also did not want their windfall to be made known.The cynical may say these are \"First World\" problems. Newfound wealth does help, especially in retirement planning, but the sense of loss from a home that has been lived in for decades doesn't quite go away, many told BT.BittersweetEven 14 years later, the en bloc still rankles.Former journalist Conrad Raj says he got about S$1 million in 2005 for his apartment.The en bloc price worked out to less than S$500 per square foot. His flat was 1,250 sq ft and the building was on freehold land in prime Cairnhill, a stone's throw from Goodwood Park Hotel.Mr Raj, now 71, says half of the proceeds went towards an Housing & Development Board (HDB) flat in Dover Close East, and he banked in the rest.Life has been good to him since then, he notes. That's because he has continued working, and also due to some \"initiatives on his part\".\"Every little bit counted,\" says Mr Raj.\"If the idiots in my Cairnhill block had held out for a couple of months more, we would have gotten more than double what we actually got,\" he points out.\"And I preferred my previous place which was far more convenient and wished I had gotten more to buy a similar place in the same area. I always enjoyed my life, and, sure, I had to make adjustments.\"In a BT article in 2005, Mr Raj explained why colleagues missed the point when they couldn't fathom his anguish over the en bloc.He wrote then: \"What these people failed to realise was that I like living in my flat on Cairnhill Road. It's next to the Environment Building on Scotts Road, and Newton MRT station is a five-minute walk. The Orchard Station is perhaps 10 minutes away. Buses serve me on Orchard, Scotts and Bukit Timah Roads. Taxis are so easy to hail that I very rarely need to make a booking.\"What's more, Orchard Road and its malls, hotels and supermarkets are minutes away. The Newton Food Centre is even closer.\"For a person who doesn't drive, these are important considerations. Because of the convenient location, friends are always willing to give me a lift home. Developers and property agents know the convenience of Cairnhill and therefore attach a premium to the area. Most new developments in the vicinity fetch more than S$1,000 psf.\"According to Mr Raj, his replacement home, an HDB flat, is bigger but the previous one was better designed and \"it was freehold\".HDB flats which are sold on a 99-year lease must be returned to the state at the end of their tenure.While many en bloc sellers buy another private property with their proceeds, there are also many who buy an HDB property instead: when the money that \"fell into their laps\" does not afford them, at current prices, a new home where they used to live.With increasing numbers of HDB flats nearing the half-way mark of their 99-year leases, the whittling-down of value has sparked debate about home ownership and anxiety among some HDB dwellers.Downsizing\"It's nice that my parents have a little safety net now,\" says one former resident of Eunosville, near Eunos MRT station.The sprawling 330-unit Eunosville, built in the 1980s, was sold in 2017 to Jardine Matheson Group unit MCL Land for S$765 million. Each owner got about S$2.25 million to S$2.41 million.\"My mother hasn't worked for about 20 years and my dad had to rely on his income and the generosity of family members who paid for mine and my brother's education,\" the Eunosville resident says.\"It's not an ideal situation because we ended up being forced out (my parents were one of the few who didn't sign in favour of the en bloc), and the homes in my old neighbourhood are way too expensive (the amount given didn't allow my parents to buy a place of the same size in the area.\"\"They would have had to downgrade which is terribly unfair given that we were there for 25 years. But it did help us in a roundabout way even if it means that we now have to travel much further to get to town and spend way more on Grab!\"Another en bloc millionaire, who is 65 and about to move to his new home, remains ambivalent about the S$1.87 million he got from the collective sale of Florence Regency.The 336-unit Florence Regency in Hougang was sold to Chinese developer Logan Property for S$629 million in October 2017.\"I've lived there 29 years and expected to do so until I die,\" he says. He spent over half the money on a new HDB flat in a choice location, gave about S$200,000 to his two children and put the rest of the money in a fixed deposit.\"The en bloc (money) helps a lot but at the expense of downgrading to a smaller flat,\" he points out, adding that he tells his friends who congratulate him on his newfound wealth that the millionaire status didn't last long.His Florence Regency home was 1,800 sq ft, versus his new abode of 1,150 sq ft.One en bloc-er who got S$2.87 million from the sale managed to find his new home in the same district. But it meant downsizing to a small apartment for about half the amount.\"My en bloc was in 2012 in the East Coast (Amber Road) and I stayed in the East Coast, though my new place is seven kilometres away. So yes, it's the same area but a little distance away,\" he adds.He returned a chunk of the balance to the Central Provident Fund (CPF), and invested the rest in Reits (real estate investment trusts) and capital-guaranteed insurance products.\"No need to take risk at this age. Yes, I'm OK to retire tomorrow thanks to the en bloc.\"That life has improved as financial needs are not a big worry is a constant refrain from those who spoke to BT, as long as they don't overstretch themselves in the replacement home purchase.Most sellers are middle age or baby boomers, staring at long years of retirement.Singaporeans are expected to remain among the longest-lived people in the world in 2040, according to a recent study published in the medical journal The Lancet.Researchers estimate the average lifespan in the Republic will go up from 83.3 years in 2016 to 85.4 years by 2040, placing it third out of 195 countries.One professional says she hasn't decided on what she will do with the proceeds, other than set up an account with a private bank and start a three-month fixed deposit while mulling over the matter.She also topped up her CPF enhanced retirement sum.\"If I buy a modest property, I hope to still have about S$500,000 targeted for retirement. In reality, when I look at the stratospheric prices for a new two-bedroom condo, I only feel temporarily rich,\" she says. \"So I may go for an older property eventually rather than a pricey, tiny, new condo.\"Is life after en bloc a life-changer?It's a little too soon to know, she feels. \"There's a sense of financial security for now, but Singapore is expensive. I am relieved that the en bloc deal went through after three tries and before the cooling measures kicked in.\"Cooling measures were introduced in the middle of last year to calm property prices which had risen faster than economic fundamentals, the government said when it decided to tame the market.Describing the windfall as \"a Christmas gift worth over S$2 million\", one of the first things the professional did was write a cheque to a new charity for single mums, at a fund-raising lunch.\"That was to remind myself that the en bloc cash is a gift that I can share. I bought gifts and dinners for my family. Treated myself to a fancy suitcase and skincare,\" she reveals. \"This outflow is under S$10,000 - I decided not to overspend and to roll out my purchases over time.\"For those who are happy to cash out and in favour of the collective sale, the motivation is generally that they don't need to worry any more over financial matters, says a retiree who's in her 50s.\"One of my neighbours who got S$4.7 million bought an executive condo for S$1.5 million,\" she adds.Dumb investments, bad behaviourOne not so-fortuitous outcome is investment into complex financial products, introduced by bankers who target en bloc sellers.Several banks have sent relationship managers (RM) to condos which are sold en bloc to woo the newly-rich.\"The dumbest investment was listening to my RM to punt in dual currency,\" says the retiree. \"She took me around the world; I did one on Aussie when it was 1.30 to one Singapore dollar, another on sterling.\"One Aussie dollar was worth less than one Singapore dollar, at the end of last year.\"All lost money. She then suggested investing the Aussie dollar into Aussie bonds, and I am still trying to recover,\" she adds. \"RMs are so smart, they see a big deposit into the account, they come calling.\"Still, the retiree did enjoy herself by splurging on a brand-new luxury European car. She had previously owned a second-hand sports car.\"Some of us decided to give ang pows to the long-serving cleaner and security guards at the condo\" on the day the cheques were received by the residents, she says.One seller who's also an avid watch collector rewarded himself with a S$40,000-plus watch, among his most expensive buys ever. For others, travel has become more luxurious, as they now fly business class on long-haul flights.The differences after a sale really are superficial rather than deep-seated changes, according to en bloc-ers.\"My life won't change, my values remain. I now have more money, but I still look at prices, if it's not a good deal, or good value, I won't buy,\" says the retiree. \"Of course, I feel more comfortable, more confident because you have money\" to back it up.But happiness?The watch collector rails against his neighbours for their distinctly antisocial and un-civic behaviour, dumping old furniture and all manner of debris during their moving out into the common areas, causing not just unsightly mountains of detritus but also potential safety and fire risks.\"It's digusting,\" he says.A fellow resident took pictures and called the authorities, he adds, and eventually the management committee engaged cleaning professionals to clear the mess.The sweet smell of a successful en bloc sale doesn't linger, it seems."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

In his more than two-decade career as a capital-markets lawyer in Singapore, he'd helped more than 30 companies list on the country's stock exchange, bringing to market everything from a grocery store chain to a pawnbroker. Business had been good, but it was starting to dry up. Lee decided he had to get out. \"I saw the decline,\" he says. \"That's why I moved.\"That was in 2014, when more companies left the Singapore Exchange than joined it, with $8.4 billion in value disappearing from the public market. Lee, now 50, quit his job and became a partner in the Singapore office of the US law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. While he still works on SGX listings, he spends more than three-quarters of his time helping companies throughout Asia to restructure and make asset purchases.The exchange's fortunes have only gotten worse. For the last five years, delistings have outnumbered listings in the market, which had 741 companies at the end of December last year, down from a peak of 782 in 2010. In 2018, the money raised from the 15 SGX initial public offerings, excluding depositary receipts, fell to just $710.6 million, while 19 companies departed - a net outflow of $19.2 billion in market value. But while money has been leaving the public markets, Singapore has strengthened its position as a leading wealth hub in Asia, with private banks overseeing more than US$2 trillion in assets and providing alternative investment opportunities in structured products, real estate, and private equity.Many of the businesses that have left the exchange in the past few years are well-known in Singapore. They range from GLP, one of the world's biggest warehouse owners, to Osim International, Asia's largest maker of massage chairs. Some chief executive officers who've taken their companies private, lamenting what they see as low valuations in the city-state, are seeking more liquid markets that can generate higher stock prices. For example, Lee says, sofa maker Man Wah Holdings Ltd was taken private in September 2009. Within six months, it was relisted in Hong Kong at about eight times its market value.Chew Sutat, SGX's head of equities and fixed-income businesses, says delisting is a global trend. What's more, he says, it's a healthy market function that weeds out weaker companies. Unlike some exchanges, Chew says, SGX doesn't refrain from delisting zombie companies just to keep its numbers up.But that doesn't tell the whole story. As of the end of last year, the market capitalization of companies with primary listings in Singapore had fallen by $97.5 billion, or 14 per cent, from the end of 2014, according to SGX data. The bourse's average daily turnover has been halved since 2007. \"These trends are worrying,\" says Ngoh Yi Sin, an analyst at Singapore's CGS-CIMB Securities International.More worrisome, perhaps, some homegrown champions are bypassing SGX altogether. Take gaming company Razer Inc, one of the country's few recent consumer-technology successes, led by Singaporean-born CEO Tan Min-Liang and backed by sovereign wealth fund GIC. When it listed in November 2017, it opted for Hong Kong, which has benefited markedly from its proximity to China and its \"stock connects\" - authorized cross-boundary investment channels - to mainland China exchanges.While Singapore and Hong Kong vie for the mantle of Asia's premier financial hub, the South-east Asian nation has always lagged behind in terms of listings, because it has a smaller pool of domestic companies and no hinterland to depend on. And the gap is widening as Hong Kong cements its position as the venue of choice for Chinese companies. Hong Kong raised US$33.5 billion from IPOs in 2018 - more than any exchange anywhere - as big name after big name came to market. China Tower Corp, a state-owned infrastructure company, raised US$7.5 billion in what was at the time the world's biggest IPO in two years. Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp raised US$5.4 billion, and Meituan Dianping, a food delivery giant backed by Tencent Holdings, procured US$4.2 billion.Hong Kong's market is now so much larger and more vibrant than Singapore's, the two can't even be compared, says Tham Tuck Seng, PwC's head of capital markets in Singapore. The imbalance is practically impossible to right, because companies naturally gravitate to bigger, more liquid markets. \"They're two different fishes,\" Tham says. And it's not just Hong Kong that's overshadowed Singapore. In 2018 even South-east Asia's regional exchanges left Singapore in their wake: The Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange in Vietnam raised US$2.9 billion; Thailand's bourse, US$2.6 billion.All the while, markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen have become much more accessible to overseas investors. James Thom, an Asian equities fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Singapore, says his firm has been selling its Singapore holdings to buy Chinese A-shares over the last three years. \"It's home to some good-quality companies,\" he says of Singapore. But, he says, \"if you think about the centre of gravity in Asia and where it's going, it's all shifting to mainland China.\"Singapore once seemed on the verge of becoming the public-market investor's gateway to Asia's emerging economies. But in recent years it's been increasingly cast aside as South-east Asian companies opt to list on their own exchanges, Hong Kong scoops up much of China's IPO pipeline, and markets such as Shanghai and Shenzhen open up to foreign investors through stock connects with Hong Kong.The world still sees Singapore as a remarkable success story: the island nation Lee Kuan Yew turned into the world's third-richest country in a single generation. A low-tax regime, transparent legal structures, a highly educated workforce, and a welcoming attitude to multinational corporations all helped turn the city-state into one of the world's leading financial centre despite its small size (it's about half as large as Los Angeles) and population (5.6 million). In some quarters, Singapore, with its ability to attract foreign investment, has even been cited as a model for post-Brexit Britain.But the fate of the stock market - once the undisputed South-east Asian powerhouse, broadening its reach into China - raises questions. As China outpaces most of the world economically, largely to the benefit of Hong Kong's capital market, where does that leave Singapore's? And where does that, in turn, leave the country?Singapore's stock exchange dates to 1973, when it split from the Malaysian bourse. By the end of 1999, 335 companies were listed on the main board. Shortly thereafter, the exchange moved into its iconic headquarters, the twin-towered SGX Centre on Shenton Way, which then housed some of Singapore's biggest financial institutions.In the 2000s, SGX brought in many Chinese companies. With a population that's more than 70 per cent ethnically Chinese, the city-state became a natural alternative venue for such businesses. The so-called S-chips, Singapore-listed Chinese companies, continued to dominate the IPO market until a series of high-profile scandals in the 2010s, similar to the frauds uncovered at Chinese companies that listed via reverse takeovers in the US. Singapore, eager to welcome foreign listings, had eased the requirements for companies to join the bourse. Some of them were fraudulent, says Mak Yuen Teen, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore. Domestic investors got burned.Then, in 2013, local punters experienced another crash. A penny-stock rout wiped out $8 billion, in what the authorities called the \"largest market manipulation case in Singapore's history.\" Three individuals illegally pumped the shares of three smaller companies, which surged at least 800 per cent in nine months before plunging over three trading days. Again, local investors bore the brunt of the losses. The Catalist market, the exchange's venue for smaller, growth companies, never quite recovered, says Gibson Dunn's Lee: \"It came to a grinding halt.\"These days, Mak says, retail investors account for an estimated 30 per cent of the market. The number of S-chips has greatly diminished. What are left are the safe, steady companies that form SGX's backbone. These are mostly stocks favored not for their growth prospects but for their dividends-backed by state investment firm Temasek Holdings or a wealthy family such as the Kweks (financial services and property) or the Wees (banking and property). \"They appeal to a certain kind of investor,\" says Carmen Lee, head of investment research at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. (OCBC). \"A lot of private bank money is now in Singapore, and they actually like the core, somewhat boring, defensive stocks,\" she says.Three big banks - DBS, OCBC, and United Overseas Bank - account for more than 40 per cent of the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI). Property and telecommunications companies make up an additional 23 per cent. The STI also includes some big foreign listings, such as Thai Beverage PCL and parts of the Jardine Matheson conglomerate, which moved to Singapore three years before the British handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997.But when it comes to technology companies, there's only one in the STI: Venture Corp, a 34-year-old provider of electronics manufacturing services. \"There is a real dearth of new interesting companies,\" says Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management in Singapore. \"Nothing that I can think of.\"Ron Tan is chairman and CEO of Cityneon Holdings Ltd, which mounts exhibitions modeled on blockbuster movies such as Marvel Entertainment's The Avengers and NBCUniversal Media's Jurassic World. In 2018, even though Cityneon's SGX-listed stock had been surging since a low three years earlier, Tan decided to take the company private. He says he was dissatisfied with Cityneon's valuation. Growth stocks such as his, which don't pay dividends, are misunderstood in Singapore, he says, because investors have become so accustomed to the steadier, dividend-yielding companies that make up most of the market, as is the case in Zurich and Dubai.It's a stultifying mindset, he says, and it applies to everyone involved. \"It's the ecosystem-the exchange, the fund managers, the retail investors, even the way I've been brought up,\" he says. \"I'm a Singaporean, so I myself am programmed this way, so I cannot blame the rest of the people here when they look at my own company.\"Beyond the concerns about low valuations and thin trading, a closer look reveals that some of the factors often cited as driving Singapore's economic success are the very ones holding back the stock market.First, there's the education system. Singapore has gained international recognition for producing high-achieving students in math and science, but it's done so through an emphasis on following rules and rote learning. That, says UBS's Tay, impinges on creative thinking and leads to a lack of people starting businesses that might eventually list on the exchange. \"We ask ourselves why we don't create enough entrepreneurs and creative people,\" he says. \"It's not that we don't have them. It's just that the system does not allow it. If you have to spend so much time becoming exam-smart, you have very little time to be creative.\"Homeownership - revered in Singapore - is another drag on the stock market. Former Prime Minister Lee reasoned that if Singaporeans owned their own property, they'd be more invested in the country and its economy, and he instituted policies to encourage just that. Today, Singapore has one of the highest levels of homeownership in the world, about 90 per cent. Its people have a staggering US$949 billion invested in real estate, accounting for 44 per cent of household assets. This is the \"traditional path,\" says Jaime Pang, a 31-year-old lawyer. \"You get a job, you get married, you put all your money into a house, and there isn't much left over to invest in the stock market.\"As a result, stocks and securities account for just 9.6 per cent of household assets, according to government statistics. That compares with 48 per cent in the US. And Singaporeans who do put money into equities increasingly turn to options beyond the city-state, a diversification that's facilitated by exchange-traded funds, among other things. \"Local investors are savvy and have more international options,\" CGS-CIMB's Ngoh says.SGX has taken steps to arrest the market's decline. In 2018 it introduced dual-class shares that provide some company owners with superior voting rights. It's formed co-listing partnerships with Nasdaq and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. It's also expanded an in-house research team dedicated to highlighting the exchange's small and mid-cap stocks, while the government is launching a $75 million grant to help companies go public. But the slide continues.In the end, says Chua Hak Bin, a senior economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research, Singapore \"will just be a very niche market.\" And maybe that's enough. Chua cites SGX's strengths: an established real estate investment trust market; notably high valuations for medical-services companies; and a good track record in listing consumer stocks. For his part, SGX's Chew points to the exchange's success in helping companies raise funds beyond their initial offerings, and he says that Singapore is still the market of choice for firms looking to expand regionally and tap international investors. About half of the companies listed on SGX are foreign, and institutional money trusts the Singapore market, he says.Like many of its peers, SGX has diversified beyond equities into derivatives, says Michael Wu, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Hong Kong. According to his calculations, SGX got 40 percent of its revenue from futures and options from Sept 30, 2017, to June 30, 2018, compared with just 26 per cent from cash equities.Does it matter if the Singapore stock market shrinks?The economy is thriving as Singapore prepares for its third leadership transition in 53 years, with Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat set to take over by 2022 from the current prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong. The World Bank ranked the nation second out of 190 countries for ease of doing business in a 2018 report. Its gross domestic product per capita, based on purchasing power parity, ranks third in the world: US$98,260 as of 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund. GDP, which is driven by manufacturing, trade, finance, and business services, has grown consistently - albeit at a moderate pace-since the global financial crisis. And the country was ranked Asia's most competitive wealth management centre - ahead of Hong Kong and second only to Switzerland globally - in a Deloitte report last year.The government has invested billions in nurturing industries such as health care and biomedical sciences, and in creating an attractive environment for technology start-ups. It's also pursuing its plans for a \"Smart Nation\" that runs its roads and industries and everything in between on cutting-edge technology.Some of those bets have already paid off. Since the early 2000s, Singapore has doubled the number of jobs in the biopharmaceutical industry, to more than 6,000, as GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Roche Holding, and other companies set up local bases.None of this is particularly dependent on the health of the stock market. A smaller pool of companies limits the choices investors have even as the fund management industry continues to grow, and Justin Tang, the head of Asian research at United First Partners, says having a sleepy stock market does little to burnish Singapore's reputation as a financial hub. But in the grander scheme of things, Chua of Maybank Kim Eng says, the stock market isn't as important as it used to be. \"A vibrant capital market is an added advantage or added benefit to the economy,\" he says. \"It's not the only thing.\"Indeed, the delisting trend could be a good sign, says Tamara Henderson, who covers Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand for Bloomberg Economics in Singapore. It creates a situation in which unlisted companies, free of the constraints of quarterly reporting, are more able to focus on long-term growth, thereby stabilizing the economy. \"It's probably a sign of wealth,\" she says.And in Singapore, wealth definitely matters: It's one of the cornerstones of the economy. As far as Aberdeen's Thom is concerned, the stock market has little bearing on the \"tremendous growth\" in Singapore's wealth management sector or the vibrancy of the financial industry generally. What's more important, he says, is the perception that the country is a safe place to park money, with access to good advice and good money managers. And a thriving stock market? \"A nice-to-have rather than a need-to-have.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Dubbed SG4, the seven-storey development will offer an initial capacity of 1,400 cabinets across 45,000 sqft in its first phase before accommodating more than 4,000 cabinets at full build out. Equinix regarded Singapore as a critical market that will play a central role in the regions digital transformation given the number of undersea cables transiting in the island itself. The construction and management of a data centre employs people from various fields of work. Following the opening of a data centre, there are roles for logistics companies, utilities providers, repairs and maintenance specialists, and securities and janitorial staff, Equinix Asia-Pacifics VP for corporate development and strategy Andrew Rigoli told Singapore Business Review. The spill over effect just to build and run a data centre is enormous, and this is enabling jobs and creating economic opportunities. Data centres are considered to be the backbone of the IT sector and remain crucial to the rapidly-changing sectors development. The Singapore colocation market generated an estimated $1.3b in 2017, and was expected to grow 13% YoY in 2018, according to Structure Researchs 2017 Singapore Data Centre Supply report. By 2021, Singapores market is expected to be worth $2b which represents a 12% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). In Q4 2017, there were a total of 33 data centre providers in Singapores market covering a total space of 2.6 million sqft, data from Structure Research show. We estimate that around 0.7 million sqft of data centre space on a gross area basis would have been completed in 2018, Colliers Internationals head of research for Singapore Tricia Songsaid. We expect this total stock to more than double by 2022 with another 3.8 million sqft known supply pipeline including Facebooks 1.8 million sqft data centre in Tanjong Kling which is scheduled to complete in 2022. But despite the increasing demand and opportunities data centres present, operators in Singapore continue to face land scarcity challenges given the islands size and zoning restrictions. Data centres need to be at a B2 zoning area which are areas intended to be used for large industry, warehouse, utilities and telecommunications, Knight Frank Singapores executive director and head of industrial services Boon Leong Tan explained. Tai Seng has the greatest concentration of data centres because traditionally, such buildings in the area are suited better to house data centres. Under B2 zoning rules, business need to impose nuisance buffer more than 50 meters and within health and safety buffers in addition, to the requirement of being far away from residential estates. Data centres also need to have a good structure that can support all of its backups, such as a flat roof that will hold its back up batteries and power supply, Tan elaborated. However, given that 90% of the industrial land in Singapore is owned by Jurong Town Corporation (JTC), not every site is suitable for housing a data centre, Tan highlighted. If JTC does not allow a data centre to be located at a certain area or building, theres nothing that can be done, he said. The high costs of building and maintaining data centres is also another factor to consider given the large capital investment needed to set up storage servers. Cushman & Wakefield noted that the construction of a new data centre can go for US$100m for a multi-tenanted facility to as much as US$1.5b for a cloud campus that can house several buildings in addition to required preventive and maintenance costs. The costs of construction, maintenance and utilities in Singapore are also amongst the highest in Southeast Asia, potentially raising the total costs for operators to set up data centres in Singapore, Song added. But even with the relatively higher land costs, Singapore remains unrivaled as Southeast Asias top data centre hub that is, if the likes of Indonesia, Hong Kong and China cannot keep up.Song highlighted that countries with large populations such as India and Thailand make forlogical investment destinations for large data centre operators so long as they step up their infrastructure and investor-friendly policies. She added that these markets have in fact, been ramping up their development in recent years, noting how Keppel Corporation announced its plans to develop and operate its first data centre in Johor, Malaysia with an expected completion date in 2020. Also read: Keppel DC REIT expands to Australia through new data centre Tom Duncan, CBRE Asia Pacifics executive director for data centre solutions, added that should Singapore be unable to meet the hyperscale cloud demand on the back of land shortage and high costs, companies will undoubtedly look elsewhere in Southeast Asia for solutions. Opportunities are emerging in developing colocation markers such as China and India, Duncan said. Zooming into Southeast Asia, the main emerging market at the moment is Jakarta but it will take some time before it can be considered a significant challenger since it requires considerable additional investment in the sub-sea cable network. According to an earlier report by DBS, Indonesia offers the best return on invested capital (ROIC) in the region on the back of its favourable supply-demand dynamics, whilst Singapore only offered a moderate ROIC with new supply set to enter the market. Neverthless, the unwaning demand for data centres in Singapore will continue in 2019 as more companies with no data room storage of their own expected to seek out cloud service providers to store their data. Coupled with the governments Smart Nation initiatives, an expected rollout plan of 5G and fintech development, higher requirements on data privacy, security and latency will also continue. And despite the hold of larger multinational companies on the data centre market, local operators such as Keppel DC REIT, Singtel and ST Telemedia are forecasted to remain dominant in Singapore. We think that local operators may hold an advantage over foreign players in that they probably have better local market knowledge and relationships, and could be better placed to source for land and business deals, Song highlighted.Duncan echoed that there is still room for local and start up operators to make an impact, particularly in sectors such as hyperscale cloud, even as the marketgoes through a period of significant mergers and acquisitions (M&As).Also read: Hyperscale data centre operator AirTrunk bags $851m funding for expansion Tan agreed, further adding that competition amongst local and international players will be beneficial in sprucing up Singapores data centre market with more competitive rates and improved offerings."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

We expect interested parties to conduct extensive due diligence on the site, and will do our best to gather as much information to help prospective tenderers assess the merits of the plot, as well as minimise potential risks and lower the level of uncertainty.\"In the coming weeks, we will be engaging the authorities to seek more clarity on traffic impact study, the feasibility of a phased redevelopment of the site, and even explore the possibility of selling the site as two separate plots.\"Separately, Alex Teo, chairman of the Braddell View collective sale committee, said: \"Having acquired the 80 per cent consensus to take the collective sale process forward is a key milestone in our en bloc sale journey. We started the signing process a year ago, and we knew then that it would not be an easy task given the large number of owners in the estate. I am heartened that owners have been open-minded, engaged and committed throughout the entire signing process, cognisant of the fact that the estate is ageing and in need of rejuvenation.\"Under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 2014, the site is zoned for residential use. It has a gross plot ratio of 2.1, and will have a proposed total gross floor area of about 2.4 million sq ft.The development, which was completed around 1981, was the last HUDC estate to be privatised. Its privatisation in March 2017 marked the closure of the Government's privatisation programme for HUDC estates.Colliers estimates that up to 2,620 new residential units with an average size of about 915 sq ft could be built on the site, subject to approval from the relevant authorities."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The URA made an early stab at opening up the private land developer market to Singapore's first \"private retirement housing product\" in 2008, with the Jalan Jurong Kechil site eventually bought by World Class Land and launched as The Hillford.But there were also grouses about that project. Without any age limits in place, younger buyers flocked to invest in the development, as the 60-year lease made units cheaper.Since then, the lack of solid retirement housing may have become even more of a bugbear in Singapore. The Housing Board ended a studio apartment scheme for seniors in 2015, more than a decade after the first owners got their keys, and rolled out two-room \"flexi-flats\" instead.Besides these flats, independent seniors not yet in need of dedicated care seem to have bifurcated options: welfare homes for the destitute aged, or pricier places like the St Bernadette Lifestyle Village, which opened in 2015 with eight residents at S$3,500 a head.But one selling point of the senior studios was the activity centres tailored just for the elderly, under each block - with private organisations monitoring panic buttons, running gyms and offering traditional Chinese medicine clinics.Group homes in HDB rental blocks, such as the AWWA Senior Community Home set up by the Asian Women's Welfare Association in Ang Mo Kio, offer another model for developers to glean inspiration.Reviving such senior living - albeit with safeguards for consumers, such as minimum unit sizes, commitments to maintaining amenities, and an age bar on residents - could be quite lucrative for private players.In some ways, retirement villages would resemble serviced apartments more than condominiums, with potential income streams from recurring service contracts - home care aides, housekeeping, catered meals, fitness programmes, and the like.The URA has also said that \"the quantum of all ancillary or non-residential uses needed for support or management of a residential estate\" can be determined by the authorities based on the scale of the development. While earlier retirement home efforts have not really panned out, the concept's time may have come at last.The landscape is much greyer than it was a decade ago. The share of elderly people in the resident population climbed from 8.7 per cent in 2008 to 13.7 per cent last year. Among these over-65s, some 8.2 per cent called private apartments home. Singapore-listed groups - from real estate's Wee Hur Holdings and Far East Orchard, to diversifiers such as Centurion Corp and Business Times publisher Singapore Press Holdings - have already built up experience in purpose-built student accommodation projects in overseas markets.It's not that much of a stretch going from purpose-built for students, to purpose-built for seniors - which means that Braddell View, once an HUDC estate, could yet be re-invented as \"aged you\" residences.To be sure, Braddell View sits on prime real estate, so channelling it into newer, perhaps unproven, types of housing might be seen by some as a waste of perfectly valuable land.But the land is only as valuable as units in the redeveloped projects - and watchers have been sounding the alarm over how sustainable this business model can be for developers.Forget \"buy low, sell high\". The collective sale market fuelled a frenzy of \"buy high, sell higher\", while the apartments got smaller. At some point, consumers will wise up, and who wants to be left holding the baby?That's why it could pay for developers to keep an eye on emerging demographics and new revenue collection, other than holding showflat visitors by the ankles and shaking out the loose change in their pockets. The affluent middle-aged, heading into their golden years with an eye on a life of ease and a familiarity with smooth monthly payment plans, are just one possible segment out of several.In an over-stuffed market, where new launches wait in the wings like Brutus lurking knife in hand, developers have to think out of the shoebox."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Since then, the US has emerged as Singapores largest source of foreign direct investment, with US companies accounting for more than 20% of all foreign direct investment in the nation. US companies also invest more in Singapore than in all other Asian companies combined.Today, the two countries have moved past trade partnerships and are working together to foster security, innovation, and growth across the region. Singapore Business Review spoke with Stephanie Syptak-Ramnath, Charg dAffaires, a.i., US Embassy in Singapore, to uncover the benefits that US trade and investment brings to Singapore and the future of the partnership between both nations.What is the current state of economic relations between Singapore and the US? In a recent address to the American Chamber of Commerce, FM Balakrishnan noted that US companies played a fundamental role in the development of Singapore. He cited early investors such as Texas Instruments and HP as having brought technology to Singapore at a time when Singapore was in its early stages of development.Some key numbers tell the story of why the United States is Singapores most important economic partner and why Singapore is equally important to the United States:The United States is by far the largest single country investor in Singapore, with direct investments in Singapore worth over US$244b. US companies account for more than 20% of all foreign direct investment in Singapore and invest more than all other Asian companies combined.In the manufacturing sector, US FDI in Singapore is almost 50% more than all Asian investment in that industry. Turning to financial and insurance services, US investment is 60% larger than that of the EU, which is the second largest investor in that sector.The number of US companies in Singapore continues to increase at an encouraging rate. In the past three years, the number of American companies registered in Singapore has grown by almost 20% from 3,800 to 4,500. And, our companies dont only bring investments, they also bring jobs, training, mentorship, and corporate excellence to all that they do.From consulting to finance, US multinationals alone employ nearly 200,000 employees in Singapore. Our robust trade relationship with Singapore also supports over 250,000 jobs in the United States and approximately 36,000 Americans are employed by Singaporean companies.US-Singapore economic ties run deep, with a foundation in our bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) - the first US FTA in Asia - now in its 15th year. Singapore is the second largest Asian investor in the United States with over $73b of investments in my country and is the largest Asian investor in the US commercial real estate market.What is unique in the economic relationship between Singapore and the US?The Government of Singapore is forward leaning in building an ecosystem that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship through incentivizing startups and nurturing small and medium enterprises, including through its universities and government-affiliated institutions. American companies, universities, and individuals have been involved in many of the innovation centres and research hubs that seem to be opening in Singapore every month. Singapores efforts to boost the technology sector align with the strengths of US businesses, positioning the United States as a key partner in making Singapore and the region more economically competitive in the future.In addition, the United States and Singapore work together for greater impact in the wider region. For example, one unique mechanism that further strengthens our cooperation for the benefit of the Asia-Pacific region is the Third Country Training Program (TCTP). Aimed at providing technical assistance and training to ASEAN member states, TCTP focuses on connectivity, sustainable development, and regional resilience. Since the TCTP program was established in 2012, Singapore and the United States have jointly organized 47 workshops and trained over 1,200 ASEAN member government officials in the areas of trade, environment, health, urban planning, and disaster management, among others. We recently signed an MOU to apply that same model to cybersecurity efforts in the region, another common area of economic concern for our two countries.What are the opportunities for Singaporean businesses in the US?US Embassy Singapore is recruiting and will be accompanying a Singapore investor delegation to the SelectUSA Investment Summit June 10-12 in Washington, D.C. This is the highest-profile event dedicated to promoting foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United States. It connects qualified foreign firms directly with US economic development organizations to facilitate business investment and job creation. Each Investment Summit focuses on the US investment environment, industry trends, and new opportunities.Additionally, the Investment Summit features senior government officials, C-Suite business executives, and other thought leaders. The Investment Summit plays a vital role in attracting and facilitating international investment into the United States by raising awareness of the wide range of opportunities and positive business climate and facilitating vital direct connections between investors and economic development organizations (EDOs).Any trade and investment events that Singapore companies can get involved in?The US-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership (USACP) is a responsive, multi-year commitment that will benefit the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN), which started in Singapore during its Chairmanship year of ASEAN, by addressing smart city challenges across a range of sectors, especially in the areas of infrastructure, energy, and information and communications technology.There is also the bilateral commercial collaboration framework led by the US Department of Commerce and the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry, which was announced by Vice President Pence in November 2018 in Singapore. The framework aims to foster links between US and Singaporean companies in fields such as standards, additive manufacturing, blockchain, e-commerce, and driverless cars. Both the Singapore Business Federation and the Singapore Manufacturing Federation are working with the US Commercial Service Office at the US Embassy to find opportunities for Singapore companies to work with their US counterparts.US Embassy Singapores Commercial Service Section and American companies will also be active with the following trade shows in Singapore: ConnecTechAsia (18-20 June), ITB Asia 2019 (16-18 October), Singapore FinTech Festival (11-15 November)."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

However, there are challenges in the short term Owners of ageing commercial and mixed-use developments in the CBD received a shot in the arm with the Draft Master Plan 2019 unveiled on March 27. This is because it came with two new schemes, namely theCBD Incentive Schemeand the Strategic Development Incentive Scheme. Moray Armstrong, CBRE Singapore managing director, describes these schemes as the SkillsFuture scheme for the CBD. The old stretches of Shenton Way and Cecil Street have greatly contributed to Singapores growth as the pioneer CBD, he notes. The emergence of the new economy and Downtown CBD has resulted in these sub-markets being less favoured and to some, even being functionally obsolete. The two schemes allow for the existing developments to extend their use beyond office operation hours. These schemes are long-term plans deemed to provide a lifeline to ageing developments, adds Armstrong. The incentive of a higher plot ratio is to promote private sector-led urban regeneration in the middle to long term. However, any knee-jerk reaction will be curbed by the strict qualification rules behind each scheme as well as market sentiments. The Central area of Singapore where the URA Master Plan 2019 included the CBD Incentive Scheme and Strategic Development Scheme (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Higher plot ratios Areas earmarked for rejuvenation under the new CBD Incentive Scheme are those in theAnson Road,Cecil Street,Robinson Road,Shenton WayandTanjong Pagarareas. To qualify for the CBD rejuvenation scheme, buildings have to be at least 20 years old from the last date of Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) and where the existing use is predominantly office. Theres also a minimum plot size of 1,000 sqm for some areas, and 2,000 sqm for others. For a site in the Anson Road and Cecil Street area to be redeveloped for hotel use, or mixeduse development with residential and commercial components, the uplift in gross plot ratio is 25%. For residential use with commercial space on the first level, the new development will enjoy an increase in plot ratio of up to 30%. This CBD Incentive Scheme will be trialled for a five-year period the duration of the Master Plan 2019. The rationale for the incentives is to encourage the conversion of existing, older, office developments into mixed-use developments that will help rejuvenate the CBD. The Cecil Street (pictured), Robinson Road, Shenton Way, Anson Road and Tanjong Pagar areas are those earmarked for the CBD Incentive Scheme (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Biggest Beneficiaries? CBREs Armstrong estimates that there are about 20 developments in the CBD that could qualify for the CBD Incentive Scheme. These buildings owners will be motivated to explore the possibilities of triggering the bonus plot ratio or to put up their properties for sale with a bonus plot ratio scheme, he says. However, the new use will need to be either hotel or residential, and remains marred by measures and a looming supply in the next few years. In addition, these buildings still currently enjoy relatively high occupancies, limiting the need for any huge capital expenditure and revenue downtime for redevelopment. Of the three areas earmarked for rejuvenation within the CBD, Steven Ming, managing director of Sakal Real Estate Partners -- a real estate investment advisory and brokerage practice -- is of the view that those around Anson Road are the biggest beneficiaries of the schemes. This is because the minimum threshold for plot size is lower, at 1,000 sqm, he explains. Many of the buildings are already of this size and the building owners could benefit from land intensification independently. The Cecil Street, Robinson Road, Shenton Way and Tanjong Pagar areas have a higher threshold in terms of site area minimum of 1,000 sqm for corner plots and 2,000 sqm for the others and hence, pose some challenges for owners. A number of them are sitting on relatively small sites of less than 2,000 sqm and that will mean having to amalgamate with a neighbouring site to enjoy the uplift in gross plot ratio, adds Ming. The biggest challenge will be for owners of adjacent sites to agree on a valuation for two adjoining sites of different lease tenures, especially if one is 99-year, while the other is 999-year or freehold. Sector 16, which is the CBD area including Cantonment Road, Chinatown area, McCallum Street and Tanjong Pagar, saw hotel DC rates for hotel use hit $15,400 psm ($1,431 psf) compared to commercial use, which stands at $12,250 psm ($1,138 psf) and $9,900 psm for non-landed residential use (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Ming sees the anticipated benefits from increased plot ratio for redevelopment into residential, mixed-use or hotel use under the CBD Incentive Scheme negated for now by the higher development charge rates, especially for conversion to hotel use. The latest revision of development charge (DC) rates for the six-month period from March to Aug 31, 2019, saw a hike of 45.6% on average for conversion of buildings to hotel use. Meanwhile, for conversion to commercial use, the average increase in DC rates is 9.8% over the same period. This means that in Sector 16, which is the CBD area including Cantonment Road, Chinatown area, McCallum Street and Tanjong Pagar, the DC rate for hotel use is $15,400 psm ($1,431 psf) compared to redevelopment for commercial use, which is $12,250 psm ($1,138 psf) and for non-landed residential use, $9,800 psm ($910 psf). In the near-term, the immediate beneficiaries are likely to be single-asset owners on pocket sites who undertake the redevelopment of their own buildings, says Shaun Poh, Cushman & Wakefield (C&W) executive director of capital markets. Realty Centre, where 80% of the owners have agreed to a lower reserve price of $148 million ($2,441 psf ppr) for a collective sale for redevelopment into a new commercial project (Credit: Cushman & Wakefield) Commercial collective sale hopefuls However, owners of strata-titled, ageing commercial buildings see the schemes as an opportunity to cash out on their investments, says CBREs Armstrong. However, there are still some challenges to be overcome, such as smaller older buildings that may fail the requirements for the land size. At Realty Centre on Enggor Street, a commercial building built in 1974, strata-titled owners were very excited when the new CBD Incentive Scheme was rolled out, says C&Ws Poh. The existing building, which is predominantly for office use, sits on a site area of 1,021.9 sq m (about 11,000 sq ft). It is located within the Anson area, and therefore, will benefit from the uplift in GPR from redevelopment into residential, mixed-use with residential or hotel use. C&W is the marketing agency for Realty Centre, which was launched for collective sale in January. As it was before the Draft Master Plan 2019 was unveiled, the redevelopment potential was based on the 2014 Master Plan. It was therefore zoned for commercial use with a maximum height of 35 storeys, and approved for a new commercial development with a plot ratio of 5.396 and gross floor area (GFA) of 59,355 sq ft. Shenton Way where many of the old buildings have been redeveloped over the years (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) The asking price of Realty Centre was $165 million then, which worked out to a land rate of $2,714 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr), inclusive of an estimated development charge of $2.188 million. The tender closed on Feb 21. There was a price gap when we put it up for collective sale and were trying to bridge that gap, says Poh. There has been renewed interest from potential buyers since the Master Plan 2019 was announced, concedes Poh. A lot of the interest for Realty Centre has come from corporate and business owners looking to redevelop the building for their own use, he adds. Early this month, C&W obtained a new mandate to lower the reserve price to $148 million, and has obtained agreement from 80% of the owners of Realty Centre to do so. The land rate therefore has been adjusted to $2,441 psf ppr, inclusive of the DC rate of $2.334 million for commercial redevelopment. 'Window of opportunity' The strata-titled owners of Realty Centre are not the only collective sale hopefuls who see the upside in plot ratio as a bonus, and therefore, reckon they could command a higher price. There are others who are also exploring the possibility of a collective sale. A strata-titled mixed-use development, International Plaza, built in 1970, is said to be exploring a collective sale (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) As consultants, we need to manage these expectations, says Ong Choon Fah, CEO of Edmund Tie & Co (ET&Co). En bloc is not something that can happen overnight. Some of the owners use their commercial units as their place of business, and therefore, it goes beyond real estate. So, it is more difficult to persuade them to sell. Word on the street is that the owners of International Plaza on Anson Road, a mixed-use, strata-titled development built in 1970, have appointed a property consultant to advise them on the collective sale process. Given its location on Anson Road, they are also likely to benefit from the CBD Incentive Scheme for the Robinson Road, Shenton Way and Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood. Along Shenton Way, Shenton House is said to have made a third attempt at a collective sale in late 2018. The strata-titled owners in the mixed-use development are in the midst of securing 80% consensus for a collective sale. Strata-titled, mixed-use developments in the CBD built in the late 1960s and early 1970s included Shenton House and International Plaza. In the old days, even the carpark is a strata-titled lot, says ET&Cos Ong. Apportionment of proceeds that is acceptable to all the owners of a mixed-use development where shops, offices, residential units and carpark space have different share values -- is always very tricky. One Shenton (left) is a redevelopment of the former Robina House, while at Shenton House, built in 1969, strata-titled owners of the mixed-use development recently made its third collective sale attempt late last year (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Norman Ho, deputy director of corporate real estate at law firm Rajah & Tann, has also been fielding inquiries from building owners due to the CBD Incentive Scheme. Owners of such buildings are also asking for very high prices and such sites will also attract high DC rates. No doubt, elevator chats among the owners of strata-titled commercial and mixed-use developments in the CBD will heighten, says Sakals Ming. Some might see this as a rare window of opportunity to secure a better price for their property. Mixed-use Disrict URAs overarching aim to reposition the CBD as a 24/7 mixed-use district so that the CBD will not only be a place to work, but also a vibrant place to live and play, is not new, say property consultants. The government has been encouraging inner city living and mixed-use development with both commercial and residential components since the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the government first launched the government land sales (GLS) programme in the CBD, recounts Tan Tiong Cheng, senior advisor of Knight Frank Asia Pacific. The former Shing Kwang House and an adjacent building at Shenton Way were redeveloped into the present-day SGX Centre (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) One of the first such buildings was the formerRobina House developed by the late Robin SK Loh, an Indonesian-born Singaporean businessman and real estate developer. Lohs penthouse at Robina House was the only one that came with its own bowling alley, relates Tan. Robina House has since been redeveloped intoOne Shenton, a 341-unit, twin tower condo development by City Developments and completed in 2011. Meanwhile, another tycoon, SP Tao, the founder of Shing Kwan Group, whose businesses include commodities, real estate and shipping, had his penthouse at the former Shing Kwang House at Shenton Way. It was redeveloped together with the adjacent building into the present-day SGX Centre. To redevelop or not to redevelop? It was around 2005-2010 that there was a spate of redevelopment and conversion of old office buildings to residential towers. For instance, the former VTB Building on Robinson Road has been redeveloped into the newRobinson Suites; the former HMC Building on Mistri Road has been turned intoLumiere; while76 Shentonis a redevelopment of the former Hong Leong House. The former HMC Building has been redeveloped into Lumiere, a residential tower with commercial units on the first level (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Meanwhile,EON Shenton, a mixed-use scheme with strata commercial space and residential units, is a redevelopment of the former Marina House. UIC Building was also redeveloped into a new 23-storey office block of the same name and a new 54-storey residential tower with 510 units calledV on Shenton. In 2011, there were some applications for office buildings to be converted to residential development that were turned down by the URA. These includedCecil Courton Cecil Street andFuji Xerox Towers. There were also some buildings where applications for conversion from commercial to residential use were approved by URA, but where the owners did not proceed. These included the formerChow House, which has since been redeveloped into the new commercial building, Crowne at Robinson, and two adjoining office blocks at 137 and 139 Cecil Street, formerly known asAviva BuildingandCecil Houserespectively. The buildings have changed hands several times over the past decade. The 16-storey commercial building at 139 Cecil Street (right) is on the market for $218 million (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) In 2010, SE Cheong, the previous owner of both 137 and 139 Cecil Street, had secured provisional permission from URA to redevelop the two office blocks into a new residential project with 227 apartments. However, he did not proceed with redevelopment. The office building at 137 Cecil Street is now owned by the Zhou family of Shanghai Hengda Group, which therefore renamed itHengda Building. Meanwhile, 139 Cecil Street has been put on the market by the owner, a joint venture between Vibrant Group and DB2 Group. The asking price of the building is $218 million, and is jointly marketed by JLL and CBRE. The former 11-storey building at 139 Cecil Street has been extensively refurbished and is now a new 16-storey office building with a restaurant on the first level and a roof terrace with swimming pool on the topmost level. The building is 100% leased to aHong Kong co-working operator Campfire, which will take up a total area of 85,000 sq ft when the building is completed sometime in 3Q2019. The prevailing concern is the dearth of new office supply over the next two to three years, which is putting pressure on office rents.(Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Office still the flavour of the month With major changes in demographics and lifestyles, URAs efforts to bring more life in the CBD is encouraging, says Knight Franks Tan. It is in the right direction although at the moment, the office market is the hottest sector. In fact, the prevailing concern is the dearth of new office supply over the next two to three years, which is putting pressure on office rents. According to CBRE Research,Grade-A Core CBD monthly office rents in 1Q2019 grew 3.2%q-o-q to $11.15 psf. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of rent growth, bringing rents to 24.6% higher than the last trough back in 2017. A small but growing number of corporates have been exploring enterprise solutions offered by co-working providers, says CBREs Armstrong. However, its still early days and we do not see a significant threat to traditional office demand at this point. What the draft Master Plan 2019 has done, however, is to put a certain basket of properties in the spotlight, says Armstrong. ET&Cos Ong agrees. Its clear that the URA master plan is not intended to be for the short-term, she adds. It is a rejuvenation process that will evolve over time to avoid an office crunch."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The 78,152 sq ft site houses 492 commercial units across six floors and two basement levels.Mr Vikas Gupta, chairman of the collective sales committee, believes the site can be better used.\"(It is) currently heavily underutilised and the strata system does not allow Sim Lim Square to utilise the spare space,\" he said. \"It's the ideal time to refresh Sim Lim Square.\"The last gross floor area figure approved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is 391,000 sq ft, according to the SLP Scotia statement. The site is also zoned for commercial use with a plot ratio of 4.2, it added.\"Interested developers could explore converting Sim Lim Square to other uses, taking advantage of the latest URA incentive scheme, the Strategic Development Incentive scheme,\" said SLP Scotia.The scheme, announced during last month's launch of the Draft Master Plan, is intended to encourage the redevelopment of older buildings in strategic areas into new, bold and innovative developments that will positively transform the surrounding urban environment.SLP Scotia added that while the scheme is intended for the amalgamation of different plots of land, it is confident that an exception can be granted for the Sim Lim Square site as it is large enough.Industry observer Sing Tien Foo, associate professor at the National University of Singapore's real estate department, said the $1.25 billion price tag, which translates to $3,197 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr), is on the high side.The collective sale attempt also comes amid a challenging time in the market, he added.However, he noted Sim Lim Square's unique location and proximity to the Civic District as well as places like Tekka and Kallang, which are undergoing transformation.\"The development can be an interesting focal point for the area. There's some potential but the developer will really have to intensify the land use,\" he said, adding that one way to do this is to have a mixed-use project to optimise rental.The collective sale bid comes on the back of the transaction of freehold Golden Wall Centre, also in Rochor. The site was sold for $276.2 million ($2,331 psf ppr) last November.The Sim Lim Square tender will close at 3pm on June 24."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Lerida Pte Ltd was the developer of Laurel Tree, a 70-unit condo in Hillview Terrace. Both developers are linked to Tan Hock Keng, a former known property player and one of the \"Geylang Kings\" before the Asian Financial Crisis wiped out his property portfolio.The two freehold projects were supposed to have received their Temporary Occupancy Permit (TOP) in 2016.To make matters worse, not only are the developments unfinished, the project accounts - where buyers' payments are meant to be safeguarded when they buy from licensed developers - are empty.In Singapore, the monies received by a licensed developer are governed by the Housing Developers (Project Account) rules, which stipulate the very restricted terms and conditions under which a paramount mortgagee may release the funds in the project account. Withdrawal of funds allowed under the rules include for the purpose of paying construction costs, architect's fees and property tax for the housing project.A developer has to open a project account to ensure that buyers' monies collected and any loans disbursed for the construction of the building project are deposited into the project account and used specifically for the housing project.\"The financial institution, with whom the project account is maintained, is required to ensure that any withdrawal of funds from the project account is in compliance with the rules and supported by relevant documentation,\" the URA spokesman said.URA would not comment if there is a need to tighten the project account rules as the Controller of Housing (COH) is examining the project accounts of both Laurel Tree and Sycamore Tree developments to ascertain if there are any breaches of the statutory rules regulating the operations of the project accounts. Any breach of the regulations governing the operations of the project accounts is an offence, and offenders may be fined up to S$50,000 and/or imprisoned up to 1 year upon conviction.On why the COH did not step in when the developers missed the Dec 29, 2016 TOP, or anytime within the last two years, the URA spokesman said: \"The COH received feedback from some purchasers in 2017 and 2018 regarding the delay in the completion of the projects. We explained to the purchasers their contractual rights under the Sale and Purchase Agreement, which they can pursue with the developer. We also reached out to the developers and asked that they update the purchasers on the progress of the projects.\"To-date, the Housing Developers (Control & Licensing) Act serves to safeguard the interests of buyers of uncompleted private residential properties by ensuring proper sales process and fair contract terms by the developers.Justin Yip, Partner, Restructuring and Insolvency, at Withers KhattarWong, said buyers will have contractual rights against the developer based on the sale and purchase agreement, such as to claim liquidated damages for the developer's failure to fulfil the timelines committed to.\"Given however that a developer under receivership is typically insolvent and buyers rank as unsecured creditors, the recoverability of such claims may be limited,\" Mr Yip said.\"Buyers may be better off holding on to their proprietary rights and wait for the development to complete, rather than to rescind the agreement with the developer and pursue an unsecured claim against an insolvent entity,\" he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It is a regional hub for R&D (research and development) and services, and is the world's top destination for foreign direct investment in high-tech industries, said JLL's Innovation Geographies report.\"Targeting innovative cities has now become an explicit part of investment strategies. This is partly because innovation-centric cities appear to be more resilient to economic shocks,\" said Tay Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy at JLL Singapore. \"For example, tech-savvy cities such as Seoul, Berlin and Chicago, saw average real estate capital values fall less and bounce back more quickly.\"Over US$10 billion has been invested over the last three years in sectors ranging from software design to semiconductor manufacturing. Global tech companies such as Google and Facebook have established regional operations in the city, with over US$10 billion of venture capital invested in local startups over the same period, said JLL.Talent-wise, Singapore has fallen out of JLL's top 20 talent hotspots, mainly due to the drag of a slow growing \"engine room\" population, that is, those in the 20-40 years cohort.Singapore scored well on other talent attributes such as its well-educated workforce, the presence of three world-class universities and an above-average proportion of the workforce employed in high-tech industries.Ms Tay said the study reinforces JLL's optimism for Singapore property investment and office markets to stay vibrant in the short to medium-term, barring adverse external shocks.On the other hand, she noted that competition is heating up and many cities are making rapid progress towards developing sophisticated future-looking business ecosystems.\"Singapore must not rest on its laurels, but instead strive to stay ahead of the competition by continuing to nurture an innovative culture, for example through allocating a higher budget for research and development,\" she said.Elaborating further on the innovation-property connection, JLL said innovation ecosystems within cities are key to driving productivity and in turn lead to economic growth and, by implication, demand for real estate, particularly when combined with a high concentration of human capital.This relationship has been endorsed by a wide array of organisations including the European Central Bank and the World Bank, added JLL.Megan Walters, JLL's head of Asia-Pacific research, said innovation helps cities to attract investors and companies: \"Investors tend to focus on locations that are capable of sustaining long-term occupier demand, while corporates are drawn to those that have sophisticated innovation ecosystems and deep talent pools to ensure they are well-placed to succeed in the global marketplace.\"The report looked at factors such as investment in high-tech industries, research and development expenditure and talent pool. Of the 109 cities analysed, the seven leading Asia-Pacific cities - Tokyo, Singapore, Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Sydney - accounted for more than 50 per cent of total annual real estate investment volumes over the past decade in the region."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Prominent projects include JTC Bedok Food City, which has a total Gross Floor Area of more than one million sq ft and is slated for completion in early 2020. An integrated Halal Food Hub in the West region that spans 600,000 sqft that was proposed by Elite Partners Capital and the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry in May 2019 as part of efforts to enhance Singapores halal industry, is also expected to be ready in two years. The project costs around $80m-100m.

We expect demand to lag behind supply in 2019-2020 but still remain sustained driven by rising popularity of food delivery services and e-commerce, the need of F&B operators to streamline their retail spaces as well as the governments push for greater productivity and innovation in Singapores food industry, Tricia Song, head of research at Colliers International said in a statement.Also read: Foodtech slowly devours startup funding in Singapore Located mostly in North and West regions and typically within various JTC Food Zones, food factories range from as little as 3,000 sq ft in older premises and up to 40,000 sq ft in new buildings.

Colliers forecasts that food factories with 30-year land tenures are able to offer yields of about 6-7%, compared to 3.25-3.65% for office properties, and 4.4-4.9% for retail properties. Demand for food factories and central kitchens in the country has risen over the years, with a focus on major food zones in the east, north-east and central regions, the report states. A total of 637,115 sq ft of food factory space (equivalent to 1-2% of current food factory stock) has come into supply in 2019 to date, a surge from the 31,431 sq ft completed in the whole of 2018. Source: Colliers Factory rents and prices in major food zones in the east, north-east and central regions have outperformed the west and north regions, based on JTC data, according to the report. Colliers believes that this is due to their close proximity to the city centre or residential estates, which facilitates food catering and delivery services. However, in established food zones in the west region (Pandan Loop, Jalan Tepong) monthly rents can range from $1.50-2.40 psf, while those in the north region (Senoko Avenue, Mandai Link) can fetch $1.80-2.40 psf. Mature food manufacturing areas such as MacPherson, Pandan Loop and Bedok North are able to maintain occupancy between 80% and 100%, reveals the report. Meanwhile, those in newer and further-off locations, such as Tuas and Senoko, tend to have occupancies of around 60%. Colliers also found that well-located food factories with better facilities such as freezers can fetch about 25-35% higher prices than others. In March 2017, US-based PGIM Real Estate acquired 1 Buroh Lane, a cold store food distribution centre, at $300 psf, Collier highlights. In March 2019, WTT Trading divested its food factory with a cold store at 3 Mandai Link for $325 psf. The increased demand and rents in the F&B industry reflect the Singapore governments push to raise productivity and cut reliance on manpower, as outlined in the Food Manufacturing Industry Transformation Map rolled out in November 2016. The plan includes developing quick models like ready-to-eat meals, promoting adoption of manpower-lean tech, equipping employees with new skills, and expanding the reach of Singapores F&B companies globally. Source: Colliers Upcoming supply An upcoming 3.68 million sq ft of food factory space (9-10% of current food factory stock) is expected to come into supply, concentrated in the north, east and west regions. Of that, 80% is scheduled to be completed in 2019-2020. The largest upcoming project, JTC Bedok Food City, has a total gross floor area of more than 1 million sq ft, and is slated for completion in early 2020, notes Colliers. An integrated Halal Food Hub of 600,000 sq ft is also expected to be completed in two years, at a cost of $80 million-100 million. This was proposed this May by Elite Partners Capital and the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry to position Singapore at the forefront of innovation in the regions halal industry. Overall, Colliers forecasts demand to lag behind supply in 2019-2020. Demand, however, will be sustained by the rise of popularity of food delivery services and e-commerce Foodpanda and Deliveroo started their central kitchens in the last two years; the need of F&B operators to streamline retail spaces; and the governments push for greater productivity and innovation in F&B, it says. Meanwhile, rents and prices of food factories are expected to remain largely stable over the next three to five years, it adds."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

For now, C&W ranks third among the global real estate advisory firms. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in August 2018, it had a market capitalisation of US$3.86 billion ($5.27 billion) as at June 11, with FY2018 annual revenue of US$8.22 billion. The worlds biggest and second biggest corporate real estate advisory firms today are CBRE and JLL respectively. The NYSE-listed CBRE had a market cap of US$16.71 billion at June 11, with annual revenue of US$21.34 billion as at end-FY2018. The NYSE-listed JLL, on the other hand, had a market cap of US$6.10 billion at June 11, with annual revenue of US$16.32 billion as at end-FY2018. Yeo: We are ready to compete in the premier league and become the top real estate services firm in the region (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) In 1Q2019, CBREs total fee revenue made up US$2.43 billion. Meanwhile, at JLL, fee revenue for 1Q2019 was US$1.32 billion. Over the same three-month period from January to March, C&Ws total fee revenue was US$1.37 billion. The biggest contributor to fee revenue for C&W in 1Q2019 was property and facility management at US$707 million or 51.5% of the total. Leasing contributed US$373 million (27.2%), followed by capital markets with US$191 million (13.9%). The Asia-Pacific region accounted for US$251 million (18.3%) of C&Ws fee revenue in 1Q2019, and was second only to the Americas, which contributed US$937 million (68.3%). EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) generated US$184 million or 13.4% of total fees in 1Q2019. Untapped potential At C&W, Yeos focus is on growing the transactional business, namely leasing and capital markets, both in Singapore and Southeast Asia. He intends to position Singapore as the centre of excellence for the region in terms of leasing, sales and capital markets. He is also looking at extending the scope and strengths of C&W Services integrated facility services, engineering solutions and energy management to a wider client base across multiple sectors. Prior to joining C&W, Yeo was the managing director for industrial and logistics at CBRE since September 2015. Before that, he had spent 22 years at Colliers International, where he occupied a number of key positions, from country head for Singapore to executive committee member of Colliers Asia leadership and head of Asia for capital markets, investment services and industrial services. I thought I would probably retire in Colliers as I had spent 22 years there, says Yeo, who is in his mid-50s. But I found my way to CBRE, where I was looking after the industrial and logistics business for Asia. At C&W, what excites him is the untapped potential. Says Yeo: As a full-service real estate company with a regional and global platform, we are well-positioned to offer services and solutions at every point of the real estate cycle. He sees opportunity in competing across the entire real estate services platform be it in brokerage, project and development services or facilities management. The growth trajectory for our business is strong, adds Yeo. Significant capital market deals brokered by C&W included the sale of Ascott Raffles Place Singapore for $353.3 million in January 2019 Capital market deals In Singapore, significant capital market deals brokered by C&W included the sale of Ascott Raffles Place Singapore for $353.3 million in January 2019. C&Ws capital markets team led by executive director Shaun Poh acted on behalf of the seller, Ascott Residence Trust Management. The buyer of Ascott Raffles Place was Cheong Sim Lam or SL Cheong, the developer of several residential projects, including Robinson Suites on Robinson Road. He previously owned 137 and 139 Cecil Street. C&W also brokered the sale of the office development at 7 and 9 Tampines Grande to a joint venture between Evia Real Estate and Metro Holdings for $395 million in mid-April, followed by the sale of Realty Centre for $148 million a few days later. Realty Centre marked the first commercial collective sale in 2019, and the property was sold to Singapore-listed The Place Holdings. If we can harness the capabilities of our Singapore capital markets team with our regional and global infrastructure, it will be very powerful because Singapore is a huge base for outbound capital, says Yeo. He points to the likes of ARA Asset Management, Ascendas-Singbridge and CapitaLand, Frasers Property, GIC and Temasek Holdings as Singapore-based entities which have been aggressively acquiring real estate assets and portfolios around the world. These are some of our clients and its a great opportunity for our capital markets team, Yeo adds. Market consolidation Consolidation has been taking place in the real estate services industry, with 12 major merger and acquisition (M&A) deals across the globe in the span of 16 years from 2002 to 2018. (See chart below.) M&A deals over the years: 2002-2018 Credit: 2019 CBRE Investor Day Presentation, April 2019 Even the C&W of today is the result of an M&A between the firm and DTZ in a deal completed in September 2015. With consolidation, movement of top executives among the real estate advisory firms has been rampant. Yeo, for instance, replaced former C&W managing director for Singapore, Stephen Saul, who left in 2018 and has since retired. He assumed the position in February 2016. Saul is said to have over 30 years experience in the real estate industry, and was previously with JLL, where he was managing director for Korea and New Zealand. Saul in turn had replaced Toby Dodd, the previous managing director for C&W Singapore, following the latters appointment as C&Ws executive managing director of account management for the Tri-State and East Regions in the Americas for Global Occupier Services (GOS). The GOS business at C&W, whose Asia-Pacific team is based in Singapore, provides advice and solutions to global and regional MNCs across the entire real estate spectrum including transaction management, facilities management and workplace strategy. In May, C&W announced the appointment of Cameron Ahrens as head of integrated facilities management (IFM) for Asia-Pacific. Prior to joining C&W, Ahrens was with Brookfield Global Integrated Services (BGIS) where he was head of facilities management for Asia. Before that, Ahrens had held senior positions in the occupier business at CBRE and JLL respectively. Our regional GOS team partners with MNC occupier clients where C&W is the preferred or sole provider for their real estate needs across multiple markets, whether its integrated portfolio management or providing advice on their relocation or expansion on a regional or global platform, says Yeo. These global and regional accounts provide downstream business for C&Ws local offices, such as the leasing of commercial or industrial space as well as sale of these spaces. Realty Centre marked the first commercial collective sale in 2019, and the property was sold to Singapore-listed The Place Holdings (Credit: C&W) Developing the hunter instinct Beyond relying on GOS to push business to the Singapore and other regional offices, Yeo believes it is important to hunt for business ourselves in order to grow the transaction business. He is interested in growing the cross-border business, particularly from Chinese manufacturing companies looking to relocate their factories in Vietnam or other markets in Southeast Asia. Thats my passion, says Yeo. During his tenure at Colliers, he turned the international firm into a leading consultancy in the industrial sector in Singapore. In July 2015, CBRE recruited five of Colliers industrial services team, including Brenda Ong who is now CBREs executive director for advisory and transaction services industrial and logistics. In February 2015, a group of three from Colliers office tenant representation team led by Marcus Loo left for Savills. Loo was appointed CEO of Savills Singapore in January this year. Yeo is proud of the talent that he has groomed during his career as a real estate professional. The business is all about hunting, pitching and winning, and ensuring our clients receive the best service and solution, he says. He wants to develop and sharpen that hunter instinct in the transaction business teams in C&W in Singapore and the region. Research and analysis have also become an important competitive tool in the industry. C&W beefed up its Asia-Pacific research team with two new appointments announced on June 11. James Shepherd, previously C&Ws managing director research, for Greater China, will take on the role of head of research for Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, Dominic Brown will assume the role of head of insight and analysis for Asia-Pacific. Having been in the industry for close to 30 years, Yeo believes in looking after our people - the key pillars of our business. He adds: We are a service business and it is critical that we continue to provide a conducive and engaging environment so our people stay passionate and committed to delivering their best, which then translates into better outcomes for them, our clients and our business."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It has a 999-year lease tenure and occupies a land area of 2,083 sq ft and a total floor area of 5,640 sq ft, said the exclusive marketing agent JLL on Monday morning.The indicative price works out to around $4,078 per sq ft of total floor area, according to The Business Times' calculations.Its neighbouring unit, 64 Club Street, was sold late last year for $21.8 million, brokered by JLL. The price for the 999-year leasehold shophouse works out to $3,880 per sq ft. The buyer was a Singapore-incorporated company controlled by members of Hong Kong's Chan family.The shophouse is nestled in the elevated cul-de-sac of Club Street, within the Telok Ayer Conservation Area. It is also directly opposite the Chinese Weekly Entertainment Club, a private millionaire's club with a history dating back to 1891, JLL said.The property was previously withdrawn from the market after the handful of offers received had fallen short of the vendor's expectation, said Mr Clemence Lee, senior director of capital markets at JLL. The first sale attempt was in November 2018, he told BT.\"With the limited number of quality shophouse offerings available in the market now, we feel that this is a good time to relaunch the property to give buyers a chance to relook at this outstanding opportunity,\" Mr Lee said on Monday.65 Club Street sits on land zoned for commercial use, which means foreigners are eligible to purchase it. There is also no additional buyer's stamp duty or seller's stamp duty imposed on the purchase.The shophouse is currently owner-occupied and will be sold with vacant possession.It is owned by JerryTan Residential (JTResi), JLL told BT on Monday. JTResi is a boutique luxury property consultancy founded by real estate magnates Jerry Tan and Jason Tan. Mr Jerry Tan was said to have purchased 65 Club Street in 2006 for $2.8 million, according to local media reports.It has since undergone a $1.2 million refurbishment. The first storey features a private entertainment area with a wine bar, dining area and a showroom, while the upper floors are being used as an office and art gallery.\"It is a perfect trophy asset which will appeal to a wide range of owner occupiers including family offices, wealth management companies or boutique financial firms among others. We are confident that the asset will receive strong interest during the marketing exercise,\" Mr Lee said.The public tender exercise for the public tender closes on July 31 at 3pm.Separately, three adjoining corner shophouses in Little India were also launched for sale on Monday with a reserve price of $11 million by Cushman & Wakefield.

Beyond that, there are many opportunities to collaborate across Asean, which will increasingly become an important manufacturing base for companies from elsewhere, said Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) assistant managing director Lim Kok Kiang.One role Singapore could play is in exporting its model for the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Cluster (Namic), which helps to link up industry, research and public agencies for AM projects, said Namic managing director Ho Chaw Sing. The city can also serve as a test bed for showcase projects, curating partners for large initiatives that will demonstrate the value of AM, he added.Another possibility is for Singapore to take a position as a service centre for the region, said panellist Sastry Kandukuri, global AM lead at risk management and quality assurance services provider DNV GL.As more manufacturing activities move to neighbouring countries, Singapore can support the rise of AM in the region by being Asean's knowledge centre or design hub, providing services such as product development and research, added Dr Ho.Thyssenkrupp's white paper on the potential of AM in Asean, launched that day, estimates that the technology could also create three to four million jobs in Asean by 2030, and reduce the region's imports by US$30 billion to US$50 billion. Though Asia-Pacific represents about 30 per cent of the global AM market, Asean accounts for only 5 to 7 per cent of Asia-Pacific AM spending.The event also marked the official launch of Thyssenkrupp's AM TechCenter Hub in Singapore, which will serve as the regional hub for the company's existing Mlheim TechCenter in Germany. It will focus on AM solutions in metal and plastic technologies for customers in marine and offshore, automotive, cement, chemical, mining and other heavy industries.Starting off within Thyssenkrupp's Singapore office, headed by a newly hired head of AM in Singapore, the TechCenter will be gradually built up over time based on customer needs, said a Thyssenkrupp spokesman.The TechCenter is supported by the EDB, following the signing of a memorandum of agreement in April at the Hannover Messe trade show."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Market watchers attribute this to several factors, including the introduction of the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) in late 2011 at a rate of 10 per cent on foreign buyers of Singapore residential properties. In January 2013, the rate was hiked to 15 per cent before being raised further to 20 per cent last July. Because of the way Sentosa Cove had been marketed, it had historically relied more heavily on foreign buyers compared with high-end homes on the mainland. Hence many players with stakes in Sentosa Cove see ABSD as the \"killer\" for residential sales in the precinct. Says a spokesman for Hong Leong Group: \"ABSD is a significant deterrence on foreign buyers/investors. This heavy tax increase can cause potential buyers to have some second thoughts.\"The group is the parent of mainboard-listed City Developments, which was involved with developing The Oceanfront @ Sentosa Cove condo project and The Quayside Collection hotel, retail and residential mixed-use project.Other factors have also contributed to the relatively quieter property market at Cove, including the precinct's master developer winding down overseas promotional activity for the location once it had finished selling the last of the big land parcels in 2008, said observers. More on this later.First, a quick comparison of property price movements since 2010 on Sentosa Cove vis-a-vis the mainland.A recent study by List Sotheby's International Realty (List SIR) shows that the average price of condo units transacted on Sentosa Cove fell nearly one-third from S$2,325 per square foot in 2010 to S$1,560 psf last year.In contrast, over the same period, the average transacted price for units in a basket of 22 comparable non-landed projects in prime districts 9 and 10 on the mainland rose 14.1 per cent from S$2,422 psf in 2010 to S$2,764 psf in 2018.As a result, the average price for the district 9 and 10 basket was 77 per cent higher than that for Sentosa Cove last year. Back in 2010, the gap was just 4 per cent.(The developments in the district 9 and 10 basket have similar attributes - such as quality of finishes, age, project size as well as unit sizes - as the nine launched condo projects on Sentosa Cove. All these developments were launched around the same time, that is, between 2004 and 2010. While the Sentosa Cove condo projects were developed on sites with 99-year leasehold tenures, all but one of the 22 projects in the district 9/10 basket are freehold.)In the landed housing segment, List SIR compared bungalow sales on Cove against those in Good Class Bungalow (GCB) Areas on the mainland. The finding was that the average price for Sentosa Cove villas shrank 10.6 per cent from S$1,910 psf on land area in 2010 to S$1,707 psf last year.On the other hand, prices in GCB Areas increased 37.5 per cent over the same period, from S$1,102 psf to S$1,515 psf.The higher psf price on Sentosa Cove, despite 99-year leasehold tenures compared to predominantly superior freehold tenure in GCB Areas, is due partly to the fact that bungalows in Cove are mostly on smaller land plots averaging around 9,000 sq ft; in GCB Areas, the minimum plot size is typically 15,070 sq ft, with many plots much bigger than this.The volume of sales in GCB Areas has fallen at a slower clip than for Sentosa Cove bungalows.Last year, 11 villas were sold in Cove, about a fifth of the 54 deals in 2010. The number of bungalows transacted in GCB Areas has also eased, albeit at a slower pace: the 42 deals last year is 35 per cent of the 120 deals a decade earlier.Fast track to luxuryThe first Sentosa Cove residence was completed in 2006 and today, the precinct is home to more than 2,000 properties, of which about 20 per cent are landed homes and 80 per cent are condominium units, according to a spokesman for Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC). There are over 6,000 residents living in the precinct, which also has a marina, a hotel and F&B/retail outlets.Sentosa Cove was built on a 117-hectare stretch of mostly reclaimed land on the eastern coast of Sentosa Island. Reclamation began in stages in the 1970s. With the reclamation and excavation works completed in the mid-1990s, five islets had been carved out of the reclaimed land along with a network of canals.Sentosa Cove Pte Ltd (SCPL) was set up as a subsidiary of SDC in 1995 to master plan the precinct and market land parcels for sale, among other things.SCPL launched its first land parcels for sale in 2003, marking the start of a new chapter in luxury living in Singapore with homes allowed to be built on the waterfront. The precinct was pitched to foreigners and hence, was more dependent on foreign buyers compared with plush residences on the mainland.Singapore has restrictions on the purchase of landed residential property by foreigners. However, to attract international talent and high net worth personalities to have a stake in Singapore, a special arrangement was made at Sentosa Cove, where foreign individuals were allowed to buy either a completed landed home or land parcels for development into their home on Sentosa Cove. However, the landed property has to be for owner occupation and a foreigner may own no more than one so-called restricted property in Singapore. Foreign buyers still need the government's nod but fast-tracked approval within 48 hours was provided.To promote the sale of sites in the waterfront housing precinct, SCPL engaged in an international marketing blitz, showcasing the precinct at prominent luxury residential property events in places such as Shanghai, Monte Carlo and London. This went hand-in-hand with an international advertising campaign that put forward the Cove as \"the world's most desirable address\", as mentioned in a coffee table book Sentosa Cove published in 2009 by Editions Didier Millet.A developer told BT that prior to the 2008 global crisis, at least half of those who bought units in its condo projects on Sentosa Cove were foreigners (including Singapore permanent residents), compared with 20 to 30 per cent for high-end condo launches on the mainland around the same time. \"The target market for Singaporean buyers on Cove is smaller because of reasons such as the lack of proximity to schools.\"A wave of foreign buyers that recededDuring the global crisis, the Singapore residential market tanked.However activity quickly began to recover in 2009 and 2010, aided by the low interest rate environment. The era of quantitative easing and global equity sent foreign investors to Singapore's shores. List SIR's analysis showed that sales volumes of condo units rebounded in 2009 and 2010 at both Sentosa Cove and for projects in the district 9 and 10 basket on the mainland.As a result, prices rose in 2010.In that year, the average condo price in the district 9 and 10 basket rose 12 per cent, while the average condo price in Sentosa Cove shot up 32 per cent - resulting in the 4 per cent price gap in 2010. Besides the heightened awareness of Sentosa Cove among overseas investors, the opening of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) integrated resort in 2010, could also have caused the strong price appreciation in the Cove, said List SIR.To stem the flow of excessive foreign monies into the Singapore property market and prevent a bubble, the authorities unleashed a series of cooling measures from 2009. This, as well as a slowing economy, caused sales volume to decline in the years that followed, notes List SIR. The prohibitive ABSD rates imposed on foreign buyers hit Sentosa Cove more badly because it was more dependent on foreign money compared to districts 9 and 10, noted List SIR.In short, having high dependence on foreign buyers turned out to be a double-edged sword for the waterfront housing district.The en bloc revivalYet other factors also came into play, that did not help condo prices on Cove but benefited the projects in the district 9 and 10 basket, such as the 2017-2018 en bloc fever.From 2011 to 2015, the average condo price at Sentosa Cove eased 34 per cent to slightly above S$1,500 psf - and has remained at this level until the present.Against that, the average price in the district 9 and 10 non-landed basket saw a smaller correction of 15 per cent over the same period. For the next one and a half years, prices hovered at around S$2,400 psf, with the downward slide arrested by the revival of the collective sales of older developments in the prime districts of the mainland from mid-2017 onwards.Between June 2017 and June 2018, several en bloc sales took place in River Valley, Cairnhill, Cuscaden Road and Holland Road, with each sale setting new benchmarks for sites in the prime districts, says Han Huan Mei, List SIR's research director.\"In line with rising land prices, new projects in these locations that were launched for sale helped to reprice the existing properties.\"However, Sentosa Cove did not benefit from the enbloc fever. As it is already fully developed, there were no new projects to stimulate price growth; sales at the last condo project began in 2010,\" she adds.Beyond comparing condo prices at Sentosa Cove against the List SIR basket of comparable properties in districts 9 and 10, a seasoned industry observer highlights another reason the buoyant winds from the round of price escalation of housing on the mainland did not catch the sails of the Sentosa Cove market.\"The rapidly increasing land prices in the mainland during the 2017 and H1 2018 enbloc frenzy had propelled the volume and prices of newer apartments; these are generally more compact and affordable on an absolute-price basis.\"The older and larger apartments in Singapore did not enjoy the huge price premiums seen for the newer-generation compact units. For Sentosa Cove, SCPL had stipulated very stringent requirements on the number of units to be provided in the condo projects because of traffic considerations. Consequently, the units in Sentosa Cove were much larger than those in the mainland and therefore much less affordable because of the absolute quantum involved. This was in spite of their psf capital values being much more attractive than the newer generation high-end or mass-market housing projects on the mainland in recent years.\"Ms Han adds that the 99-year leasehold tenure of the projects on Cove also weighed down their prices. \"In comparison, all but one of the projects in the district 9/10 basket are freehold properties, and thus they can hold their value better.\"The industry observer cited another setback for developers marketing the last few condo project launches at the Cove: SCPL stopped its overseas promotional and publicity campaign for the precinct once it had sold the last major site in 2008. SCPL was dissolved in 2013, following the completion of the precinct and upon fulfilment of its role, SDC's spokesman says.The bungalow marketIt has been a familiar tale for the bungalow segment. Similar to non-landed properties, 2010 was a good year with strong volume and price recovery for both Sentosa Cove bungalows as well as in GCB Areas, as the economy rebounded as well as enjoying a boost from the opening of RWS.List SIR says that in 2009, 2010 and 2011, prior to the introduction of ABSD in December 2011, foreigners and permanent residents made up 53 to 58 per cent of bungalow buyers at the Cove.In 2014 and 2016, their share had dwindled to 50 per cent; in 2015 all the buyers were Singaporeans.In 2014, prices of Sentosa Cove bungalows fell 24 per cent year on year. While two high-priced transactions in 2015 did lift prices (up by 24 per cent), the overall low sales volume continued to put pressure on prices, resulting in a 17 per cent decline over the next two years.\"By 2017, it became clear that prices of villas at Sentosa Cove had reached the trough and were beginning to stabilise, buyers began to re-enter the market looking for fair-value buys,\" says Ms Han.On the other hand, bungalows in the GCB Areas saw a more gradual and sustainable price increase although sales volume also took a plunge in 2013 and 2014 before it began a slow recovery from 2015 onwards.\"Between Sentosa Cove and GCB Areas on the main island, the main difference is the resort and waterfront lifestyle which only Sentosa Cove offers. Astute buyers would see that now is a good opportunity to purchase a bungalow at Sentosa Cove for owner-occupation and mid- to long-term investment,\" says Ms Han.Interest is returning; Ms Han notes that 15 Sentosa Cove bungalows were sold in 2017, and another 11 in 2018, more than the four sold in each of the preceding three years. And Singaporeans accounted for 53 and 55 per cent of bungalow buyers at the Cove in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Foreign buyers seem elusive.Potential catalystsProperty agents are pinning their hopes on a few potential catalysts that could revive buying at the Cove. One could kick in when RWS's expansion plans announced earlier this year come into fruition.\"Likewise, when Keppel Land launches its residential project on Keppel Island, this could lead to a repricing of properties on Sentosa Cove,\" says Ms Han.Another stimulus for Sentosa Cove is that it is part of the upcoming Greater Southern Waterfront or GSW (stretching across Singapore's southern coastline, from Pasir Panjang to Marina East), she added.Fow now, developers with unsold properties are sticking to leasing them out.Ho Bee Land, which has developed more properties than anyone else on Sentosa Cove, is left with half of the 91 units at the Turquoise condo (first sold in 2007) and two thirds for the 151-unit Seascape (launched in 2010). It did not even launch for sale its last project in the Cove, the 302-unit Cape Royale, choosing instead to adopt a leasing-only strategy. To date, slightly more than 80 per cent of the total unsold units in these three joint-venture projects have been leased.At Cape Royale, monthly rentals range from S$6,500 for a three-bedroom apartment of 1,680 sq ft on a low floor to S$19,700 for a 3,143 sq ft four-bedder on a higher floor.Two triplex sky villas of about 8,100 and 8,200 sq ft, each with its own private pool, are also available for lease.The Hong Leong Group spokesman recalls: \"When the first land parcels at Cove went for sale in 2003, the area was positioned as one of the world's most prestigious integrated oceanfront marina residential communities and the centrepiece of Singapore's billion-dollar Master Plan for Sentosa Island. The luxury enclave was heavily marketed to foreigners and investors. Zoned as a prime living area in Singapore, it is the only area where foreign ownership of private landed residences is allowed.\"Despite the huge monetary investment, incentives and efforts that have gone into nurturing and promoting Sentosa Cove, one could argue that in recent years, the precinct has not been receiving much marketing promotion efforts to help put it back on the the radars of international investors. The vision for Sentosa Cove to become the preferred residence for those who want an island resort as their playground has not been fully realised.\"Developers and agents continue to hope that that the high ABSD rate on foreign buyers will be reduced if not removed. That may be a tall order for now.Perhaps, the authorities could be more sympathetic with another suggestion, from the Hong Leong Group spokesman: \"It may be timely to review the entrance fees into Sentosa Island as it may pose as a hindrance given the plethora of F&B offerings in the other parts of Singapore. This would make it appealing for locals and foreigners to visit the island's attractions and beaches, to enjoy staycations or dine at the establishments. Some of the local and foreign visitors may think of residing on Sentosa. These should be part of a new and more robust package to revitalise Sentosa.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

A lounge with a service bar is also located here, as well as high-speed elevators with direct access to residences.SHOPPING, DINING DESTINATIONS WITHIN REACHBeing located in the heart of the Central Business District also means that the building is in prime location for dining and shopping.Popular areas such as Duxton Hill, Club Street and Ang Siang Hillare within walking distance.

The building sits right above Tanjong Pagar MRT station, and near the sites of the upcoming Maxwell and Shenton Way stations.However, Mr Dyson may be more inclined to drive about town in one of his new electric cars, which are currently in development and which will be built in Singapore.

You can walk into a restaurant or bar and think, Im not sure I want to be here because it has no vibe, or you can walk into one thats buzzing and then struggle to get out, saysMartin Samworth, group president and CEO of advisory services for EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific at CBRE. Were trying to create ones where people want to be in; that creates value in a holistic sense. Samworth: Clients dont see borders and boundaries; they only see investment opportunities (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Having been in the real estate business for 36 years, Samworth continues to find it stimulating. What I really enjoy about it is the fact that it draws on so many aspects of life and economics, he says. Samworth, who is based in London, was in Singapore last month for the official launch of CBREs new 32,000 sq ft headquarters at Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ). Designed to showcase its vision of next-generation workplaces,CBREs premises at PLQfeature the property consultancys proprietary technology, such as Floored, to visualise and edit floor plans in 3D; Workplace 360, an approach to creating a variety of space settings that caters to different working needs; and a new mobile app, Host, which offers access to office amenities and services. Host is the glue around the business to help make things more efficient and help people save time so that they are more productive, he says. Reference point Deploying technology and design, the workplace at PLQ is a reference point for CBREs corporate clients, whether it is for creating wellness components, design, fit-out or project management. Our corporate clients are increasingly looking to reorganise their different teams or departments when their leases are up for renewal, explains Samworth. They want to know how they can create greater collaborative spaces; or new social spaces for hospitality, food and beverage offerings. All these things are becoming increasingly important in attracting and retaining key talent in the workplace. CBRE also intends to progressively roll out the Host app and the new co-working brand, Hana, says Samworth. The workspace area at CBRE's new headquarters at Paya Lebar Quarter (Credit: CBRE) Launched in late 2018 and operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE, Hana was created to help building owners develop and operate integrated scaleable, flexible workspaces. The first Hana co-working space opened in the middle of this year in the US, across three floors and more than 500,000 sq ft of Grade-A office space at the PwC Tower in Park District in Dallas, Texas. The fit-out and operating costs, as well as revenue, are shared between Hana and the buildings developers and co-owners, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co and Trammel Crow, a commercial real estate developer which is a subsidiary of CBRE. This partnership model will be replicated across multiple locations in 25 markets over the next three to four years, according to Hana in a release in February. The second Hana co-working space is scheduled to open later this year at Park Place in Irvine, California.

It was also then that Samworth was promoted to group president and CEO of advisory services for EMEA and Asia Pacific. The change took effect from Jan 1, 2019. Art mural showcasing CBRE's proprietary mobile app, Host which offers access to office amenities and services (Credit: CBRE) Samworth oversees the divisional presidents of Continental Europe, India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East & Africa, North Asia, Pacific and the UK. One of the reasons why were expanding my responsibility into the Asia-Pacific and EMEA is to make sure that the two regions are absolutely connected, says Samworth. So, for major corporates that were already working for in EMEA, we can extend the relationship into Asia-Pacific. Weve already done that for a number of companies. He adds: We also see the flow of investment capital from Asia going the other way from both local and international corporate clients. Asian outbound real estate investment had declined 36% y-o-y to US$53.8 billion ($73.2 billion) last year, butSingapore investorscontributed about 40% or US$21.6 billion. Singapore was the largest source of Asian capital in global real estate investments in 2018, said Yvonne Siew, CBRE executive director of global capital markets, Asia Pacific, in a statement in March. The top three countries for Singapore-based investors last year were: the US (US$6.4 billion), China (US$4.3 billion), and the UK (US$3.1 billion). The top three sectors they invested in were: industrial and logistics (US$7.7 billion), office (US$6.9 billion), and residential/multi-family (US$1.5 billion). The trend of Singapore investors exporting capital abroad is expected to continue in 2019, notes Siew. Clients dont see borders and boundaries; they only see investment opportunities, adds Samworth. Increasingly, corporate clients want just one service provider who can deliver the many different facets for their real estate issues. That is why CBRE has continued to broaden its offerings in facilities management and project management, with specialisation around retail, logistics, workplace environments, wellness or energy solutions, he says. Singapore was the largest source of Asian capital in global real estate investments in 2018, according to CBRE (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Outsourcing, growth of GWS Advisory services business is still the biggest contributor to CBREs fee revenue, having generated US$7.56 billion in FY2018 and US$1.6 billion in 1Q2019. The next biggest fee generator is global workplace solutions (GWS), which clocked US$2.74 billion and US$692 million in FY2018 and 1Q2019 respectively. CBRE had acquired the GWS business from Johnson Controls in 2015 for US$1.48 billion, and it has become one of the fastest-growing revenue and earnings contributors for the past two years. GWS was also the biggest source of fee revenue in 1Q2019 at 28%, followed by advisory leasing services (26%), according to CBRE. Of the US$692 million in fees generated in 1Q2019, the US contributed US$302 million, with another US$319 million from EMEA and US$70 million from the Asia-Pacific. The outsourcing business is at an embryonic stage in a number of the markets, but its quite mature now in the US and in parts of Europe, notes Samworth. In many parts of the world, our key clients are still exploring how they can use our range of services and professional staff to deliver better services and at more efficient costs whether its from a property management or facility management point of view. Thats going to be a trend that continues. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, CBRE has a market capitalisation of US$17.57 billion as at July 9. It is considered the worlds biggest commercial real estate advisory firm in terms of revenue, which stood at US$21.34 billion as at FY2018. Among the US 500 largest public companies, CBREs ranking rose to 146th in 2019 from 207th last year. The real estate advisory business has become increasingly sophisticated, notes Samworth. We employ people from banking, and we have a lot of people in property management business who have an accounting background, understand the procurement business, the physical attributes of hotels, office buildings and shopping centres, he continues. Increasingly, were also creating environments that are fulfilling for our clients."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It was also the eighth consecutive quarterly increase for this segment of the office market, climbing 3% q-o-q and 12.6% y-o-y. Tighter vacancies coupled with healthy space take-up among certain occupier segments particularly technology and flexible workspace firms continued to support rental growth in 2Q2019, says Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore at Colliers International. However, she reckons the pace of increase has likely peaked as tenants become more resistant to rent hikes. CBD Grade-A office rents grew 5.4% in 1H2019, and are on track to meet Colliers expectation of 8% for the full year. We are projecting CBD Grade-A rents to rise in 2019 and 2020, before dipping moderately in 2021 in view of new supply and potentially softer economic outlook, says Song. Overall office rents are projected to continue to moderate from the strong 15% y-o-y growth in 2018, and grow by 5% next year. In 2Q2019,rental growth was the strongest in the Beach Road/Bugis micro-market, rising by 4.6% q-o-q and 18% y-o-y to $9.18 psf pm. This was largely due to tight vacancies in office buildings in the area, and as landlords priced in the upcoming rejuvenation in the precinct, with thecompletion of Guoco Midtownin 2022 and the redevelopment of Shaw Tower slated to be ready in 2023, says Colliers Research.

The S$41.2 million property was bought by the daughter of Alan Chong, the founder of Wah Loon Engineering who earlier last year had sold most of his stake in the company to a subsidiary of Euronext Paris-listed infrastructure and construction giant Vinci SA.However, property agents believe that that record is likely to have been broken by British consumer electronics maker Dyson's founder, James Dyson, with his recent purchase of a bungalow facing the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

(Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)SINGAPORE: After the cooling measures slapped on in July 2018, many have wondered whether Singapore property remains a good investment bet.To be sure, the measures targeted speculators and hot foreign money, and aimed to cool speculative sentiments.Investing in overseas real estate is not traditionally a popular option for investors because managing foreign properties is costly and time-intensive, not to mention the risks of dealing with exchange rate fluctuations.This explains the home bias characteristic of property investments and why investors tend to invest repeatedly in local markets they are familiar with overtime. Hefty transaction costs including stamp duties, legal fees and inspections may deter many from entering into foreign markets.However, there are upsides to investing in real estate, which usually appreciates in tandem with the countrys economic growth that can hedge against inflation at the very least.Residential property, as a key pillar of Singapores social compact that gives a home-owning population a stake in the country, is also seen as stable and less volatile.It is also a familiar asset class that appeal to different investors from institutional buyers to individuals.The attractiveness of the Singapore property market also in turn attracts foreign developers wanting a slice of the pie.THE CURIOUS CASE OF CHINESE DEVELOPERS IN SINGAPORENews over the past few months have raised questions about the role of Chinese developers and investors who have been active in the Singapore property market. On the back of the Hong Kong protests, there are also anecdotal accounts of Hong Kongers exploring new homes and offices in Singapore.China developers have made in-roads into Singapores residential property market as early as 2009, on the back of the economic recovery in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.In more recent years, the spotlight has been shone on this group, especially after a plot of land at Stirling Road got snapped up for S$1.003 billion in May 2017, in a joint bid by Logan Property, a Hong Kong listed developer founded in Shantou, Guangdong, and the Nanshan Group, a conglomerate headquartered in Longkou, Shandong.They outbid the second-highest bidder, MCL Land, by S$77 million for the 21,109.5 sq m site. The final price also turned out to be an unusual S$289 million (about 29 per cent) higher than the lowest bid price.Most recently, another Chinese developer Kingsford Hurray Development acquired Normanton Park in an en bloc sale deal, also at a record-breaking S$830.1 million (excluding the estimated S$231.1 million upgrading premium to top up the lease to 99 years).Kingsford was later slapped with a no-sale restriction on the acquired site by the URAs Controller of Housing in April. They can commence construction but will not be able to sell units beforeobtaininga Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP). Concerns about construction quality might have been afoot.This greater interest in Singapore from Chinese developers is in keeping with larger trends of outbound foreign investments from China into local real estate markets. Many Chinese firms are enthusiastic to expand overseas amid a hotly competitive domestic market.Capital flows by China (inclusive of Hong Kong) into global commercial real estate were estimated at US$31.3 billion in 2017 according to Real Capital Analytics. These investments dipped by 27 per cent in 2018, but remained substantial at US$22.8 billion.Still, questions about whether aggressive land bidding strategies of Chinese developers will crowd out local developers and push up private residential housing market prices in Singapore remain.AGGRESSIVE ACQUIRING OF LANDChinese developers have been assertive in this recent land bank race, acquiring many governmentsale sites and en bloc sites.Their forays into Singapores property market have no doubt intensified competition in the local residential property market, but its useful to keep in mind this highly oligopolistic market that has been dominated by few big developers even before their entry.The top 10 largest developers took up more than 76 per cent of the market share by the private property sales between 1995 and 2009, estimated in our earlier studies with the University of Irvines Edward Coulson and University of Aucklands Dong Zhi.The question is a balance. On one hand, healthy competition improves efficiency in price discovery, curbs potential collusion in land sales and encourages competitive land bids. On the other hand, excessive speculation is undesirable, causing unsustainable upward price spirals in the private property market.As the former President of the Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore (REDAS) Augustine Tan said in 2017:Every piece of land sold sets a benchmark for the next piece of land sale. That is the concern. I fear that land prices will run to a situation that may not be healthy. We may not see it now but in few years times we will.There is evidence of such a dynamic at play.Based on Government Land Sales and en bloc data from 2009 to 2018, Chinese developers have been found to have bought land at a significant premium of 12.5 per cent relative to local developers, holding other factors such as site attributes and location characteristics constant.Facing intense pressure, local developers have counteracted with similarly aggressive acquisitions in order to retain a firm foothold in the home market.Fears of fewer land plots on the back of a bullish en bloc market may have driven local developers, such as Sim Lian, to acquire Tampines Court for S$970 million in 2017, and GuocoLand and Hong Leong Group to purchase Pacific Mansion for S$980 million in 2018.But the high-profile nature of launches by Chinese developers may have obscured a more nuanced picture. The market share of local developers has been hovering around 80 per cent based on market launches so there is little sign that cash-rich Chinese developers are crowding out local developers.This is notwithstanding that the number of condominium units sold by Chinese developers in the primary market has seen a surge in the share from 5 per cent in 2011 to 20 per cent since 2015, signifying their expanding influence in recent years.FOREIGN COMPETITIONTwo hypotheses may explain the high price premium paid by the Chinese developers.First, Chinese developers pay higher prices because of information asymmetry, due to the lack of local market knowledge. However, learning through repeated acquisitions may narrow their information disadvantages over time.Second, Chinese developers are able to keep their construction costs low, such that their profit margin remains intact after paying for high land costs.In a study with Coulson and Dong, we have found that the most experienced developers can reduce construction costs by harnessing technology and economics of scale. Material and labour costs can be kept low by reducing wastage through effective project management, and by buying material in bulk directly from source countries at lower costs.While some may have accused Chinese developers of driving up property prices, because they have been purchasing land at a premium, we have found that their new residential property launches sell at 3 per cent lower than those by local developers, controlling for property characteristics, spatial attributes and the timing of property sale.If these lower prices are the results of competition and increased development efficiency, then the entry of foreign developers into the local property market brings more good than harm to local homeowners.However, if lower prices correlate with lower housing quality, then the keen competition in prices may have led to undesirable outcomes. Developers risk damaging their reputation if they resort to lowering construction costs at the expense of shoddy workmanship and cheap material.ARE FOREIGN INVESTORS PUSHING UP PRICES?Recent news has also reported the influx of wealthy foreign investors, especially those from China, flocking to Singapore and buying up units in the luxury segment.Still, these anecdotes seem to be less representative when the data shows that the share of Chinese buyers in foreign buyer transactions in the local property market has been constantly below 4 per cent throughout the years.There was a small uptick in 2006, but this share reverted in 2013 and 2017 respectively.Additionally, foreign buyers pay a 2.7 per cent price premium relative to comparable transactions by local buyers. Aside from information disadvantage, the price differential can be explained by the greater liquidity well-heeled foreign investors have.The uptick in demand for residential property by foreign investors meanwhile have been curbed by the slew of cooling measures since December 2011, and have come under control especially after the Additional Buyers Stamp Duty revisions in 2013.A POSITIVE OUTLOOK AHEADDespite foreign competition ramping up prices in the GLS and en bloc markets, there is no evidence showing that high land costs have translated into higher prices in the private property market.As competition in Singapores property market heats up, more local developers are also extending their wings and diversifying their real estate businesses to other foreign markets. Overseas investments by Singapore-based developers have almost doubled from 2013 to 2015 compared to 2010 to 2012.The entry of foreign developers into the Singapore residential property market may have benefitted average Singaporean private homeowners. The outlook remains positive if innovation and efficiency gains, through the introduction of new smart technologies and fresh housing concepts, can be further realised.Chia Liu Ee is a researcher and Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo is the Deans Chair and the Director of Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies, NUS."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This surge in early-stage investment activity was partly boosted by deals done by a number of new accelerators and incubators, such as Antler, SKALA and Accelerating Asia.\"While we continue to see 'mega deals', tech investment in South-east Asia appears to be more diversified this year,\" Cento Ventures said.Geographically, there seemed to be greater diversification in capital deployed, particularly towards Vietnam, although Indonesia and Singapore continued to capture the majority of the activity.Investments into Vietnam made up 17 per cent of the region's total inflows in the first half, a jump from the 5 per cent that the country accounted for in 2018. This comes as the country produces more late-stage companies such as Tiki, VNPay and Vntrip.Meanwhile, Indonesia lost a large share of capital invested due to the absence of mega deals. It captured 48 per cent of the total amount invested in H1 2019, down from 77 per cent in the whole of last year.Investment amounts into Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines were consistent with previous years.A wider range of sectors also attracted interest in January to June. Solid growth was observed in investments into fintech, healthcare and logistics start-ups. While fintech has been popular since 2017, the logistics and healthcare sectors have emerged as some of the most funded sectors.Separately, fintech investments in Singapore were found to have nearly quadrupled from a year ago to US$453 million in the first half this year, placing the city-state as the third-largest fintech market by funds in the Asia-Pacific.

We note declining interest for 20-year leasehold land in the government land sales as industrialists hold off capital expenditure and expansion plans.In addition, business park monthly rents increased 0.5% HoH and 2.1% YoY to $4.33 psf in H1 2019 amidst tight supply.Monthly rents for high-spec industrial buildings located outside of science parks and business parks were up 1% HoH and YoY to $2.93 psf. Meanwhile, average gross monthly rents of warehouse-logistics properties slipped 0.8% HoH and YoY to $1.24 psf over the same period.Going forward, new business park properties and high-spec spaces should continue to enjoy favorable rental growth due to their premium quality and limited stock, whilst older factory space may see flat to declining rents. As such, we expect the rental gap of business park / high-specs spaces and the general factory/warehouse space to widen towards the end of 2019, Colliers continued."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

There are 39 clusters in Singapore gazetted for GCBs.The asking price works out to around $975 per square foot (psf), based on the total land area of 9,232 square feet or 857.7 square metres.In comparison, a landed home at 29 Chestnut Crescent was sold for $8.8 million or $1,103 psf during Q3 2018, Colliers said.\"GCBs are seen as the crme de la crme of the Singapore property market and this presents a rare chance to own one of them at a relatively affordable price,\" said Steven Tan, director of capital markets and investment services at Colliers.The current single-storey home can be potentially redeveloped to a luxury property with two-and-a-half storeys, he noted.Subject to the relevant approvals, the buyer may also acquire an adjacent state land that spans 2,836 sq ft, which could help to lower the overall effective land rate below $975 psf, Mr Tan added.The GCB property is a short drive from the Dairy Farm Quarry and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. Other amenities in the vicinity include Hillion mall, Petir Park, and schools including Bukit Panjang Primary School, Assumption English School, CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace, and Fajar Secondary School.The property is also located near the Cashew and Bukit Panjang MRT stations.The GCB auction will be held on Sep 30, the same day Colliers will also launch a conserved shophouse for auction. Both properties will be offered for sale at 2.30pm at Amara Singapore, Level 3, Connection Room.The owner of the two-storey shophouse on 65 Neil Road is asking for at least $8 million, or around $2,800 psf based on the gross floor area of 2,834 sq ft.The shophouse comes with an attic and has a land area of 1,413 sq ft, Collier's said. It also has 99-year leasehold tenure with effect from July 4, 1989.Colliers understands that the shophouse's owner has engaged an architect to review potential additions and alterations work which could add around 602.5 sq ft to the gross floor area. This brings the overall pricing down to below $2,500 psf.Additional buyer's stamp duty and seller's stamp duty (SSD) are not applicable due to the shophouse's commercial use zoning.Currently, the ground floor of the shophouse is leased to an entertainment establishment which has been occupying the space for the past 15 years.The lease for the second floor to another tenant will be expiring at end-2019. Subject to approval from the Urban Redevelopment Authority, the floor may be used for restaurant, clinic, commercial school, gym/fitness centre, night club, karaoke, student hostel, and residential use, potentially co-living concepts.Colliers' Mr Tan said a heightened interest in shophouses has been seen since new cooling measures were introduced in July 2018.\"Those in prime areas are considered a good investment option owing to their superior location, healthy pedestrian traffic, and the vibrant activities in the vicinity.

Speaking at the companys FY2019 corporate result briefing on Aug 27, he states that the pick-up in residential sales is largely due to the number of new projects launched this year rather than an indication of improving market sentiment. My outlook of the property market in Singapore is still quite subdued, and, in particular, we cannot deny that there is a lot of [incoming] supply in the marketplace that will dampen over-optimistic sentiments on the property market, he says. In Singapore, Wing Tais upcoming project on Middle Road will likely feature smaller units. We have the approval to have more than 500 units [in the development], says Cheng. When the site was launched for sale under the 2H2018 Government Land Sales programme, the guidelines indicated that the site could yield about 375 residential units. Most buyers in the market today are generally end-users, rather than a mix of investors and homeowners. We believe that a project targeted at [the homeowner] segment will still have market opportunities, says Cheng, although he added that the overall residential market is still affected by a lot of incoming supply. For FY2019 ending June 20, 2019, the group recorded a total revenue of $322.6 million, representing a 10% decrease from the $360.4 million revenue recorded in the previous year. The company says this is mainly due to lower contributions from development properties. From left: Ng Kim Huat, group chief financial officer; Edmund Cheng, deputy chairman; Cheng Wai Keung, chairman; Tan Hwee Bin, executive director (Picture: EdgeProp Singapore) Development properties brought in revenue of $136.2 million in FY2019, and is largely attributable to additional units sold in Le Nouvel Ardmore, Le Nouvel KLCC, and BM Mahkota in Penang, and the sale of land in KL, says Ng Kim Huat, Wing Tai CFO. On top of looking for investment opportunities in Singapore, Wing Tai will focus on opportunities in Australia and Japan. In April this year, Wing Tai acquired a 134-room business hotel in Tokyo. As the interest rate remains very low, we have to put some of our capital in safer investments. We believe that investment properties [in these countries] provide a safe investment for the near future, says Cheng.

The plot is also trapezoid-shaped, and situated next to a small park and the Bartley Viaduct.Nearby comparable 99-year-leasehold private residential projects include Bartley Ridge (completed in 2016), Botanique at Bartley (2019), and Bartley Residences (2015), all built on previous GLS sites. These developments transacted on the secondary market at an average of $1,350-1,515 per square foot (psf), Ms Song noted. Meanwhile, 0.8 km towards its north-west, freehold The Gazania and The Lilium at How Sun area recently launched at about $2,000-2,100 psf.Said Ms Song: \"We expect the top bid for this Bartley Road/Jalan Bunga Rampai site to come in at $900-950 psf per plot ratio or $95-100 million, with a potential average selling price of $1,550 psf. Taking into consideration the response to suburban sites post-cooling measures and the palatable quantum of the site, we expect it to attract five to eight bidders.\"She added that the site's attractions include its 400m walking distance to Bartley MRT station on the Circle Line, and partial unblocked view overlooking a low-rise landed estate.The development is within one to two km from Maris Stella High School and Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School. \"Investors could also consider the potential rental catchment of the nearby Paya Lebar Industrial Park and Tai Seng Industrial Estate,\" Ms Song said.Tender for the Jalan Bunga Rampai site will close at 12 noon on Jan 9, 2020. According to URA, the tender closing for this site will be batched with a residential site at Irwell Bank Road, which will be launched for sale in October 2019 under the H2 2019 GLS Programme.A confirmed list site is launched according to a schedule, regardless of demand. This is as opposed to a reserve list site which is only triggered for launch if a developer's indicated minimum price in its application is acceptable to the government."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The income ceiling for eligible buyers has also been raised for the first time since 2015. The new Enhanced CPF Housing Grant (EHG) simplifies the existing Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and the Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) of up to $40,000 respectively. The maximum grant under the EHG will be $80,000, with the income ceiling set at $9,000. This is higher than the AHGs cap of $5,000 and the SHGs cap of $8,500. The new grant applies to both new and resale flat purchases. Unlike the SHG, the EHG has no restrictions on flat type and location. This may help to boost demand for older flats as many of them are in mature estates and stabilise the resale market. Previously, the SHG is for non-mature estates, says Lee Sze Teck, Huttons Asias Director of Research. This year, HDB is on track to supply 15,000 units (Picture Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) To be eligible for the EHG, first-time families have to purchase a flat with a remaining lease that covers them and their spouse until at least the age of 95. According to HDB, families who buy flats with leases that do not cover them until the age of 95 will still receive grants. However, this will be on a pro-rated basis. Meanwhile, eligible first-timer singles aged 35 and above who are earning not more than $4,500 a month can receive up to $40,000 under the EHG. Both families and singles who purchase resale flats within 4km to their parents homes can still receive the Proximity Housing Grant on top of the EHG. In addition, the monthly household income ceiling will increase from $12,000 to $14,000. This applies to eligible families purchasing a flat from the HDB, buying a resale flat with the CPF Housing Grant, or getting a HDB housing loan to buy a new or resale flat. The monthly household income ceiling for first-time single buyers will also increase from $6,000 to $7,000. Meanwhile, the monthly household income ceiling for households to purchase an executive condominium (EC) will be raised to $16,000 from $14,000 previously. With these enhancements, more young couples may want to buy BTO flats. To support this additional demand, we will increase our build-to-order (BTO) flat supply, said Minister Lawrence Wong at the HDB Awards 2019 on Sept 10. This year, HDB is on track to supply 15,000 units. Huttons Asias Lee observes that the private residential market is unlikely to be affected by these announcements as units in this segment are not subject to the five-year minimum occupation period (MOP). Additionally, homeowners are not restricted to who they can sell their units to.

Real estate investment trusts listed in Singapore, with a combined market capitalisation of S$100 billion, make up 10 per cent of the stock market and are often recommended as safe, solidly-yielding investments. While the universe of Singapore-listed Reits - or S-Reits - is diverse, spanning all real estate sectors and many geographies, a small handful have emerged to pique investor interest especially. This year alone, three US property trusts listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), bringing with them exposure to the biggest real estate market globally.SGX market strategist Geoff Howie tells The Business Times: \"Singapore has been growing in strength as a listing platform for US property trusts since 2016, and listed three US property trusts over a three-month span in Singapore earlier this year.\"Two property trusts focusing on hotels listed in May. ARA US Hospitality Trust (ARA-H-Trust) has a total of 38 Hyatt Place and Hyatt House hotels in 21 US states and Eagle Hospitality Trust's (EHT's) portfolio has Marriott, Hilton, IHG hotels and even the former cruise liner The Queen Mary as its assets. July saw the listing of Prime US Reit (Prime), which focuses on office properties across nine cities.On the day of their listings, both ARA-H-Trust and Prime had tepid debuts, each closing at their IPO price of US$0.88. EHT fared worse, dropping 6.4 per cent from its IPO price of US$0.78 to close at US$0.73 on its first day.Traders were not surprised, as the listings were close to each other in both portfolio and timing: EHT listed just two weeks after ARA-H-Trust, and both are hospitality-focused. As well, markets were volatile in May after US President Donald Trump first threatened to raise tariffs on China this year, hurting sentiment all around.That said, ARA-H-Trust and EHT have posted their first set of earnings since listing, with distribution per unit (DPU) for both beating IPO forecasts. ARA-H-Trust posted a DPU of 1.36 US cents, 3.8 per cent higher than expected, while EHT recorded a DPU of 0.65 US cent, 1.2 per cent more than predicted.While these new listings may have come thick and fast, pure-play US Reits first set foot here in 2016 with Manulife US Reit's (MUST) listing. Just over a year later, fellow office play Keppel KBS US Reit (KORE) followed. (It now trades as Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit)On Friday, MUST gained 0.5 US cent or 0.6 per cent to end at US$0.91 while KORE was unchanged at US$0.75. Among the new boys, ARA-H-Trust added one US cent or 1.2 per cent to US$0.865. EHT was flat closing at US$0.665; and so did Prime, at US$0.895.Investors might see a fourth such listing in Singapore by year's end.Last month, BT reported that a US grocery-anchored retail cum self-storage Reit with properties mostly listed on the East Coast and sponsored UOB Global and an American property firm may be on the cards.Above-average yieldsWith average dividend yield of 6.2 per cent, S-Reits as a group are one of the highest yielding in the region and globally. This compares with the Asia-Pacific median of 5.1 per cent and the global median of 4.8 per cent. Meanwhile, 10 year US Treasuries are currently yielding 1.8 per cent.Those on the hunt for yield will find the pure-play US Reits and trusts attractive, says UOB Kay Hian director of research Jonathan Koh. Of the five US pure plays, four have distribution yields of 7 per cent, he notes. (MUST has a yield of 6.7 per cent).Those calling a buy on US Reits believe that macroeconomic conditions support the growth of the US real estate sector. As it stands, the American economy continues to experience stable growth, expanding 2.1 per cent in the second quarter of 2019 with unemployment levels hovering at multi-year lows of 3.7 per cent. Disposable income levels are also expected to remain strong.While concerns remain that the US-China trade scuffle will be a long-term pain, the US Federal Reserve has committed to keeping its economy's longest bull run going, and odds are in favour of at least one more interest rate cut, which lowers borrowing costs, by year-end.And in this current climate, Phillip Securities' research head Paul Chew views US Reits listed on the SGX as the most attractive in the S-Reit sector.\"Dividend yields are higher and the US economy is more vibrant and outlook for currency is better. Moreover, the Singapore dollar looks vulnerable in the near term with the likely easing of monetary policy by Monetary Authority of Singapore next month plus the overhang on all Asian currencies from a weaker yuan,\" Mr Chew says.His sentiment is echoed by RHB Research Institute analyst Vijay Natarajan, who has MUST as his top Reit pick. He feels that the short term strength of greenback may benefit local investors.But he adds: \"This to me shouldn't be the key reason for investing in US Reits, but to provide some diversification benefits both in terms of geography and currencies.\" RHB has a \"Buy\" call on MUST with a target price of US$0.98, in an Aug 15 report.Similarly, a DBS report dated Aug 22 says: \"We maintain our BUY call on Manulife US Real Estate Investment Trust (MUST) with a revised target price of US$1.10. With tax concerns largely allayed in our view, we believe that investors will look towards MUST's consistent delivery of a 4.5 per cent CAGR in FY19-21F DPU (Distribution Per Unit) to drive higher valuations for the stock.\"For sure, there are risk factors too. While the US property market's macro fundamentals appear strong, Maybank Kim Eng analyst Chua Su Tye finds that demand has matched the very high supply and there are pockets of higher vacancy rates. \"So, there are concerns that the market has reached its peak, and hence limited upside to valuations from here.\"And as Alan Lok, a former equity analyst who is currently working on a doctorate on the Reit market points out: \"Unlike Singapore, which has a limited capacity to build further properties that in turn ensures generally high occupation rates, the US market is very competitive and land is in vast quantity, resulting in lower occupancies, which in turn affects dividends.\"Motley Fool Singapore also points out that for EHT, two hotels - The Queen Mary Long Beach and Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites Waterpark - contribute around 31 per cent of the trust's fixed rental income. \"As such, Eagle Hospitality Trust, despite its relatively large portfolio of 18 properties, is still highly dependent on just two properties within its portfolio,\" says the May report.Sector-specific advantages of US property playsBut there are sector-specific advantages that US Reits and trusts listed here have reaped.In the Singapore market for office space, leases are typically signed for three years at a time with flat rental charges during the tenure. In comparison, leases in the US are often signed for periods between 5-10 years, with annual rental escalations of 2-3 per cent per annum and mid-term escalations of 1-2 per cent annum.Longer leases translate to a larger weighted average lease to expiry (WALE), a figure that points to a Reit's income stability. The figure for Prime is 5.5 years and for MUST is 6.2 years , which Maybank Kim Eng's Mr Chua explains is longer than the typical 3-4 years for offices here but in line with US averages.While KORE's portfolio has a lower WALE of 4.2 years, a Q2 US office rental report by real estate services firm JLL showed leasing activity in the US remains robust. In addition, the technology sector, which KORE has a focus in, took up the most leasing space in the first half of the year. This suggests ample opportunity for the Reit to capitalise on growing demand.Referring to the three US office Reits, Mr Chua says: \"They have sensibly invested in properties with very long leases - which help mitigate any near term down-cycles, and also funded these purchases through locked-in long term debt. This, together with US properties being freehold, supports visibility for dividends.\"The office Reits also have occupancy rates well above national and market average, Mr Natarajan says. Meanwhile, rental rates are mostly below the average, which gives the Reits room to make positive rental reversions while remaining a viable option during an economic downturn when firms want to lower rental expenses. Of MUST's eight properties, just one has rental rates above the market average.In the US hospitality sector, meanwhile, revenue per available room (RevPAR) has consistently grown as demand for rooms has continued to outpace supply.Future supply growth is expected to be constrained by rising construction costs, tight labour supply and costs of raw materials. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for RevPAR between 2013 and 2018 for select-service hotels (which provide limited services and amenities) like those in ARA-H-Trust's portfolio, stood at 4.6 per cent compared with the 3.4 per cent for full-service hotels.While RevPAR is expected to ease between 2019 and 2022, the growth of select-service hotels like Hyatt House and Hyatt Place are expected to grow at 2 per cent per year, outpacing the 1.3 per cent estimated for full service hotels.Lee Jin Yong, CEO of the manager of ARA-H-Trust, recognises that the hospitality sector will not avoid the impact of an economic downturn like other real estate classes, but points out: \"Select-service hotels are the most resilient category within the hospitality industry. In a recession, full-service hotels (especially luxury/leisure) are usually the most impacted since such spending are usually discretionary in nature.\"At its first earnings release, ARA-H-Trust's portfolio achieved a RevPAR index score of 106.8 per cent, outperforming peers in terms of revenue contribution. Its Hyatt House and Hyatt Place properties outperformed RevPAR of comparable hotels by 14.4 and 3.9 per cent, respectively.Another factor that might attract investors are the better dividend returns that Singapore-listed US Reits and property trusts distribute to unitholders compared to their US-listed equivalents.US-listed Reits usually retain 50 per cent of their cash for capital expenditure at the funds from operations level, to define the cash flow from their operations.They then distribute almost all of the remaining 50 per cent of their net income to investors, of which 30 per cent is withholding tax by US tax authorities for non-US citizens. In addition, there are higher limits for development activities for US-listed Reits which can also suppress their yields.In contrast, there is no tax in Singapore on income that is foreign-sourced. Investors in US Reits and property trusts here benefit from exposure in the US without being subject to the 30 per cent withholding tax, as long as they have their W8 and W9 US tax forms validated. ARA-H-Trust does not require investors to fill up those forms as it makes tax filings on behalf of unitholders.While there were worries over new tax regulations that kicked in back in January 2018, MUST and KORE acted quickly to adjust their tax structures minimising the impact on distributable income for unitholders.Education key for US Reit managersAs much as investors here have a strong understanding of investing in property-related entities, pure-play US Reits and property trusts are still a fairly new commodity. This could affect trading liquidity due to a lack of understanding of the US economy and its property market.With the global economy facing a slowdown, ARA-H-Trust's Mr Lee recalls: \"The health of the US economy and the impact of the trade war on our business are two concerns that we frequently hear.\"MUST's CEO Jill Smith says: \"In the past three years, we have met many investors who, whilst keen to invest, have expressed unfamiliarity with the US real estate market.\"As our properties are not in gateway cities such as New York or San Francisco, we had to work harder to increase investors' understanding and appreciation of the US commercial real estate market.\"The sentiment is shared by David Snyder, CEO of the manager of KORE, who feels the biggest challenge tends to be lack of familiarity with itsmarkets.Yet those markets, he contends, perform better than the average in the US and in the gateway cities. Gross domestic product in cities where KORE's properties are located is forecast to grow 3 per cent annually compared to the US and gateway city average of 2.1 per cent.In September 2018, at the height of US-China trade tensions, MUST invited its sponsor Canadian insurer Manulife's US-based global chief economist to share perspectives on the trade war and rate hikes, a talk which Ms Smith tells BT was well received.For MUST, KORE, and ARA-H-Trust, investor education includes talks on economic, employment and population growth in the US market, as well as the annual Reit Symposium organised by ShareInvestor and the Reit Association of Singapore, and educational seminars by SGX.MUST has also engaged financial bloggers to share the Reit's strategy and even produce videos for its properties, Ms Smith explains.July-listed Prime intends to follow the path of those before it with a pipeline of analyst briefings, investor outreach initiatives with brokerage houses and SGX as well as non-deal roadshow opportunities.RHB's Mr Natarajan says prospects for the US-only portfolios are bright. \"With more US Reits listing in Singapore, we believe investors will slowly gain a better understanding of US market dynamics which should help in sector re-rating. The US market's large size and deep pool of assets also offers good future growth potential for the sector,\" he notes.Maybank Kim Eng's Mr Chua adds: \"We are positive on growth for the market - especially in new and niche asset classes - multi-family properties and data centres. The US commercial market is also very deep and liquid and we think offers growth opportunities for the Reit managers.\"What draws US Reits to SingaporeTHE attraction for Jill Smith, chief executive officer of Manulife US REIT, was quite clear in 2016. Canada-based Manulife decided on Singapore as the city-state was the \"only Reit market in Asia that has international Reits\".\"The market here was evolving quite rapidly with local Reits expanding out of Singapore to Australia, China and Europe,\" Ms Smith says in a report recently completed by KPMG and the Reit Association of Singapore.A Prime spokesperson agrees: \"The accessibility to broad capital raising network is another one of those considerations for listing in Singapore.\"Other reasons cited include a favourable tax regime for Reits, a clear and transparent regulatory framework with a strong focus on corporate governance as well as a stable government.\"Fast forward to 2019, the attractiveness of SGX for US Reit listings has not diminished,\" Ms Smith tells BT.Investors here are also well acquainted with Reits as investment instruments, as well as their structure and exposure to foreign assets.Around 80 per cent of S-Reits own properties overseas, and the trend suggests that more locally focused Reit managers are looking abroad to make acquisitions.\"As the offerings become more diverse, both geographically and sectoral, local investors have also become more sophisticated in their understanding of and exposure to different Reit products,\" Lee Jin Yong, CEO of the manager of ARA-H-Trust says.David Snyder, the CEO of the manager of KORE notes: \"We have been seeing increasing interest coming out from Asia in US real estate, and a listing in Singapore was a great opportunity for KORE to access the Asian market given its growing and diverse investor base, both retail and institutional.\"The rapid growth of Singapore's private wealth management sector has also added significantly to the investor mix, he adds.Compared to listing in the US, Maybank Kim Eng analyst Chua Su Tye feels US asset managers with smaller portfolios of assets between US$0.8 billion and US$1.3 billion might be able to get better valuations here than in the US.As Alan Lok, a former equity analyst who is currently working on a doctorate on the Reit market, notes: \"Institutional investors and fund managers in the Singapore market are always keen on income yielding instruments like Reits.\"Having covered the asset class for more than a decade, he adds that fund managers based here might have a preference for assets listed in the region, regardless of where the portfolios lie."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The semiconductor industry forms about 7 per cent of Singapore's economy.In spite of slower growth now, the sector had enjoyed strong expansion in the preceding few years, with fresh demand driven by new applications in the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and mobility services, said Mr Heng.An area to note is autonomous vehicles, with the global semiconductor market - between electric vehicles and autonomous ones - expected to expand from US$37.4 billion (S$51.5 billion) in 2017 to more than US$58.5 billion in 2023, he said.STMicroelectronics' new facility will more than double its capacity to produce eight-inch wafers in Singapore, and aims to augment its strength in the areas of car electrification and digitalisation, and other high-growth industrial processes.The launch comes just a month after US-based global semiconductor company Micron unveiled its \"multibillion-dollar\" wafer fab expansion plan in Singapore, growing its clean room space for 3D NAND flash memory products largely made in the Republic.Mr Heng noted that apart from making next-generation chips and microcontrollers in the new facility, which was officially opened on Tuesday, companies such as STMicroelectronics are investing in their employees, building the local talent pool.The new facility has added more than 400 new jobs to the company's current workforce. STMicroelectronics now has close to 5,000 workers here. More than 40 per cent of its front-end manufacturing roles here are that of operators, followed by engineers and technicians.Noting that 2019 marks the 50th year of STMicroelectronics' operations in Singapore, Mr Heng said that the partnership between the company and Singapore has \"endured through economic crises and challenges\", with both sides pulling through stronger each time.\"During challenging economic conditions, the Singapore Government worked closely with companies like STMicroelectronics to retrain and upskill existing workers,\" he said. \"As a result, our workforce could emerge stronger and more capable from these difficult times.\"At the event, STMicroelectronics chief executive Jean-Marc Chery said there is an ever-increasing demand for complex electronics systems, which are needed for products that help to solve challenges such as population increases and rising complexities in mobility, among others.\"As a technology-believer and innovation-driven company, STMicroelectronics continues to invest in manufacturing as a key business enabler,\" he said. The company, he said, wants to be a leader in automotives, among other areas.He added that Singapore is a \"strategic location\" for the company's investment, with pro-business policies as well as a highly educated and skilled workforce.The company's latest expansion sits on a wafer fabrication facility in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 12, which it earlier bought from Micron for US$30 million."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It excludes direct investments by government-related entities. More than 800 respondents participated in the latest survey.Singapore continued to serve as the global-Asia gateway for asset managers and investors to tap the region's growth opportunities, with three-quarters of AUM sourced from outside the Republic in 2018.Singapore's AUM growth was uneven across the traditional and alternative asset management sectors, the survey found.Inflows were strong in traditional sector strategies managed or advised out of Singapore, but these were more than offset by weaker valuations across major asset markets in tandem with global trends. As a result, traditional AUM was sluggish and shrank 7 per cent in 2018.However, the alternatives sector continued to register robust growth, expanding by 15 per cent to S$646 billion last year. In particular, PE, VC and real estate saw strong inflows and continued valuation gains as investors increased their exposures to private assets, to enhance returns and diversify portfolios.\"Singapore, as a leading private markets hub, is an attraction location for investment managers and an increasing number of global public investors, including sovereign wealth funds and pension funds,\" MAS said in its survey report.In the medium term, prospects for the city-state's asset management industry remain favourable.For one, AUM in Asia-Pacific is expected to almost double from 2017 to about US$30 trillion in 2025, according to PwC's estimates, and Singapore is well placed to serve this regional trend, the central bank noted.Fresh demand from global investors for growing areas such as private markets, infrastructure and green investments will also fuel the growth and diversity of the Singapore ecosystem.MAS also said on Wednesday that the Variable Capital Company (VCC) framework is expected to be operational by the end of 2019. VCCs are a flexible corporate structure for investment funds, meant to encourage managers to co-locate fund domiciliation in Singapore. Before the framework becomes operational, MAS will collaborate with interested fund managers on a pilot programme to identify areas of improvement within the process of incorporating or re-domiciling funds as VCCs."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

In July, she was appointed the Singapore Chair for the Urban Land Institute (ULI). The global, independent non-profit has the oldest and largest network of cross-disciplinary real estate and land use experts in the world. The mission of ULI is to provide leadership for the responsible use of land and to create thriving and sustainable communities worldwide. So that really resonates with me, Ong says. Ong: Ultimately, real estate is about people and we are in an amazing industry where we can make a difference, one step at a time (Credit: Albert Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) With a real estate career spanning more than 25 years, she has advised on the master planning of land parcels in Medini, Iskandar Malaysia (930ha); Vientiane, Laos (44ha) and Mauritius Airport City (17ha). At home, she was involved in the Gardens by the Bay project (101ha). Recalling her experience, Ong says in the early 2000s when Gardens by the Bay was still just an idea, there were not many places in the Central Area where Singaporeans could be close to nature besides the Singapore Botanic Gardens. We want our children to not just go to malls, but also to have places that let them run about and be close to nature, she says. In land-scarce Singapore, Ong notes, it can be difficult to justify allocating land use to a park versus selling it off in the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. She says: At the end of the day, sustainability is also about economic sustainability. You cant just build a park that is not economically sustainable. This means you have to come up with taxpayers money. To ensure economic sustainability, the planning committee decided to price admission to Gardens by the Bay at $12 for Singaporeans or roughly around the same price as a movie ticket, she says. This ensures that the attraction remains accessible to the public. Focus on wellness Central to her ethos, Ong believes that when thinking about real estate, one should first consider the people they are catering for. This belief is manifested in Edmund Ties office at UIC Building on Shenton Way. The firm was previously located at Shaw Tower for more than 20 years. In the 1970s, [Shaw Tower] was an amazing building, but now its like a grand old dame, she says. Over time, Ong noticed that the aircon ducts required more frequent cleaning and many of the firms staff were falling ill. She also felt guilty that only her office had windows with views of the outside, and made it a point to leave her door open and shades raised so her staff can enjoy the views too. In 2017, the firm shifted to its current premises. There, everyone in the open-plan office can benefit from the unobstructed sea view. Each employee has a 1.5m-long desk; for those who prefer standing while they work, adjustable desks are also an option. The floor-to-ceiling windows allow all Edmund Tie employees to enjoy an unobstructed sea view (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/ EdgeProp Singapore) The company has also done away with personal wastepaper baskets, opting instead for common recycling bins and paper shredders in designated areas around the office. The idea is to get employees out of their seats to walk to the bins, which keeps them active and fosters interaction among staff, says Ong. The office is also wired for hot-desking so staff can work from anywhere. These design elements have paid off. Ong recalls that when the company was at Shaw Tower, during exit interviews, the physical work environment was always cited as a reason for leaving. [At the new office], my staff feel happier so our retention rate is a lot higher, she says. The Edmund Tie office has adjustable desks for those who prefer standing while they work (Credit: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) Apart from Edmund Tie, Ong highlights, developers are also looking at how they can promote wellness within their spaces. At the same time, buyers are also becoming more discerning. As a result, developers are now fitting out commercial and residential projects outside the Central Area with features that one would typically find only in the prime areas. Thats become the new normal, she says. Developers actually think about how the occupiers use that space. In particular, this is a common theme in this years project submissions for EdgeProp Singapore Excellence Awards, Ong notes. Into its third year, the Awards benchmarks outstanding quality in property development. This is the second year that Ong is serving as a judge on the panel. Learning through mistakes Whether it is sustainable land use or designing for wellness, Ong observes that the common denominator is putting people first: When it comes to real estate, not everything can be directly translated into dollars and cents. If you do good, youre actually brand-building. People trust your brand, that you are client-focused and that you are aligned with them, she explains. In addition to providing a better work environment, Ong hopes to strengthen Edmund Tie by nurturing the companys next generation of leaders. To do this, she fosters a safe environment for staff to innovate by giving them opportunities to try new ideas and accepting that people make mistakes. If you dont make mistakes, youll never have the courage to innovate. Of course, this is a calculated risk, she says. Sometimes its very painful when you know that it is not quite the right thing to do, but you have to let people experiment and come to their own conclusions. To her, learning is not restricted to a top-down approach. Instead, Ong is always happy to learn from her staff. Its not just the older people mentoring their juniors, but it is also the juniors and young people mentoring me, she observes. Giving back Ong reveals that she owes much of her career success to mentors who took a chance on her. She vividly remembers her first job as a valuer, when she was tasked to assess the value of a cold store in Pasir Panjang. She was stumped. As part of her studies, she had learned that there are three methods of valuation comparable, income and cost. However, she could not apply any of these methods as there was not enough information and data. She then turned to her mentor and industry expert, MH Goh of MH Goh, Tan & Partners (now Colliers International), who gave her the guidance she needed to complete the valuation. Ong also remembers Douglas Hiorns, the late general manager of Bukit Sembawang, who granted her an interview when she was researching her dissertation for graduate school. She had written letters to developers requesting interviews with them but only Hiorns responded. I was a nobodyand he granted me the interview, she says. I will never forget his kindness to me. Now, Ong wants to pay it forward. Theres always an opportunity to give back, and you must not be afraid to share with people, she says. Real estate is not about bricks and mortar. Ultimately, real estate is about people and we are in an amazing industry where we can make a difference, one step at a time.

While RP had previously undergone several enhancements, this is its first major facelift since the building was completed in 1996. RP comprises a 66-storey Grade-A office building with retail podium and a 23-storey annex block. It has a total gross floor area of approximately 1.1 million sq ft and total net lettable area of 780,000 sq ft. The RP revamp is the second AEI that CDL has undertaken as part of its growth, enhancement, transformation (G-E-T) strategy. Last year, CDL completed a $30 million AEI for Le Grove Serviced Residences, reconfiguring the original 97-unit property into 173 serviced apartments for lease. Republic Plazas AEI includes a major makeover of its main lobby, arrival frontage, individual lift lobbies as well as lift modernisation (Photos: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore) The revamp of RP reflects our focus on rejuvenating our existing assets to unlock value and strengthen our recurring income stream, says Sherman Kwek, group CEO of CDL. Post AEI, we have seen positive rental reversions at RP and achieved strong committed occupancy of over 90%, with the retail space fully leased. More retail and F&B options RPs AEI includes a major makeover of its main lobby, arrival frontage, individual lift lobbies, as well as lift modernisation. In addition, the Grade-A office buildings retail podium was expanded by another 3,400 sq ft of lettable space. This was done by partially converting its car-park area. CDL also reworked RPs public area layouts to improve pedestrian traffic, and technical specifications were upgraded to cater for more F&B offerings. Following the revamp, RP now has 24,100 sq ft of retail space across three levels where close to 40 F&B and retail outlets are located. Over 80% of the retail tenants are new to RP, while returning tenants include TWG Tea, Ptisserie Glac, The Herbal Bar and Bose. CDL has reworked RPs public area layouts to improve pedestrian traffic Dining options include familiar names like Din Tai Fung, Starbucks, Caf Amazon, MOS Burger, Cedele and Dimbulah. Meanwhile, there are several new-to-market concepts like Heybo, Shin Donburi, BIGDADDY and SUKHUMVIT 100. The new retail enclave also has customisable grab-and-go concepts like SIMPLEburger Inc, MOJO and Wok Hey. CityNexus smart building app Apart from boosting its retail offerings, CDL has created CityNexus, a smart building app that enhances the user experience of tenants. With the app, tenants can access valueadded services such as building access, meeting room booking, air-con extension requests and building feedback submissions. The app also allows tenants to provide their guests with direct turnstile entry and book dedicated VIP parking lots. CityNexus includes an order-pay-collect function that enables office tenants to preorder their meals from RPs F&B outlets and notifies them when the pick-up is ready. CDL has also collaborated with United Overseas Bank to provide F&B tenants with financial and digital solutions that complement the preorder function. This helps tenants to streamline their transaction workflow, improve operational efficiency and gain real-time insights into their finances. RPs several new-to-market concepts like Shin Donburi Kwek reveals plans to add more services on the CityNexus platform. Currently available exclusively to RP, the app will potentially be rolled out across other CDL office buildings in Singapore and overseas, he says. Beyond commercial space In conjunction with the launch of the revamped RP, a Founders Gallery was unveiled to honour the late Kwek Hong Png, founder of the Hong Leong Group, CDLs parent company. Located at the main entrance of RP, the gallery encapsulates his achievements and philanthropic contributions and pays tribute to one of Singapores pioneer business leaders. Continuing his legacy of entrepreneurship, RP is providing a platform to support aspiring social innovators. This also complements CDLs commitment to sustainability. A unit at RPs basement has been converted into an incubator and co-working space for start-ups and social enterprises, called Incubator4SDGs. This initiative is in partnership with the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise, the United Nations Development Programme and Social Collider. Sherman Kwek, group CEO of CDL, unveils the Founders Gallery at RP Elsewhere, RP has Singapores largest ultrahigh-definition (UHD) LED wall in an office building. At 1,800 sq ft, the digital wall comprises 622 UHD LED panels and serves as a digital canvas for CDL to transform RPs lobby into a gallery with varying sensory experiences throughout the day.

Other warehouse occupiers are the manufacturing sector (30 per cent); distributors (10 per cent); food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals (6 per cent); oil, marine and energy (5 per cent); and IT and technology (5 per cent).Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore at Colliers International, said: \"Singapore is a top-class logistics hub with the world's busiest transshipment port, second busiest port in terms of total cargo tonnage handled, and the 12th busiest airport by cargo traffic as at 2018.\"As such, Singapore has been the location of choice for e-commerce players to establish their footprint when entering the region. The emergence of e-commerce in recent years has had a positive spillover to the 3PL and logistics sector in Singapore.\"A newly released e-Conomy 2019 report by Temasek, Google and Bain & Company estimates South-east Asia's Internet economy to be worth US$100 billion by end-2019, with e-commerce taking the lion's share at US$38 billion. That represents an increase of almost six times from US$5.5 billion in 2015.Colliers said regional trade and growth in e-commerce should channel to stronger warehouse demand in the long term and benefit the city-state given its logistics hub status.However, the small market size as well as greater efficiencies in inventory forecasting and stock management could potentially moderate the need for drastic warehouse expansion, said Colliers.The JTC rental index showed that warehouse rent has been on a downward trend for more than five years, with Q2 2019 rental index declining by 19.4 per cent from its peak in Q4 2013.Colliers said this was possibly due to the influx of new supply averaging 6.3 million sq ft per year during the 2014-2018 period, bringing total warehouse stock to 117 million sq ft as at Q2 2019.It does not expect a sustained oversupply of warehouse stock as Singapore's logistics hub status should benefit from both domestic and regional growth in e-commerce.Colliers expects overall warehouse supply to ease, with annual expansion averaging 1.5 per cent of warehouse total stock over 2019-2023 versus 7.6 per cent for the previous four years over 2014-2018.With new supply tapering off, it forecasts the overall vacancy rate to stabilise at 10.8 per cent in 2020.There is about 117 million sq ft of total warehouse space in Singapore, and more than 80 per cent are located in the east and west regions.Colliers also ranked micro-markets in these regions in the report, with Changi placing first followed by Tuas and Boon Lay/Jurong West.Colliers' research team evaluated the logistics micro-markets against four criteria: presence of an existing logistics cluster and supporting infrastructure; availability of quality warehouse stock with consideration of both existing and future supply, as well as vacancy rate; accessibility to airport or sea ports; and rent premium compared to islandwide average.Changi tops the list due to its proximity to Changi Airport, but it has limited warehouse space with unit sizes generally smaller than those in the west. Due to strong demand, this micro-market has the highest occupancy rate among major logistics locations in Singapore, said Colliers.Tuas and Boon Lay/Jurong West both have a double-digit vacancy rate. However, Tuas will be home to the world's largest container terminal when a new mega port becomes fully operational beyond 2040, while Boon Lay/Jurong West will have the upcoming Jurong Innovation District and the future Jurong Regional Line."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The mature industrial area is ahead of other industrial zones in Tuas and the cluster around Boon Lay/Jurong West, according to a report by Colliers International. In Changi, available stock in the industrial area is limited and warehouse unit sizes are typically smaller than those in the West region. Total warehouse space in Changi amounts to about 3.7 million sq ft, compared to other areas such as the cluster at Jurong East/Clementi which has a total warehouse stock of 30 million sq ft. However, there is strong demand for industrial space in Changi from light industries, logistics and third-party logistics operators requiring air transportation. The latter two business segments are the top industrial space occupiers, accounting for about 44% of occupied warehouse space in Singapore. As a result, the vacancy rate in Changi is the lowest among the major logistics locations in Singapore at close to 2.7%, compared to the cluster at Tampines/Paya Lebar at 15.2% or Tuas at 10.5%. Singapore has been the location of choice for e-commerce players to establish their footprint when entering the region. The emergence of e-commerce in recent years has had a positive spillover to the 3PL and logistics sector in Singapore, says Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore at Colliers International. Other warehouse occupiers in Singapore include the manufacturing sector which takes up 30% of warehouse space; distributors (10%); food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals (6%); oil, marine and energy companies (5%); and IT and technology (5%). According to the report, regional trade and the growth in e-commerce is likely to translate into stronger warehouse demand in the long term, but greater efficiencies in inventory forecasting and stock management may moderate the need for drastic warehouse expansion. Overall warehouse rents in Singapore have been sliding for more than five years, and the latest JTC rental index showed that in 2Q2019 the index had declined by 19.4% from its peak in 4Q2013. The warehouse rental index fell 0.2% q-o-q in 2Q2019, and declined by 0.2% y-o-y. Logistics rents are expected to remain weak in the near term, and with a more benign warehouse supply pipeline, occupancies and rents could improve from 2022 onwards, says Song. It is timely for tenants to review their lease and space requirements, and explore options. They can consider locating further away from the city centre to enjoy rental savings or opt for customised and build-to-suit warehouse facilities which would offer greater rental certainty, says Dominic Peters, senior director of industrial services at Colliers.

While it is considered cleaner than coal and oil, natural gas is still a fossil fuel nonetheless.Human activity such as the combustion of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat on the planet like a blanket.The excess heat melts ice sheets and throws the climate system out of whack, causing weather patterns to change and extreme weather events to increase in frequency and intensity.On how the Government is urging existing industries to cut their emissions, Dr Koh pointed to its focus on energy efficiency. \"For existing industries, we are encouraging companies to adopt energy-efficient technologies,\" he said.This would essentially mean that firms can produce the same amount or increase their output, with less resources and fossil fuels needed as input.He added that the Government had this year implemented an enhanced set of industry energy-efficiency schemes.From January this year, funding support for the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, under the Economic Development Board's Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy and the National Environment Agency's (NEA) Energy Efficiency Fund, has been increased from the previous cap of 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the qualifying costs.He also said that from 2021, companies regulated under the Energy Conservation Act must establish energy management systems and regularly assess energy-efficiency opportunities.The NEA is also planning to launch a new grant to help companies digitalise their energy management systems, he said.Under the climate targets that Singapore made under the Paris Agreement, Singapore pledged to become greener economically and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted to achieve each dollar of gross domestic product by 36 per cent from 2005 levels, come 2030. It also pledged to stop any further increases to its greenhouse gas emissions by the same timeline.Ms Ong had asked how Singapore's emissions would grow with an expansion of refinery facilities here.Dr Koh said that when companies expand or new ones invest in Singapore, the Government works with them to ensure a high standard of efficiency.He cited the Singapore Refining Company upgrading its Jurong Island premises, which led to greater energy efficiency and reduced sulphur oxide emissions.ExxonMobil, too, had recently expanded its manufacturing complex in Singapore, which is one of the most efficient refineries globally, he said.He said the Government was urging other sectors, not just the refineries and petrochemicals sector, to be energy efficient.Facebook's first data centre in Singapore, for example, will be energy efficient and also have features to minimise its use of land and water, he said.He added: \"Beyond industries, all of us have a responsibility to mitigate climate change. Saving electricity, using public transport and reducing waste are good ways to cut carbon emissions. As a country, we will do our part to help address global climate challenges.\"Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

It is critical for Soilbuild to stay nimble and on course with our multi-sectoral strategies to ensure that we will be able to recalibrate ourselves quickly in response to any market changes, and to shorten our investment to sales cycle,\" says Mr Lim.His father is Soilbuild Group's executive chairman Lim Chap Huat, one of the three entrepreneurs who started the company back in 1976. Then a small contractor, Soilbuild grew quickly on the back of Singapore's rapid industrialisation, building workshops and warehouses.Since then, it has moved into property development and investment and expanded its portfolio. Properties that Soilbuild constructs, develops and manages today range from flatted factories and hi-tech business spaces that have won awards for green design, to public housing projects and luxury condominiums.2012 was when Soilbuild first stepped out of Singapore, into Myanmar. The next year, 2013, two of its core arms of business were listed on the Singapore Exchange - Soilbuild Construction Group and Soilbuild Business Space Reit. This, after the elder Mr Lim decided to privatise Soilbuild Group Holdings in 2010, five years after first listing it in 2005.Diversifying wiselyDiversification of sectors and geographies is a strategy Soilbuild continues to fine-tune today, says Lim Han Qin. For the property development and investment division, for instance, a \"multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary strategy\" is what the group is building on.\"We constantly review our capital allocation strategies on the various property segments and geographical spread. The last 10 years or so saw us putting a heavier allocation on the industrial front, as a result of those reviews,\" says Mr Lim. This year alone, Soilbuild has completed two business developments at Kallang Way, with five other business space projects still under development.OCBC Bank's managing director, head of Real Estate and Construction, Global Enterprise Banking, Jazmine Chua, says that this is how the company has managed \"to be a trailblazer in the industry\".\"Soilbuild is pioneering in many ways. They went into industrial buildings before others and sustainability has been at the heart of their agenda for many years, even before it became widely talked about,\" she says.Rising competition and costs first pushed Soilbuild to head overseas in 2012. By then, winning project bids meant facing down competition from a growing pool of local contractors-turned-developers and foreign entrants. Meanwhile, costs - from manpower to construction materials to rent - continued to climb.Choosing Myanmar as a first stop came with its own challenges - interpreting local laws and regulations, the higher costs of project financing due to the risks, and a shortage of skilled construction manpower. But it has been worth it. Seven years on, Soilbuild's construction group now has three wholly-owned subsidiaries in Myanmar, providing a range of construction services to both local and foreign clients.And while the decline in Singapore's construction market persists - seen in the second straight full-year net loss of S$3.3 million that Soilbuild Construction reported in FY2018 - revenue contributions from its Myanmar operations are rising. In FY2018, its Myanmar division raked in S$50.8 million in revenue, an 85.1 per cent jump from the year before, contributing close to a quarter of Soilbuild Construction's total revenue of S$208.6 million.In 2017, Soilbuild entered Vietnam. The maiden project there, a 1,500-unit residential development with a retail podium linked to an upcoming metro station, reflects the reasons Soilbuild chose to enter the market.\"Both Vietnam and Myanmar share similar demographics in terms of its large population, high literacy rates and a growing middle-income group. reflect their long-term growth potential, although macro socio-political dynamics may continue to have an impact [in the short term],\" says Mr Lim.And the group is on the lookout for other South-east Asian opportunities. \"We like the growth potential and proximity of the South-east Asian countries, and are looking to broaden our regional push to other emerging or growing economies in this region,\" says Mr Lim.That, by no means, limits its overseas ventures to this neighbourhood. Soilbuild Reit has expanded its investment mandate to cover opportunities in Australia, acquiring its first properties there - an office space in Canberra City and a poultry processing plant - in 2018.\"Venturing beyond Singapore helps increase the Reit's pool of investment targets, provide access to assets with longer land tenures and allow diversification of the tenant base, thereby strengthening our portfolio for long-term growth,\" says Mr Lim.And earlier this year, Soilbuild took on its first project in the United Kingdom - a forward funding investment into a purpose-built student accommodation project in Devon Street, Liverpool.The eventual hope is to replicate what Soilbuild has achieved in Singapore in the various markets it has set foot in. But that is not a goal to rush towards, says Mr Lim. \"We believe that property is a 'local' business and we need to deepen our understanding of the market and the various stakeholders within, before we can deepen our roots and widen the reach of our branches.\"Prioritising innovationBack home in Singapore, various challenges highlight the wisdom of prioritising innovation.On top of slowing demand, manpower constraints and productivity growth remain perennial concerns for the construction sector. Soilbuild's construction arm is addressing this by investing in new construction methods, precast and prefabrication technologies and materials research, while incorporating digitisation and robotics into its operations.The company scored the third \"integrated construction and prefabrication hub\" (ICPH) public tender that the Building and Construction Authority awarded back in 2016, and has invested in highly automated manufacturing processes. \"This will further reduce our reliance on foreign workers and improve overall construction productivity,\" says Mr Lim. In 2016, Soilbuild had about 650 foreign site workers. Today, that number is 330.\"The group has always been a believer of innovation,\" says Mr Lim. \"With technologies disrupting various industries, we believe in focusing and seeding the potential that these could bring, instead of lamenting the impact and changes that are inevitable.\"It is in that light that Soilbuild is working with B2B platforms to support real estate and construction players that have difficulty securing funding through traditional sources. Last year, it joined a US$5 million early-stage funding round for Helicap, a Singapore-based platform offering funding to alternative lenders such as peer-to-peer platforms.As a group that has \"long adopted sustainability as its operational agenda\" with award-winning green projects such as Solaris@one-north, Soilbuild also recently adopted green financing - lending that is conditional on environmental criteria.Last month, it secured its first green loan of S$248 million - co-issued by HSBC and OCBC - to build its third Green Mark Platinum business space. Mr Lim sees this as an example of how the group seeks to \"better tap available capital market platforms to be more capital efficient\", particularly for its property development arm which remains private, unlike its other two listed core businesses.In all dealings, equityIf diversification and innovation mark the group's strategy, equity is what distinguishes its Soilbuild's corporate culture, Mr Lim says. Being equitable underpins the group's interactions with shareholders, joint venture partners, customers, service providers and employees.\"For instance, during the global financial crisis, we understood the banks' concerns and voluntarily did a stress test on all our projects. We initiated a bankers' briefing, where we got all our bankers together to share with them the results. Not one bank withdrew a line then. It reinforced the mutual trust between us and the banks,\" says Mr Lim.It could also mean forfeiting profit. He recounts how a prospective buyer recently placed a cheque with them for a sale unit, an offer that the sales team verbally accepted. So, when another higher offer came in before the issuance of the option, Soilbuild turned it down to honour its word to the first.When it comes to the group's 86 employees (its listed construction arm has another 326 staff, excluding daily rated workers), to be equitable is to \"demand fairly, reward fairly, supplemented by targeted training and soft dosages of a family culture\".\"As Mr Lim's son, I am equally an employee in his eyes the moment I step into the office. Many a times, colleagues look up uneasily as I stand at the receiving end of \"boss to employee\" conversations on deemed performance gaps,\" says the younger Mr Lim.And being held to high standards is needed as the family-controlled business - Mr Lim's brother Lim Han Feng is another of the group's directors - aims to be quick and nimble, as it builds on its foundations in pursuit of growth."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The telco, which is 52 per cent owned by Temasek, jumped to its highest in almost six weeks, hitting an intraday high of S$3.29 before settling at S$3.26, up four cents, or 1.24 per cent.Analysts said the latest rally reflects the market's belief that Singapore blue chips may be undervalued, and that there may be long-term value within them that can be extracted from potential strategic reviews.The restructuring of Keppel, whose interests spans offshore and marine (O&M), property, infrastructure, asset management, urban solutions and telecoms via M1, could cough up many options for other Temasek-related companies as well.Jason Yeo, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who is keeping a \"Buy\" on Keppel and a target price of S$7.40, said: \"Keppel should now be viewed more holistically, amid efforts to transform the business, rather than just as a proxy for the O&M business.\"Keppel surged on this restructuring theme on Tuesday, when its trading halt was lifted a day after Temasek - which has a 20.45 per cent stake in Keppel - said it was offering S$7.35 a share in cash for an additional 30.6 per cent stake in Keppel for a controlling 51 per cent stake. The price represents a premium of 26 per cent or S$1.51 over its last traded price of S$5.84 before trading was halted.Keppel's shares soared as much as 17 per cent, its biggest intraday gain since 1998, on volumes 5.4 times its three-month average, according to Bloomberg data. It eventually closed at S$6.68 a share, up 84 Singapore cents, or 14.38 per cent. A staggering 33.5 million shares worth S$225.6 million changed hands.Keppel led gainers in the blue-chip Straits Times Index (STI), which hit an intraday high of 3,173.70, before ending the day at 3,160.67, up 21.52 points, or 0.69 per cent from Monday.Temasek, one of the largest institutional investors in the world, said it intends to work with Keppel's board to undertake a strategic review to refocus and strengthen certain businesses.The move has fuelled decades-long speculation of a possible merger between Keppel's offshore and marine operations and its rival, Sembcorp Marine. Temasek has a 49.5 per cent interest in Sembcorp Industries, parent of Sembcorp Marine.Sembcorp Industries hit S$2.32 before closing at S$2.23, down six cents or 2.6 per cent. Sembcorp Marine rose to an intraday high of S$1.41, before settling at S$1.35, up a cent or 0.75 per cent.Citi analyst Kwok Wei Chang said: \"The strategic review outcome is likely to be comprehensive, given the possibility of appointing new directors to the Keppel board.\"He reckoned that besides the possible sale of assets, the focus would be on the unit which is deemed to be undervalued, that is, the O&M one.\"Having endured the downturn and taking the necessary steps to streamline the business (mothballing of yards, tailoring of workforce resulting in a leaner cost structure), O&M looks poised to ride the cyclical recovery, driven by improvements seen in the offshore production space.\"He added that Keppel's fundamentals remain unchanged, with the offer of S$7.35 a share creating a price floor for the stock.Ms Yang noted that while Keppel's shares soared, they are still some 10 per cent below Temasek's offer price.\"This reflects uncertainties in closing this deal. Each of the pre-conditions, including gaining regulatory approval, Keppel's financial performance and a majority approval by Keppel's shareholders, needs to be satisfied by Oct 21, 2020, in order for the offer to be made,\" she said.Analysts noted that it is a year to the long-stop date, and market conditions are fluid.Arun George, an insight provider at Smartkarma, said Keppel shareholders would be better placed holding on to their shares as Temasek's offer is far from compelling.\"The deal seems unexciting on a sum-of-the-parts valuation and historical trading multiples,\" he said.Key downside risks for Keppel include a further decline in global oil prices (which could hit demand for offshore drilling equipment and earnings at the O&M unit), an economic slowdown, changes in government policies, sharp interest rate hikes in Singapore or China (which could affect Keppel's property businesses in these countries), slippages in offshore/infrastructure contracts under execution that could lead to penalties/losses, and overpaying for acquisitions."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Now, its become Rotten World. Its very old and worn out, described Chan, co-owner of Kim Loon Colour Photo Co at Beauty World Centre.He was one of its first tenants in 1984. But after more than three decades, some of the shopkeepers there are finding it hard to keep up with the times. And some, like Chan, are calling it a day.Theres a need to renew the place, said the 68-year-old. If you want to renovate the place, everyone has to take some money out Its very difficult to get everyone's agreement.Once the grand dames of Singapores retail sector, strata-titled malls like Beauty World, where many of the tenants own their units, are today living monuments of an era when many of the businesses were passed down to the next generation.But as times and consumer shopping habits change, some of the malls shopkeepers are on their last legs, as the programme On The Red Dot discovers. (Watch the episode here.)NO MORE EMPLOYEESChan inherited his business from his father, who used to operate a film-processing shop across the street, at the old Beauty World site, from 1965 until the move to the current mall in 1984.He remembers the golden era of film photography in the 1980s, when there were plenty of film-processing shops in Singapore. Some who came back after a trip would bring along five to 10 rolls of film to develop, he reminisced.WATCH: End of the road for these Beauty World Centre shops? (5:01)But when digital photography began to pick up in the late 1990s, his business started to suffer, despite its prime location at the entrance of the mall.Now, people print only one or two photos. We wont make much money. Thats why we decided to end the business, he said.He pointed to a Konica printing machine nearby, which was used to develop photographs. It stopped working some six months ago, but he did not bother sending it for repairs there are no more replacement parts for it, anyway.In opting to retire early, he and his brothers managed to sell the shop space for over S$1 million, making a modest profit from the S$700,000 they paid.Im very used to this (working) lifestyle, he added worriedly. When you stop doing it suddenly, you wont be used to it.Then there is shopkeeper Ho Kuek Sian, who also inherited his fathers business half a century ago.Ban Sing Siang Medicine Hall is now on its last legs, reckoned the 80-year-old who had let his last two employees go years ago.Business has declined, so we dont need that many workers, he said. Theres only my wife and my younger brother.When CNA Insider visited him this week during the lunch hour, there were no customers around he was reading some documents on his desk while his brother was wiping the glass cabinets.He, too, spoke about the 1980s and 1990s, when there were more shoppers, especially Malaysians. But then new malls started sprouting up in nearby Clementi and Jurong East.He knows his family business will not last beyond his generation, as his children have shown little interest in taking over from him.Times have changed Its mainly the older generation who consumes these herbs, said Ho. And this is a mall for the older people. Why would the younger generation want to come here?NO ONE BUYINGDespite being stuck in a 1980s rut, the shopping centre has a rich history.The old Beauty World started out as an amusement park and gambling centre during the Japanese Occupation, before it was closed and reopened as Beauty World Market later.A shopping area called Beauty World Town was built beside it in 1962, and the market became popular later, with more than 150 stalls selling textiles, stationery and fresh produce.However, after repeated cases of fire there in the 1970s, most of the stallholders from the expanded market were relocated to the newly built Beauty World Centre, where the first three storeys were reserved for them.Many of the old-timers there have since ceased their trade. Those who are still around like Thomas Lai, who runs Brazil Tailor with his brother know the clockisticking.Right now in the Bukit Timah area, were the only one (tailor). A lot have retired, said Lai. I only have one daughter shes really not interested in this trade.Today, the mall has a mix of old and new trades: There are old-school apparel shops, mom-and-pop stores selling toys, interior design firms, a McDonalds outlet and even a couple of hipster cafes.There is also an open-air food centre on the fourth floor. And while the mall is old, it is clean and well-maintained.When CNA Insider visited on Monday, there was a sizeable crowd of mostly office workers and the elderly, not that it made a difference to, for example, one owner of a florist shop there.You see all these people walking around? Theyre only here for lunch or are window-shopping. Do you see them holding any shopping bags? he sniggered. And true enough, the crowd thinned out after lunchtime.The shopkeeper, who did not want to be identified, has been operating there since the mall opened.He said he makes just enough to get by and is waiting for an en-bloc sale to happen, as competition from new malls has affected his sales.His shop also had no customers during CNA Insiders visit.GENERATION GAPBeauty World Centre Management Corporation chairman Dicky Goh Hui Khoon acknowledged that the mall suffers from low footfall, and his council is trying to attract more people by improving the facilities.The problem with Beauty World is that most of the shopkeepers are getting old. And its a problem attracting more youngsters to come into this building, he said.He even asked his son Malcolm for help, and the undergraduate designed a blog highlighting the shopping centres history.A lot of businesses in this mall have been passed down from different generations to the next. So I wanted to capture the sense of history (and) heritage that this place has to offer, explained the younger Goh.Closer to home, his father faces the same problem as the old shopkeepers there: Finding a successor to family business Hup Soon Department Store, which was first started at the old Beauty World.The 61-year-old now runs the business with his siblings and niece.Its a shame. Its just that, so far, there wont be any takers. My kids are both not interested in this business, he said. I think that this generation, after we finish thats it."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Currently partially tenanted, it is suitable for investment, own retail or office usage, PropNex said.New commercial developments in the region include the 770,000 sq ft, 30-storey Grade A office tower at Guoco Midtown, as well as the new Shaw Towers development.Added Mr Chin: \"Bugis is becoming increasingly attractive to a growing pool of multinational companies based in Grade A office developments DUO Tower, Bugis Junction Towers and the upcoming Guoco Midtown as well as to the millennials who appreciate the diversity in Bali Lane and Haji Lane filled with live local music, coffee places and attractive F&B (food and beverage) establishments.\"It has truly become a 'hip, culturally-rich and vibrant commercial district'.\"Separately, the $4.9 million guide price for 42 Duxton Road translates to about $2,408 psf of floor area, PropNex said.In the vicinity, 37 Duxton Road was transacted earlier in January this year at $5.65 million, or $2,897 psf.The shophouse at 42 Duxton Road has also been zoned \"commercial\". It has a land size of 1,118 sq ft, with a total floor area of about 2,035 sq ft.With retail on the first storey and office on the second, the Duxton shophouse is tenanted to Kokuyo, a furniture and space design company with global offices in China, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. The firm has occupied the premises since 2011, and is looking to stay, BT understands.According to PropNex, the monthly rental of $13,500 represents a rental yield of 3.3 per cent. Said Mr Chin: \"With rental yields generally compressed between 1.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent, this is certainly one of the highest rental yields for a shophouse in the central business district (CBD).\"Duxton is surrounded by three MRT stations nearby, including Outram Park interchange, Tanjong Pagar MRT, and the upcoming Maxwell MRT station, slated to open by 2021.In a statement on Wednesday, PropNex added that Singapore's real estate now offers the best investment prospects in the Asia-Pacific for 2020, following a report by the Urban Land Institute and PwC.Said Mr Chin: \"With the influx of ultra high net worth individuals and institutional funds from Hong Kong and mainland Chinese, our market forecast for heritage shophouses and commercial assets in the city fringe region including District 1 (CBD) and District 7 (Bugis) will continue to rise by at least 5-10 per cent for the next 12 months.\"The tender exercise for 13, 14 Bali Lane and 42 Duxton Road will close at 3pm on Dec 17."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Homes in this section will have private lift access and come with concierge services.The second residential element, called Sereen, will be a 34-storey block with 248 units, including one- to three-bedders spanning 484 sq ft to 1,098 sq ft.The last block - named Leven - is a three-storey building inspired by walk-up apartments in Tiong Bahru and Chip Bee Gardens.Leven, which will feature spiral staircases and a roof terrace, will consist of 21 two-bedroom units that span 807 sq ft to 1,087 sq ft.Prices are expected to range from $2,400 psf to $3,500 psf.One Holland Village will be completed in two phases. The residential zone comprising serviced residences and One Holland Village Residences is estimated to be finished by the end of 2024. The commercial zone should be wrapped up in mid-2022.Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty, noted: \"Holland Village hasn't really had any new retail developments in a long time. So this new development is a timely addition.\"He added that since the area has also seen a recent influx of new condominiums and upcoming residential projects, the retail offerings will also be necessary as the area's population increases in the coming years.\"I think One Holland Village will help to boost the footfall in the larger Holland Village area since it will increase the retail choices for consumers,\" he added.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

More should consider packaging their trophy assets into real estate investment trusts to release capital and improve the market's view of their prospects.The Hang Seng Properties Index has slumped more than 17 per cent from an April high as the unrest disrupted business, deterred home buyers and caused tourists and shoppers to stay away. The broader Hang Seng Index has lost 11 per cent. Many real estate companies are trading at a steep discount to the value of their underlying assets.To understand why developers are trading at a discount, look at the ownership structure. Many are controlled by founding families, who are reluctant to part with their most prized properties. Take Hang Lung Properties, for example. Chairman Ronnie Chan owns more than half the company, which trades at a price-to-book ratio of 0.52 times.As a result of the reluctance to divest, companies end up acting essentially as landlords rather than developers, stunting the potential for growth. In effect, investors are participating in a bond-like structure by collecting rental income instead of achieving an equity-like return via property development and sales.Concern that Hong Kong is at the peak of a property cycle has also helped to depress valuations, with investors discounting developer shares to reflect the risk of a decline. Hang Lung's price-to-book ratio has dropped from a peak of more than 1.8 times over the past decade as Hong Kong real estate prices surged.Spinning off rental properties into trusts, or Reits, could help to narrow the discount to net asset value. Such a manoeuvre would enable family-owned entities to retain control while generating capital from Reit offerings that could be redeployed into better-yielding projects. That in turn would raise return on equity, benefiting owners and investors. The parent company would enjoy higher growth prospects through a relatively asset light model while the Reit provides a steady income stream.Income taxes are the primary obstacle to the expansion of Hong Kong's Reit market. At the moment, Hong Kong property trusts are taxed like corporations at 16.5 per cent. Singapore, by contrast, grants a tax exemption to Reits holding both domestic and foreign properties as long as they pay out 90 per cent of their income in dividends. In 2014, Hong Kong's Financial Services Development Council urged the city's authorities to stimulate the Reit market by introducing a tax break, so far to no avail.That discrepancy has helped Singapore to maintain its lead over Hong Kong as a centre for Reits. Singapore, which issued its first property trust in 2002, has 43 now with total assets of US$112 billion (S$153 billion). Hong Kong's first listing was Link Reit in 2015. Nine more have followed since, bringing total assets to US$67 billion. No new Reits have been issued in Hong Kong since 2013; by contrast, Singapore has seen 11 listings in the past five years.Share performance has also been superior in the South-east Asian city-state. The S&P Singapore Reit index has returned 25 per cent this year, compared with less than 4 per cent for its Hong Kong equivalent. The valuation gap is stark: Singapore Reits trade at about 1.1 times book, versus 0.6 times for Hong Kong.Ronald W Chan is the founder and chief investment officer of investment management firm Chartwell Capital in Hong Kong."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The 1,775 units from the confirmed list sites is 60 units or 3.5 per cent more than the 1,715 units under the second half of 2019 GLS programme.The three confirmed list comprises two private residential sites - including one executive condominium (EC) site in Yishun - and one commercial and residential site in Jalan Anak Bukit in Bukit Timah which can yield about 1,775 private homes (including 600 EC units) and 22,000 sqm GFA of commercial space.Ms Christine Li, head of research, Singapore and Southeast Asia, Cushman & Wakefield, noted that the Government was prudent by \"pushing out a limited number of sites in the confirmed list while leaving the bulk of supply in the reserve list.\"The three sites on the confirmed list is the lowest over the last 5 years, she said. Furthermore, the bulk of units are from the site at Jalan Anak Bukit which will supply 865 units and 20,000 sqm of commercial space.Excluding EC units, there will only be around 1,175 private residential units released in the confirmed list, the lowest since first half 2016 when only 925 private residential units were released.\"While the demand for private housing units has increased in the past two quarters, the overall transaction volume has remained modest relative to the period leading up to the introduction of the property market cooling measures,\" MND said. Meanwhile, developers' demand for residential land remains moderate and there continues to be bidding interest for GLS tenders, it added.Furthermore, the supply of private housing units in the pipeline remains high, at around 39,000 units currently, even though it has declined progressively over the past few quarters, MND noted.This pipeline supply comprises around 34,000 unsold units from GLS and collective sale sites with planning approval, and an additional 5,000 units from sites that are pending planning approval. it added.Therefore, the Government has decided to keep the supply of private residential units on the confirmed list for the 1H2020 GLS programme broadly similar to that for the 2H2019 GLS programme, MND said. Ms Tay Huey Ying, JLL's head of research and consultancy in Singapore, expects the residential site at Tanah Merah Kechil Link to garner the most interest because of its proximity to Tanah Merah MRT Station and its \"palatable housing size\" of 310 residential units. While the Jalan Anak Bukit site is near the Beauty World MRT station, she believes this parcel is the most risky of the three confirmed list sites because of its size. Coupled with the expected high investment outlay, we see this parcel attracting moderate competition from developers with deeper pockets,\" she added.The reserve list comprises four private residential sites (including one EC site), three white sites and one hotel site. These sites can yield about 4,715 private residential units (including 595 EC units), 92,000 sq m GFA of commercial space and 1,070 hotel rooms.The total amount of commercial space available from both confirmed and reserve sites at 114,000 sq m is 24 per cent higher than the 92,000 sq m for the GLS programme in the second half of 2019. The bulk of new commercial space comes from the 78,000 sq m from a reserve list, multi-use white site in Woodlands Regional Centre.It is one of four residential sites, three white sites and one hotel site that have been carried over to the first-half 2020 GLS programme from the previous half-year."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The reopening is also subject to certain official approval.The Festival Walk mall has been closed since Nov 13 after suffering extensive damage in the protests.The loss of retail and office revenue from the damage is expected to significantly hit distribution per unit (DPU) for the six-month period to March 31, 2020.The manager said it will implement a top-up to the distributable income for the third and fourth quarter this year and the first quarter of the 2020-2021 financial year.The top-up is to enable a certain level of distributable income to be made until such time the loss of revenue is recovered through insurance claims, said the manager.The amount, based on approximately 40 per cent of the Festival Walk retail revenue, will be funded by external borrowings.Meanwhile, the manager announced on Wednesday that it is acquiring 98.47 per cent of two freehold office blocks in Greater Tokyo for $482.5 million from Mapletree Investments.The acquisition cost includes fees and expenses of about $4.8 million.The proposed acquisitions have a net property income yield of 4.5 per cent. They have a gross floor area of 180,941 sq m altogether and a net lettable area of 91,583 sq m and an occupancy rate of around 85.9 per cent with 53 tenants altogether.Ms Cindy Chow, chief executive of the manager, said the proposed acquisition of the towers will contribute to the diversification of the trust and reduce the income and asset concentration of Festival Walk.Ms Chow noted that the properties in Japan are freehold and provide a \"relatively higher yield spread against the local cost of funds\" compared to the Greater China market.They also have convenient access to public transport nodes with a \"strong tenant base from a diverse trade mix\", she added. They include information technology, financial and real estate sectors.The property value of the portfolio after the deal will stand at about $8.2 billion, up 6.3 per cent from the existing portfolio of $7.7 billion.The manager intends to finance the acquisition with issuance of units to the sponsor's nominee, a wholly-owned unit of Mapletree Investments, debt financing and internal cash resources."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Just two weeks later, Dyson purchased a hilltop Good Class Bungalow (GCB) with views of the Botanic Gardens for $41m.A $114m buying spree done in a fortnight might look like an aberration were it not for a number of other breathtaking purchases, as seen by the sprawling 84,543 sqft GCB plot in the prestigious Nassim Road area that went for a record $230m ($2,721 psf). Whilst the buyer is reported to be trustee company SG Casa, media has speculated that the buying party was Eduardo Saverin, Facebooks co-founder.Dyson and Saverin are amongst the more prominent ultra-rich individuals looking to own one of their own luxury properties in Singapore, but they are not alone. Foreigners bought over 254 private homes in April to June 2019, up by 46% from the 174 units made in Q1, Colliers latest figures showed. We are still not back to the run-rate before the property curbs a year ago, but the numbers are recovering, saidTricia Song, Colliers International head of research for Singapore, told Singapore Business Review.April to June 2019 alone recorded 139 transactions for properties worth more than $3,000 psfa number that has not been seen since 2007 before the Global Financial Crisis, according to Savills. Cushman and Wakefield also reportedthat foreigners bought 200 units priced at $4m and above between July 2018 when the cooling measures were first announced and up until Junea slightly better number than the 190 units transacted in the preceding period.Stocking up for lossesFor a time, foreigners stepped away from making property investments after the government imposed the cooling measures which increased the Additional Buyers Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates by 5 ppt to 20% for foreigners buying property in July 2018. Only 297 units were sold to foreigners from August to December 2018 compared to the 1,552 units sold in 2017.This was reversed when sales of apartments priced more than $5m rose by 23.25% to 175 units in H1 2019 compared to the 142 transactions in H2 2018, according to Leong Boon Hoe, chief operating officer of List Sothebys International Realty (List SIR), Singapore. The growth in figures comes as no surprise as Singapore is the second-most preferred luxury residential market by ultra high net worth individuals (UHNWI) in APAC and counts amongst the top six globally. About 23% of Asian UHNWIs, or almost 2 in every 5, and 8% of Australasian UHNWIs said that they prefer to buy a home in the island-city, reported Knight Frank.That foreign UHNWIs are willing to pay a hefty duty to buy residential properties here would mean that the price of political serenity is worth more than the 20% duty, said Alan Cheong, executive director of research and consultancy at Savills Singapore. This correlation probably manifested itself when global and regional political tensions mount. Unlike the UHNWIs of the past who bought to preserve their capital, the recent group of UHNWIs are buying for personal and family security and peace of mind.But they arent lining up to buy properties in Singapore for its tranquilitytheyre also bracing up for potential losses, especially affluent Chinese investors. The strong interest from Chinese investors could be attributed to the stability of Singapore currency as a hedge against the impact of the US-China trade war on the Chinese yuan, noted Sze Teck Lee, director and head of research for Huttons Asia. A notable number of affluent mainland Chinese are flocking to the city.Of the Chinese total transactions located at the Core Central Region (CCR) in Q2, 22.6% were for new nonlanded homes and 43% of home resales were worth at least $5m, said Orange Tee & Tie. This stability also plays favourably for foreigners work interests. The rise of the technology, media and telecom (TMT) sector are attracting many companies to set up their HQ in Singapore and move their top talent here, Huttons Lee added.In fact, Dyson moved his headquarters from the UK to Singapore in the heat of Brexit blues, and also for business reasons, having embarked on an ambitious plan to build an electric vehicles for Singapore, with a launch set at 2021. More than 9 in 10 Hong Kong businesses echoed similar sentiments when they chose Singapore as their top choice to relocate operations and capital to, as revealed by a recent survey of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Singapore.Homes as trophiesRich foreigners arent just looking for any home though they want iconic or trophy assets. Housing demand from rich foreigners has become more selective, said Christine Li, head of research at Cushman and Wakefield Singapore. High net worth individuals usually buy homes in the traditional prime districts namely 9, 10 and 11. The exclusivity and prestige that are associated with suchlocalities are often what HNWIs look for.Interest is concentrated in the CCR, with properties costing from $4m or $5m upwards. List SIR reported that of the 169 luxury transactions in the CCR, foreigners and PRs made up 70% of the buyers, compared to 66% and 61% in H2 2018 and H1 2018 respectively.World class architects like Moshe Safdie, the man behind icons such as the Jewel Changi and MBS, are now turning their talents to more plebeian housing projects albeit with luxury price tags of $3,650 per square foot (psf). His Boulevard 88 project on Orchard doesnt seem to have any problem finding buyers even with the lofty price talk, as it had already sold 78 out of its 164 units, with the latest purchase made in October.Of the units sold, 36 were priced over $10m, including a penthouse priced at $5,125 psf or a whopping tag of $31m. This is the highest psf price transacted since TwentyOne Angullia Parks penthouse in June 2013 which sold for $5,560 psf ($42.9m in total), Song said.The 28-storey twin residential tower is reminiscent of Marina Bay Sands with its own Infinity Sky Pool and Sky Lounge. To seal that luxury home living for the price, units are furnished with wardrobes from Italian designer home furniture manufacturer Caccaro with Van Gogh accent marble, whilst the kitchen area is equipped with cabinetry from Italys Ernestomeda Icon series.Armed with these features, the joint development between City Development Limited (CDL), Hong Leong Holdings and LEA Investments successfully bewitched its target market, according to Song. Boulevard 88 was also deemed the most in-demand high-end project in the first half of 2019 as it accounted for 65% or 50 of the 77 units sold above $5m, revealed Ong Choon Fah, CEO and head of research and consulting at EDMUND TIE.Boulevard 88 isnt the only luxury project that had buyers abuzz, as New Futura, designed by Changi Airport 3 architect SOM, sold 113 of its 124 units at a median price of $3,470 psf. JLL Singapore senior director of research Ong Teck Hui noted that a 728 sqm penthouse fetched the highest price of $36.28m at $4,630 psf. The 36-storey residence boasts of an infinity lap pool, aqua beds, cabanas, and a dual level club house.They prefer the neighbourhood close to the Orchard Road shopping boulevard and the neighbourhood close to the Botanic Gardens, said List SIRs Leong. In the new prime districts, these will be Marina Bay, Tanjong Pagar and Beach Road which are in the Central Business District, and Keppel Bay and Sentosa Cove which are the waterfront locations.More new luxury projects near Orchard Road are expected to be launched in H2 2019 and may test the market with new benchmark prices, added Leong. Key projects to watch out for include EDEN by Hong Kong developer Swire Properties, which features private vertical landscape gardens, and Cuscaden Reserve, by a joint venture involving SC Global, Far East Consortium and New World Development."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

In the last few years, Ive worked in both the corporate and startup world, seeing both the pros and cons. To be fair, the statistics paint a compelling picture for Singaporean entrepreneurs.In a survey by GoDaddy there is a massive appetite for entrepreneurship globally, and Singaporean millennials lead the pack. An article showed that up to 74% of Singaporean millennials compared to the global average of 50% working to become their own bosses or be self-employed in the next decade. Singaporeans have shown gumption, with 32% of millennials starting their businesses in school.Singapore has also taken the lions share of investment funding in the region, raising US$7.5b in 2018 across 189 deals, a report from e27 gives more data and insights that place Singaporeans in an enviable position to start successful businesses.However, despite this thriving ecosystem, a sobering 30% of Singaporean startups fail within 3 years.There is safety in climbing the corporate ladder, where you can see the rungs clearly. My first two half-hearted attempts at entrepreneurship working on products and solutions that were inconsequential whilst I was in school did not take off. This humbled me to the effort that was required. I was on a good career path and gave it up. There was always the lure of taking the easy way back to my corporate nest, to call it a day.However, our third attempt was when we looked at solving the issues we personally had with respiratory ailments, and we knew we werent the only ones suffering. We created gush, and we committed ourselves to making it work. We tested the product in our own homes first, then we shared it with our friends and neighbours who gave us great reviews. We had something that if we worked on, could go far. We didnt want to fail, and it was uncomfortable. I embraced the entrepreneurship life wholly, and whilst others say that they never looked back, I do so every now and then and realise I still have to move forward.Here are some of my personal experiences and findings, the intangible considerations that arent as easily summed up into statistics that Im sharing in the hope of shifting the odds in your favour, if you choose the path of the entrepreneur. I present to you the good, the bad, and the realities of being an entrepreneur.The good1. At my last corporate job, there was a hierarchy in place, and that meant limited access to different levels of people. The latitude shifted up and down, the levels of conversation I had were dependent on the rank and role of both myself, and the people I wanted to get in touch with. Being a startup founder, I found myself being able to speak on an even playing field (despite being on a lower playing field as a growing startup).2. Flexibility and autonomy opened up the possibilities we could embark on and explore in spades. It was giddying and a different change of pace where the red tape and long decision-making processes were cut short. We could make decisions quickly in tandem with changing market forces.3. The satisfaction of building something with our own hands. From the beginning when we saw what we had as a concept get developed, seeing the initial wave of validation, to opening our doors commercially. Best of all was knowing that we could turn our complaints into a legitimate business idea, and could inspire those around us to do the same.The bad1. Many of the benefits of the structures and hierarchies in our old life had to be either relearned or self-taught to fit the challenges and needs of our company. What was the growth structure of our company going to be like? Could we be releasing our product too early, or too late? Are we expanding too fast? Are these the right partners that can bring us to the next level? This process never ends, and we had to adapt to recovering whilst being on our back foot.2. I kissed work-life balance/integration goodbye and said hello to constantly having work on my mind. Granted, Im slightly OCD, so that does work to my advantage. Unfortunately, I find this approach necessary to stay on top of things. Ironically, the red tape that we found liberating could be the safety net preventing us from over-extending ourselves.3. The circle of friends that I used to have has shrunk considerably. Though I know that is an inevitable part of life as we get older, I have lost more friends than I would have liked to, as a result of my choice to be an entrepreneur. Mealtimes and time spent after hours with people become mostly work and business-driven. It is a lonely path, and though I have to accept it, I dont think Ill ever get truly used to it.The realities1. The amount of work you put in compared to the gains you get can be discouraging. Some days, sometimes it feels like nothing works, until it does. I have learned to quietly celebrate every little victory, and to take every bit of failure as part of the process.2. In Singaporean society, there still is the stigma of entrepreneurs who fail, leaving many skeptical. Yet the romantic lure of entrepreneurship has turned it into a trend, and the statistics show that we are being overcrowded with pointless startups. Dont get into this journey because it is trendy, it is paramount to know the difference you can make.To the aspiring entrepreneur fresh out of school with a head full of dreams, and the disillusioned corporate worker who thinks that the grass is greener on the other side - it isnt.Entrepreneurship will almost never work for you if you choose to dabble. Fail often, fail fast, if this is the path for you, itll be one of the best decisions youve made, if not, there is no shame in being a speed climber on the corporate ladder."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It's about building experiences and memories, and the joy that comes from that.\"The China-born Ms Tang, who graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Literature from China People's University for Police Officers - now known as People's Public Security University of China - has lived in Singapore for the last 25 years and is a permanent resident.She serves as executive director of trading and investment firm Tang Dynasty, which she founded together with spouse Gordon Tang back in 1995, as well as managing director of real estate and investment holding firm, Haiyi Holdings, which the couple established in 2003.Therefore, it's not surprising she subscribes to the \"not just Chinese, but very Asian\" mentality of wanting to own property.\"It's everyone's dream to own his or her own home - this is something tangible that lasts. For some it marks a coming-of-age milestone, and creates a sense of belonging. This is why property ownership is a long-term trend that will never die out,\" she said.Venturing into property development and investments in the city-state was also a no-brainer.\"We are no strangers to the real estate business. Investing in and developing properties - both in China and the US - has very much been a part of our family tradition,\" she added.\"In terms of socio-economic and political stability, as well as standards of living such as healthcare and education, Singapore remains a gem within the Asia-Pacific region. Property values here will definitely appreciate. It's just a matter of how quickly, and in what time frame.\"So when the opportunity presented itself, the Tangs used Haiyi Holdings - whose Chinese characters mean \"smooth sailing at sea\" - to take over listed vehicle SingXpress Land in 2012, by subscribing for the latter's cumulative convertible perpetual preference shares.The following year, the company was renamed SingHaiyi Group, and four years later, it was transferred to SGX Mainboard from the Catalist board.Diversity and stabilitySingHaiyi has a current market capitalisation of about S$380 million. In the year-to date, the stock has generated a total return of 9.9 per cent, compared with total returns of 8.9 per cent and 10.6 per cent for the benchmark Straits Times Index and the broader FTSE ST All-Share Index respectively.Haiyi Holdings owns a controlling 63.06 per cent stake in SingHaiyi, in which Neil Bush - Tang's business partner and brother of former US president George W Bush - serves as non-executive chairman.Ms Tang, who was appointed group managing director of SingHaiyi in December 2013, also holds non-executive chairman roles in SGX-listed OKH Global and Chip Eng Seng Corporation.Apart from an established track record in residential property development, SingHaiyi also owns a diversified portfolio of income-generating assets in the commercial and retail sectors, spanning the US, Australia and Asia.The group's presence in different real estate segments across multiple markets provides a stable earnings profile, as well as maximises shareholder value.It is building a portfolio of quality projects, having completed six development properties since 2013, including the Building and Construction Authority's Conquas Star-rated City Suites and award-winning The Vales, as well as the Pasir Ris One \"Design, Build and Sell Scheme\" project that has since been fully sold.The group has a pipeline of another five developments in Singapore and the US scheduled for completion by 2024.It optimises its portfolio through yield-accretive acquisitions and divestments, having made seven development project acquisitions since 2013.It divested its stake in Singapore's TripleOne Somerset building with a return of more than 60 per cent within three years.The group also diversifies its income through strategic investments, including a 2.59 per cent stake in Cromwell Property Group, and a 25 per cent stake in Malaysian malls via the limited partner of ARA Harmony Fund III, through which it receives quarterly dividends.\"Such indirect stakes provide us with the avenue to study and understand the dynamics of different markets, as well as assess the potential of future investments should those opportunities arise,\" Ms Tang said.Buck stops hereSingapore remains the group's core market. The current pipeline of projects in the city-state include the 9 Penang Road commercial and retail development, which has obtained Temporary Occupation Permit, and secured UBS Singapore as its sole office tenant.It also has three residential projects - The Lilium and The Gazania, both unveiled in May this year, and Parc Clematis, which launched in August and is the group's largest development to-date.Apart from bottom-lines, Ms Tang is equally, if not more, uncompromising about SingHaiyi's reputation in the industry.\"For any company, especially a publicly listed one, generating a profit is important,\" she said.\"Beyond that, the nature of the real estate business demands not only quality, but also integrity. For example, when the market is in a slump, developers may be tempted to cut corners and use fixtures or parts that are inferior in quality, so as to reduce cost and boost margins. That's a no-no for us.\"The group has a philosophy that underpins its efforts to build a trustworthy and reliable brand for enduring growth, and a legacy that will span generations, she added.\"Your word must always be your bond. What is paramount is upholding the trust that customers place in you, and keeping our promises with our products,\" she noted.The main challenge is making sure all levels of the organisation adhere to this principle.\"There are many moving parts - from the main contractor to engineers, architects and suppliers. The alignment of the group's objectives across each stage - from design and execution to submission and sale of the project - is critical,\" she added.Ultimately, the buck starts and stops with SingHaiyi. \"If something goes wrong, the customer doesn't care who made the mistake. It starts with us, and ends with us, because we built it.\"In October 2018, Ms Tang was the first female recipient of the \"Singapore Real Estate Personality of the Year\" Award, conferred by Southeast Asian real estate portal PropertyGuru.Price and locationIn Singapore, private home prices continued to climb in the third quarter of 2019, after hitting their highest levels in at least five years in the previous quarter, according to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority.Demand for private homes in Singapore will likely pick up in the medium term, DBS Research said in a report published in September.This is expected to be driven by government measures to boost affordability in the public housing market, such as the Enhanced CPF House Grant, as well as higher household income ceilings for purchase of new HDB homes.Last month, a report jointly published by the Urban Land Institute and PricewaterhouseCoopers ranked Singapore pole position for real estate investment prospects in 2020, vs second-to-last in a list of 22 centres back in 2017.Singapore was also one of the few markets regionally to see a surge in transaction values in the first half of 2019, with most of the activity driven by cross-border capital.Despite a relatively optimistic longer term outlook for the domestic market, challenges remain.\"Property prices have not moved in tandem with the increase in construction costs, and coupled with slower demand over the past few years, developers have not had an easy time,\" Ms Tang said.\"Land prices in Singapore are also extremely high due to the scarcity factor, and as a result, we've been more prudent in choosing our projects as well as purchasing land bank - the site must have the right price and the right location.\"The regulation that imposes a levy on developers who don't complete construction and sell all units in the project within a period of five years from acquiring the land is another stumbling block, she added.In particular, it takes a substantial amount of time for collective acquisition projects to be approved, which has to be accounted for within the five-year period.Wait and seeA supply overhang also continues to plague the local market. The number of unsold units from new projects doubled to 4,377 in the third quarter, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its annual Financial Stability Review last month.This increase could be exacerbated in the medium term, as developers redevelop and launch projects following the slew of en bloc sites sold between 2017 and 2018, the MAS noted.On the demand side, many buyers are adopting a wait-and-see approach after the government's latest round of cooling measures last July, which included higher buyer stamp duties and tighter loan limits.\"This is one challenge we cannot overcome, and every developer faces the same obstacle. We have huge turnouts at our launches and showrooms, but it's difficult to get buyers to commit,\" Ms Tang said.No matter how savvy a developer's marketing strategy may be, broader buying sentiment still plays an overriding role.\"The stiffer buyer's stamp duty is a major psychological barrier, and the question in every buyer's mind is: 'Are these duties temporary or permanent? What happens if I make the purchase now, and some or all of the cooling measures are relaxed or rolled back months later?\" she added.While market dynamics and project sales are never far from her thoughts, Ms Tang also frets about cultivating the right values in her two sons and a daughter, aged 19 to 25.\"Usually, first-generation entrepreneurs are the ones who worked hard and got by with very little during the early years. The second generation - their children - are the ones who grow up in a privileged background, and are likely to develop a sense of entitlement,\" she pointed out.\"I want my children to know that we work very hard to provide them with a foundation, and this foundation is for them to build on - to create something of their own - and not an excuse for them to be lazy and ask for handouts.\"The 52-year-old also finds herself grappling with the phenomenon of FOMO, or the fear of missing out, common among millennials and Gen Z.\"I tell my kids that life is a long journey - don't be impatient to succeed or in a hurry to prove yourself. If you miss out now, you could get another chance later,\" she said. \"But in the case of uncertain investments, it's better to deal with a lost opportunity rather than a mistake.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Industrial real estate rents in Singapore were generally stable in 2019, although the sector was weighed down by oversupply from preceding years, says Christine Li, head of research, Singapore and Southeast Asia, at Cushman & Wakefield (C&W). Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore at Colliers International, agrees. She says that compared to 2018, the overall industrial property market has shown clearer signs of stabilisation, with both rents and vacancy rates remaining relatively stable in the year to September. Both net demand and net supply are expected to have increased in 2019. But looking ahead, Li says the industrial outlook for 2020 could be gloomier compared to this year. She says global macroeconomic factors, such as slowing economic growth in the US, the EU and China, is likely to have a negative impact on Singapores economy in 2020. The subdued global economy is expected to moderate industrial rents next year, she adds. Newly completed industrial space doubles in 2019 This year, close to 12.5 million sq ft of net new industrial space is expected to have been completed, which is more than twice the 5.84 million sq ft of net new completions in 2018, says Song. Net new demand is also expected to have increased by 50% y-o-y to 11.0 million sq ft in 2019, she adds. For 2020, the largest new industrial development that will be completed is the Defu Industrial City at Defu Street 1. JTCs flagship stackup complex at Defu Industrial Park will have a total gross floor area (GFA) of 3.52 million sq ft. Other sizeable new industrial developments in 2020 include JTCs TimMac @ Kranji boasting 1.54 million sq ft in GFA, and JTC Bedok Food City with 1.13 million sq ft in GFA. Over in the one-north business park district, homegrown gaming hardware company Razer is expected to open its purpose-built, 207,743 sq ft headquarters building next year, while ride-hailing giant Grab is due to move into its 387,000 sq ft purpose-built headquarters building by 4Q2020. Two-tier leasing performance in factory segment Based on CBRE Researchs basket of industrial properties, factory and warehouse rents remained steady at $1.57 psf per month (pm) and $1.58 psf pm respectively in 4Q2019. Looking ahead, warehouse rents are expected to be more resilient, supported by a tight supply pipeline, says Desmond Sim, head of research, Southeast Asia, at CBRE. But he adds that industrial occupiers were looking for premises with higher specifications and better efficiency. This contributed to a two-tier leasing performance by the factory segment in 2019, as industrial developments with higher specifications outperformed older, conventional industrial buildings. The 10.5% vacancy [in the factory segment] in 3Q2019 included a growing pool of vacant, ageing industrial stock of about 53.85 million sq ft. This spurred several landlords to undertake asset enhancement initiatives on older industrial stock in a bid to unlock value by repositioning and redeveloping assets with under- utilised gross floor area, he says. According to Colliers, these enhancements include increased power capacities, high-floor loading capability, modern ventilation and cooling systems, higher ceilings and better loading bay facilities. Redevelopment could also enhance connectivity between adjacent buildings and to transportation nodes. According to Song, landlords feel it is the right time to adopt smart features such as automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity and space efficiency, and reduce operating costs. In general, leasing demand in 2019 was driven by renewals and relocations of companies in the third-party logistics, high-tech manufacturing, and chemicals sectors. The electronics sector took a backseat in 2019 when the US-China trade war escalated, and the sector was also hit by an economic dispute between Japan and Korea, CBREs Sim says, adding that some industrialists are taking a cautionary stance and limiting expansion plans. According to Colliers, third-party logistics companies, transport agencies, e-commerce, and manufacturing companies were the top occupiers of warehouse logistic spaces this year. Companies in these sectors accounted for close to 74% of occupied islandwide warehouse space. as well as business parks segment High-spec premises such as business parks also recorded a two-tiered leasing performance in 2019 as the market split between city-fringe and suburban submarkets. City-fringe business park rents climbed 0.9% y-o-y to $5.85 psf pm, but suburban rents fell by 1.3% y-o-y to $3.75 psf pm, based on JTC statistics. We continue to see a flight to quality in the business parks sector, says Colliers Song. We observe that new business park spaces near MRT stations in the city fringe continued to attract healthy demand, while those older and further away from MRT stations located in the suburbs faced more difficulty in finding tenants, despite lower rents. The biggest deal of the year was Mapletree Commercial Trust acquisition of Mapletree Business City II from its sponsor Mapletree Investments for $1.55 billion. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) She adds that the rent disparity could widen going forward, as centrally-located business parks with good amenities are expected to record rental growth, while rents in older business park spaces could remain flat over the next few years. C&Ws Li says that with office rents near the peak, cost-conscious occupiers are choosing to locate at business parks as an alternative to the CBD. The segment saw improved absorption of 452,000 sq ft during the first three quarters this year, she says. The specs of newly completed business parks are almost no different from that of Grade-A offices which can compete for the same tenant pool if such tenants qualify for both business park and office spaces. That could help to put a lid on the rental upside should there be more decentralised office supply in the pipeline, Li adds. However, decentralised office supply does not necessarily cannibalise the business park demand, as they offer different specifications, eco-systems and different value propositions for different types of tenants, says Colliers Song. Reits dive into specialised assets Industrial investment activity has been relatively healthy in 2019, clocking in deals worth about $2.99 billion. The biggest deal of the year, in terms of transacted prices, occurred in November when Mapletree Commercial Trust acquired Mapletree Business City II, a premium campus-style business park development, from its sponsor Mapletree Investments for $1.55 billion. The second largest deal was in September, when Keppel DC Reit acquired a 99% stake in Keppel DC Singapore 4 for $381.1 million. The Reit also acquired a second data centre, 1-Net North DC, for $201.8 million. In November, Ascendas Reit acquired two business-park properties, Nucleos and FM Global Centre, from its sponsor CapitaLand for a combined value of $380 million. In April this year, CapitaLand sold the group of companies that own and manage the self- storage business StorHub, for $179.5 million. This comprises StorHubs portfolio of 12 self-storage properties with a total lettable area of about 800,000 sq ft. The largest industrial leasing deal in 2019 was Googles expansion into Alexandra Technopark, taking up 344,100 sq ft (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore) Meanwhile, the largest industrial leasing deal in 2019 was Googles expansion into Alexandra Technopark, taking up close to 344,100 sq ft of industrial space. The development is adjacent to Googles Asia-Pacific headquarters in Mapletree Business City II. Another notable leasing deal occurred in January when e-commerce firm Shopee leased all 240,000 sq ft at 5 Science Park Drive, a redevelopment of the former Fleming and Faraday buildings by Ascendas-Singbridge, for its expansion needs.
