In 4Q22, 486,000sqm of new supply of industrial space was added to the market. This has been the largest quarterly supply addition seen in FY22 and the largest quarterly increase in supply in over five years. Total new supply of more than 1.3m sqm was added to the market in FY22 - significantly more than the average new supply of c.875,000sqm per annum in the past five years. Although we saw a spike in new supply in FY22, it was less than half the c.2.8m sqm in new supply that JTC originally projected at the start of the year. This means that some of the new supply in FY22 has been further delayed, with JTC now forecasting a total of c.1.8m sqm of supply to be delivered in FY23. A bulk of this will again come from the single-user factory segment (49%), while warehouse supply constitutes 28%, and the multiple-user factory and business park segments make up the remaining 23%. Although there was a spike in new supply in FY22, the demand of c.733,000sqm was relatively in line with the demand seen over the past five years. As such, the negative net absorption led to a slight 0.8ppt decline in the overall occupancy rate for industrial space. The negative net absorption was most pronounced in 4Q22, which coincided with the largest delivery of new supply in FY22. With the delivery of new supply expected to remain on an upward trajectory in the coming year, we could see further negative net absorption rates and continued pressure on the overall occupancy rates for industrial space (currently at 89.4%). Rental Index continues to inch up despite the pick-up in delivery of new supply. Despite the faster pace of delivery of new supply and negative net absorption rates, the Rental Index continued to inch up to 97.7. During the year, the Rental Index increased by 6.9%, the fastest pace seen in over a decade. Every industrial property segment saw an increase in its respective rental index, with the multiple-user factory and warehouse segments reporting the strongest y-o-y increases of 8.3% and 7.9%, respectively. What are we watching? Take-up rates of industrial properties. With the pick-up in new supply in FY22, we saw negative net absorption in three out of the four quarters last year. Only the warehouse segment continued to report positive net absorption in the whole of FY22, while for the other three segments it was negative, and the worst performer was single-user factory space (c.-442,000 sqm). Although the decline in occupied space was caused mainly by the single-user factory segment, we also noted that demand for the warehouse and business park segments slowed down in FY22. In our view, the slowdown in the take-up rate could likely be attributed to economic uncertainties and businesses delaying expansion plans due to rapidly rising costs as well as higher interest rates. Although we understand that tenant demand from the biomedical, precision engineering, high-tech manufacturing, and logistics sectors continue to remain robust, we are keeping a close eye on how sustainable demand will be as we enter FY23, with economic conditions becoming more uncertain. Historically, the logistics and high-specification industrial segments tend to outperform and remain more resilient during periods of economic uncertainty, and we are expecting this trend to re-emerge going forward. Will the protracted weakness from single-user factory space flow down to other segments? As evident in FY22, the single- user factory space reported negative net absorption for more than two consecutive years. Over the past 10 quarters, the negative net absorption was a function of the spike in new supply, as well as declining occupied space. With a further c.1.8m sqm of new supply in single-user factory space expected to be delivered in FY23 and FY24, it could put further downward pressure on existing stock.

This is a result of a rollover in project completions from the last three years, as the COVID- 19 pandemic led to construction delays and disruptions to supply chains. * As compared to the start of FY22, it seems like the completion of c.1.0m sqm of new supply has been rolled over to FY23, even as construction delays and supply chain disruptions ease. * Slightly more than 1.3m sqm of new supply was completed in the whole of FY22. This was the highest level of completion seen in over four years. * Approximately 1.8m sqm of new supply is expected to be delivered in FY23, with the single-user factory space contributing 49%, likely to have been developed by industrialists for their own use. * Delivery of new warehouse space in FY23 will constitute 28% of the supply, potentially easing the strong demand seen in FY21 and FY22. * Multiple-user factory space and business parks make up another 23% of the upcoming supply. * Take-up of multiple-user and warehouse spaces has been healthy so far in FY21 and FY22 with positive net absorption, despite the delivery of new stock.

Spike in new supply in 2022 led to negative net absorption Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * Net absorption in FY20 and FY21 were positive due to the delays in construction and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. * Although the amount of new industrial supply in FY21 was more than twice the amount seen in FY20, pent-up demand and expansion needs led to a slightly positive net absorption in FY21. * The positive net absorption in FY21 came from the multi-user factory and warehouse segments, partially offset by the negative net absorption from the single-user factory and business park segments. * With the spike in new industrial supply (c.1.3m sqm) that hit the market in FY22, we saw negative net absorption. The negative net absorption was mainly contributed by the single-user factory segments, while the other segments like warehouse and business parks reported a slowdown in take-up. * In the medium term, we expect net absorption to continue to stay in negative territory, leading to the softening of occupancy and rental rates, unless demand in FY23 surprises on the upside. 11.1% 10.7% 10.8% 10.1% 9.8% 10.6% 11.1% 11.4% 5.0% 6.0% 7.0% 8.0% 9.0% 10.0% 11.0% 12.0% (8.0) (6.0) (4.0) (2.0) - 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F m' sqft Net Absorption Rate Market Vacancy Rate (%) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 6 .

However, we expect the trend to reverse in FY23 due to limited new supply. * The positive rental reversion cycle continued into FY22 for the warehouse and factory segments, owing to strong demand, despite the pick-up in the increase of new supply. * Overall rentals in the near term are expected to continue to remain healthy, even as more new supply is expected to come online. * Over the last two years, the logistics sector has been driven by the advancement of e-commerce and stockpiling activities.

Industrial Sub-sector - Multi-User Factory Multi-user factory supply: Supply spike in 2022 due to construction delays in previous two years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * New completions picked up in FY22 after more than three years of construction delays. A total of 634,000sqm of new supply of multi-user factory space was delivered in FY22, the largest increase in annual supply in over a decade. * Despite the spike in supply, take-up of multi-user factory space was very strong. A total of 442,000sqm of space was taken up in FY22, thereby cushioning the increase in the vacancy rate. The vacancy rate in FY22 was 10.9%, only a 100bps increase. * The sudden spike in both supply and demand in FY22 was likely a result of construction delays over the past three years and pent-up demand from businesses waiting to occupy the newly completed projects. Although we saw a slight increase in vacancy rates in FY22, overall occupancy is still at a very healthy level, the strongest seen in over a decade. * We are expecting another year of healthy supply for the multi-user factory space, with an estimated 322,000sqm of new supply projected to come online in FY23. Demand is also expected to taper off, as we believe most of the pent-up demand has already been satisfied. * We could see a slight increase in vacancy rates unless demand picks up and available stock is backfilled at a faster pace. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F 2025F '000 Sqm Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 8 . Multi-user factories: Surprise rebound in occupancy rate despite delivery of more stock Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * Rentals surprised on the upside with a c.6.9% increase despite the spike in new supply delivered. This was likely due to cost inflation as well as higher rents that the newer multi-user factory commands. * As anticipated, occupancy rates dipped slightly due to the spike in delivery of new supply. Occupancy rates dipped 110bps in FY22 to c.89.1%, but this is still at a multi-year high. Aside from the past three years (where new supply was constrained by construction delays), occupancy rates are currently at a level last seen in FY13. * We expect some downward pressure in occupancy rates going ahead, as the market has to gradually backfill the bumper crop of new supply in FY22. Rents could also see some downward pressure, but we believe it will remain relatively sticky in the near term. * However, occupancy and rents could surprise on the upside if there is any further slowdown in construction, and new supply continues to be rolled over to the following years. 85% 86% 87% 88% 89% 90% 91% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023f 2024f 2025f 1Q18 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 S$ psf pm Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 9 .

Insights & recommendations * Notwithstanding a slight drop in overall occupancy from 89.7% in Q3 2022 to 89.4% this quarter, both the JTC industrial price and rental indices continued their ninth consecutive quarter of growth. * The rental index rose by 2.1% q-o-q, maintaining its pace last quarter. This marks a 6.9% annual growth for 2022, making it the fastest y-o-y rental growth since Q3 2013. The price index rose by 1.7% q-o-q, easing from the 2.0% q-o-q growth last quarter. This marks a 8.5% annual growth for 2022 and would make it the fastest y- o-y price growth since Q2 2013. * Colliers expects rental growth to moderate to between 1 to 3% for this 2023. On the other hand, industrial prices could increase at a higher clip of between 3 to 5% due to sustained interest in industrial assets with their higher yields and limited availability. There should also be more sale and leaseback activities as companies look to free up some capital.

This also makes multiple-user factories stand out as the segment with the highest rental growth, as occupiers seek office grade industrial spaces. However, the rental growth and demand for factories is likely to slow on the back of a weaker manufacturing outlook and a higher supply pipeline. Nevertheless, there will continue to be new biomedical and semi- conductor facilities, on the back of government efforts to attract multi-nationals to set up their manufacturing hubs in Singapore. 2 All Industrial Property The slight drop in overall occupancy of 0.3% in Q4 2022 was due to the pickup in new completions. This led to new supply exceeding new demand, with new supply coming in at 5.24 mil sf, (the largest quarterly increase since Q4 2017), while net demand came in at just 2.89 mil sf. The same narrative applies for full year 2022, where total supply (14.12 mil sf) exceeded total demand (7.89 mil sf). Warehouse Warehouses registered an annual rental increase of 7.9%, with occupancy tightening to 91.7% from 90.8% in the previous quarter. Colliers has observed that the demand for warehouse space has not abated, supported by end-users, third-party logistics players and food manufacturers. Specifically for prime logistics and temperature-controlled warehouses, there is a shortage of suitable stock to meet demand. As such, prime logistics rents are set to continue their steady climb on the back of limited supply and strong pre- leasing rates for this upcoming supply. Business Parks Business parks rents have started to exhibit some sustained growth, despite higher supply and vacancy rates. Newer, higher specification developments in the city fringe are still observed to have tighter vacancies and resilient rents. This has led to some occupiers moving to business parks further away to reduce operating costs. Over the next few years, rents and occupancies are likely to be dampened by a significant supply coming onstream, coupled with weakening demand, particularly from the tech sector.

The warehouse segment might be an exception to this trend, as there appears to be a dearth of supply post 2024, and where pre- commitment to existing pipeline supply is high. Economic indicators such as Singapore's manufacturing output, NODX and PMI are collectively pointing towards a manufacturing slowdown and weaker demand. Against the backdrop of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates which lead to higher capital costs, sentiments will inevitably be affected, leading to more industrialists becoming more cautious about their leasing plans. On the other hand, as some companies will want to free up capital, they might turn to leasing instead of acquiring or owning their own industrial space. Consequently, Colliers expects rental growth to moderate to between 1 to 3% for 2023, though warehouse rents might continue to outperform on the back of tight supply. On the other hand, industrial prices could grow at a faster pace of between 3 to 5% on the back of growing interest in industrial assets due to their higher yields and limited availability. 0.40 18.9 18.0 1.4 4.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0 18.0 20.0 2023F 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F Estimated GFA (mil sf) Warehouse Business Park Single-user Factory Multi-user Factory \"The consistent growth in rents has attracted institutional investors looking for higher yields, propping up demand for industrial assets.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast A Slower 2023 Singapore's economy grew by 3.8% yoy in 2022, significantly lower than 2021's growth of 7.6%, according to advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade & Industry. Q4 2022 GDP growth slowed to 2.2% yoy, as compared to 4.2% yoy growth in the prior quarter. The slowdown was due to a contraction of the manufacturing sector, weighed down by lower output from the electronics, chemicals and biomedical manufacturing clusters after robust growth in 2021. Nonetheless, wholesale & retail trade and transportation & storage sectors continued to grow by 2.3% yoy in Q4 2022. Given a darkening economic outlook amidst persistent inflation pressures and higher interest rates, Singapore's economy is forecast to grow by 0.5% to 2.5% in 2023. While the United States and Europe, Singapore's key trading partners, heads towards an economic slowdown, the re-opening of China could provide a surprise on the upside for Singapore's economic growth. Performance Continues to Bifurcate Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, rentals across most industrial asset classes remained stable during the last quarter of this year, except for business park and high-tech space which rose. Both city-fringe and outlying business park rents went up in Q4 2022 with the former experiencing higher growth rate due to relatively tight vacancy rates. Landlords have also increased their rent expectations due to higher property operating costs. Similarly, high-tech rents inched up by 0.4% q-o-q as leasing demand was supported by high-value manufacturing sectors as well as some spillover demand from CBD office market. For the whole of 2022, prime logistics outperformed, enjoying highest rental growth of around 6%, bolstered by digital transformation, e- commerce and inventory stockpiling, while other segments also experienced steady growth. However, a weaker economic outlook and sharp rent increases in prior years would lead to increasing tenant resistance and slower rental growth in 2023. Performance across industrial property types is expected to bifurcate. New economy assets such as prime logistics, high-tech warehouses and city-fringe business parks are expected to outperform, with full year rent growth of 1.5%-3% in 2023 amidst tight supply conditions and resilient long-term demand from e-commerce, life science and technology. Conventional factories and outlying business parks are expected to see slower growth of up to 1.0% next year, given a higher supply pipeline. Nonetheless, those newer and higher spec developments would outperform older stock.

Based on the Economic Survey, the Singapore economy expanded by 4.2% y-o-y in Q3 2022, a slight moderation from the previous 4.7% y-o-y growth in Q2. Nevertheless, as recession fears grow, the outlook has clouded business sentiments. After eight quarters of consecutive quarterly GDP growth in the manufacturing sector, with expansions above the 5% level, the increase in Q3 was markedly less pronounced and substantially slower at 1.4% while a negative 3.0% was recorded in Q4 2022. The drop in global demand for semiconductors impacted the electronics segment, and overall declines in the chemicals and biomedical clusters stymied growth in the second half of the year. As risks stemming from economic headwinds mount, business sentiments in the manufacturing sector remained negative for the period October 2022 to March 2023 according to the Singstat Q4 2022 Business Expectations Survey. In contrast to the previous period (July to December 2022), when a net weighted balance of 8% of manufacturing firms anticipated a less favourable business outlook, this percentage rose to 20% in the latest survey as the industry remains beset by continued supply chain disruptions and a prolonged Ukraine-Russia conflict. Accordingly, the contraction in the overall Singapore Purchasing 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in October and November 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against July and August 2022) and y-o-y (against October and November 2021). Knight Frank Research Reports are available at knightfrank.com.sg/research Manager's Index (PMI) that began in September 2022 continued at 49.7 in October, 49.8 in November and 49.7 again in December 2022. Fewer deals transacted in Q4 Led by a hazier economic outlook and the dampening of business sentiments, industrial sales in the final quarter came up to S$715.1 million, the lowest since Q2 2020 when sales grossed some S$324.8 million due to the onset of the pandemic. Apart from the major sales of a two-storey ramp-up warehouse, Enterprise Logistics Centre, in Tuas for S$120.6 million in November, and 10 and 12 Mandai Estate for S$100 million in December, about 97.2% of the caveats lodged in Q4 2022 were deals below S$10 million. Industrial space owners are increasingly adopting a cautious stance, with expansion plans placed on hold until there is more clarity in the unfolding global economic situation. With the flow of material for production inconsistent, businesses related to electronics do not expect improvement until after mid-2023. While sales activity slowed, leasing transactions remained relatively stable in the months of October and November 2022 with businesses in general manufacturing, construction-related manufacturing, transport engineering and precision engineering continuing to expand cautiously.

And although manufacturing FAI dropped significantly to S$411 million in Q3 2022 from the S$3.6 billion in Q2 2022, pharmaceutical facilities, semi-conductor production plants and data centres are being constructed in the industrial supply pipeline. During the quarter, semi-conductor companies Applied Materials announced a S$600 million 700,000 sf plant in Tampines Industrial Crescent to be ready in 2024 that would double its manufacturing presence in Singapore, while Soitec broke ground on a S$571 million extension to its Wafer Fab Park in Pasir Ris. Singapore will also have five new vaccine producing facilities, set up by pharmaceutical firms Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sanofi, BioNTech, Hilleman Laboratories and MSD. Additionally, data centre operators Digital Realty and Equinix were reported to be looking to expand in Singapore by applying to develop new data centres, after a moratorium issued in 2019 to pause the release of land for data centre use was lifted. Market outlook The manufacturing and industrial real-estate outlook turned cautious in the latter half of 2022 due to rising interest rates, continued global supply disruptions and the challenging times faced for the technology sector. Even though the electronics sector is going through a rough patch, investments continue to flow into Singapore with the belief that growth will return and be sustainable in the long-run. These in turn create demand for local Singapore enterprises. As such, industrial prices and rents will remain stable with a marginal growth of 1% to 3% for the whole of 2023. In the logistics segment, where supply is tight, rents for quality warehouse space might increase by a higher 3% to 5% in the year ahead.

Growth in the fi nal quarter was largely attributed to the expansion in the construction sector and services producing industries. The manufacturing sector however, contracted from the output decline in the biomedical manufacturing, chemicals, electronics and general manufacturing clusters. As such, Singapore's economy expanded 3.6% for the whole of 2022, down from the 8.9% in 2021, when Singapore emerged from the economic slump in 2020 due to the pandemic. The manufacturing and construction sectors, along with the services producing industries recorded YoY growth of 2.5%, 6.7% and 4.8% respectively. For the manufacturing sector, all clusters expanded, except for the chemicals and biomedical manufacturing clusters. From September 2022, when overall factory activity began contracting, the weaker sentiments in the manufacturing sector persisted arising from weaker global demand and a slowdown in the global economy. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remained in the contraction territory for the fourth consecutive month, with the PMI declining marginally by 0.1 point to 49.7 in December 2022. The negative sentiments in the manufacturing sector was also felt with the continual contraction in Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX), which fell further by 20.6% YoY in December 2022. RENTAL MARKET Leasing volume1 continued trending downward in Q4, albeit at a moderated pace at 3.5% YoY, bringing the total number of transactions to 2,948 tenancies. In the quarter, fewer tenancies were signed across all property types. Leasing demand for factory spaces slowed further in Q4, but at a more muted pace, with leasing transactions for single- and multiple-user factory segments falling by 15.5% and 1.2% YoY respectively. For the warehouse sector, leasing volume recorded the second consecutive quarter of yearly decline with a much larger 9.4%. As such, the total leasing volume for the whole of 2022 fell 4.4% YoY, the fi rst decline recorded since 2011 when leasing transactions declined 20.0%. The decrease was largely arose from the single- and multiple-user factory spaces. In a similar light, the vacancy level for single-user factory grew for the sixth consecutive quarter by a larger 0.7 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.9% in Q4. This was likely to be due to the addition of 2.73 million sq ft of new supply, as well as some relocation among industrialists. 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). Signifi cant increases in vacancy rates were observed in the East (1.3 ppts) and North (2.6 ppts) Planning Regions. For the multiple-user factory segment, while its islandwide vacancy rates continued to increase, the rise was a marginal 0.1 of a ppt QoQ, to 10.9% in Q4. The large increase of 2.7 ppts in the North Planning Region was largely off set by the declines in vacancy levels in the East (-0.9 of a ppt) and North East (-1.8 ppts) Planning Regions. On the other hand, the warehouse vacancy level declined 0.9 of a ppt to 8.3% in the quarter, a reversal from the marginal 0.1 of a ppt increment in the previous quarter. This was partially due to a contraction in supply. Vacancy rates in all the Planning Regions were observed, except for the North Planning Region that recorded a 2.8 ppt increase. The overall industrial rents continued the upward trend for the ninth consecutive quarter in Q4, with JTC's rental index for multiple-user factory spaces increasing 2.6% QoQ, the largest quarterly increase since Q3/2013 when the rental index expanded 4.4%. The rental index for single-user factory spaces rose in the quarter as well, increasing 1.3% QoQ, a slightly moderated pace compared to the 2.0% in the previous quarter. The annual growth in 2022 of 4.1% and 8.3% in the JTC rental index of single- and multiple-user factory spaces respectively were the highest since 2012 when the rental index rose 12.9% and 9.6% respectively. For warehouse rents, the JTC's index continued to rise on a QoQ basis, surpassing the highest level attained in the previous quarter to 92.8 in Q4. This was a 2.2% increase QoQ, the highest quarterly increase since Q4/2013 when the rental index grew 3.4%. Savills' average monthly rents for prime multiple-user factories2 remained unchanged in Q4 at S$2.01 per sq ft, after increasing for the past seven consecutive quarters. On the other hand, the healthy leasing demand and a shortage of quality facilities led to Savills' average monthly rents for warehouse and logistics properties3 to continue rising, increasing 1.3% QoQ to S$1.53 per sq ft in the quarter. SALES MARKET Following the decline in Q3, strata industrial sales activity4 across all segments continued to fall in Q4. For the quarter in review, there were 432 transactions. The global economic uncertainties and slowing manufacturing sector may have led to investors being cautious on their purchasing decisions. Strata warehouse sales fell further to 23 deals in Q4. 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 13 February 2023.

Similarly, the sales volume for multiple-user factory declined 18.7% QoQ from 503 in Q3 to 409 in Q4. Nevertheless, industrial sales prices still trended up in Q4, picking up the pace of increase from the previous quarter. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for 60-year leasehold and freehold industrial properties rose by 2.4% and 2.3% QoQ to S$474 per sq ft and S$776 per sq ft respectively in Q4. Apart from the longer remaining tenure and nature of freehold leases, the rise in prices was driven by the strong price growth for food factory properties. Similarly, Savills' basket of industrial properties pointed to 30-year leasehold property prices increasing at a faster pace of 2.0% QoQ to reach S$314 per sq ft in Q4. This may be due to stronger interest among some businesses/investors favouring properties of lower price quantum when they wished to mitigate the risks from rising economic uncertainties and elevated price volatility. Given that values are inversely proportionate to lease tenures, the 30-year industrial leaseholds benefi tted from this. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL In the last quarter of 2022, business park recorded the largest increase in vacancy rate across the industrial property segments. The vacancy level for this segment of the industrial market rose 2.7 ppts to 17.5%. This was largely contributed by a 9.3 ppts in vacancy levels in business parks in the West Region. In particular, vacancy rates in International Business Park (IBP) surged 12.8 ppts from 24.5% in Q3 to 37.3% in Q4. Apart from the weaker connectivity to main transport nodes, the higher vacancy levels were also attributed to the partial completion of Perennial Business City in the quarter. Apart from the performance at IBP, the vacancy levels at one-north and Changi Business Park (CBP) grew 0.8 of a ppt and 0.5 of a ppt respectively in the quarter. For CBP, the increase in vacancy rate came after a 1.3 ppts decline in vacancy level in Q3. Business parks that are not as well-connected to major transport nodes and do not have quality features may be less favoured by tenants. Hence, landlords will need to reduce their rents to try to shore up the occupancy. This was evident when we look at the monthly rent from Savills' standard business park properties5. They fell 1.1% QoQ after two consecutive quarters of increase to S$4.00 per sq ft in Q4. However, Savills' prime business park6 monthly rents declined marginally by 0.3% QoQ after fi ve consecutive quarters of growth to S$5.91 per sq ft in the quarter. High-spec industrial rents continued rising due to increasing occupier demand as businesses who qualify to located into industrial buildings look for such buildings with an offi ce look and feel. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. the push for a holistic food-related infrastructure. With strong support from the government, it should on paper lead to an increase in demand for higher quality food facilities, both by local and international players. On growth in the Logistics and Supply Chain industries, this ties in with the point on Building Resilience to Supply Chain Disruption. Over the past three years, global supply chains have been put through a series of severe tests. Companies are having to deal with huge demand volatility triggering short and varied cycles of decision making. Also, with manufacturing activity breaking out into regional clusters (instead of being concentrated in certain countries), supply chains will be redrawn. With the lessons learnt from the pandemic and future lessons likely to be learned from the on-going re-routing of global supply chains, diff erent companies are responding in varied ways - from securing supply at any cost to building inventory stockpiles and re-aligning supply markets to avoid future disruptions. Although economic conditions are becoming ever more challenging by the month, the outlook for industrial and logistics facilities here should be driven by a tug of war between companies which can adapt to the new clime of advanced manufacturing, food and novel food customer services and modern supply chain management versus those which struggle under the changing circumstances. On top of this, one has to be mindful of the pandemic induced supply backlog coming on line in 2023 and this should provide additional choices for end-users. On balance, we believe that given the strong demand for logistics and food factory space plus an environment where heightened infl ation will continue to infl uence monetary measures, rents in 2023 are expected to rise.

OUTLOOK The key themes surrounding the industrial and logistics (warehousing) sector for 2023 are expected to be: 1. Infl ation 2. Building Resilience to Supply Chain Disruption 3. Cost Control For points 1 and 2, it is ultimately likely to lead to greater stocking up as end users attempt to hedge against both rising cost and potential breaks in the supply of goods. Obviously, this is a positive on industrial and warehousing space demand. On the matter of cost control however, it could be a negative on demand. As economic challenges grow and the tech sector restructures to move into a new phase of growth, companies may feel the need to scale back on overheads like labour and rents. On the demand side, the industries which are expected to do well this year are: 1. Advanced Manufacturing 2. Food and Novel Food Consumer Services 3. Logistics and Supply Chain Although the manufacturing and warehousing sectors are expected to face a tug of war between infl ation-supply resilience versus cost control, there are bright spots including industries such as those listed above. Activities involving information communication technology (ICT), automation, computation, 3D printing (additive manufacturing), sensing, and networking, are expected to expand in volume. Industries in electronics, semiconductors, robotics, pharmaceuticals, medical products, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and aerospace engineering are expected to be the drivers contributing to the economy, driving demand for high spec industrial spaces.
