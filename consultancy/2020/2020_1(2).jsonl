This led to rising vacancies, which put downward pressure on rents in 3Q20, for the third consecutive quarter. Capital values, however, held steady in 3Q20 as Singapore's office market continued to record interest from funds, developers and ultra-high net worth individuals looking for investment opportunities in safe havens like Singapore. The protracted nature of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to weigh on business sentiment and rents for the rest of 2020 and 2021. Nonetheless, pockets of strength remain, such as Chinese technology companies looking to expand and/or set up bases in Singapore. Delays in project completions due to COVID-19 related disruptions to construction work should also help to cushion rent corrections. Residential Prime home sales volume rebounded in 3Q20, supported by pent-up demand from buyers who had been constrained from purchasing during the circuit breaker period and phase 1 of the economy reopening. The collective sales market remained at a standstill, with no collective sales deal concluded in the Prime sub-market in 3Q20 for the third consecutive quarter. Despite significant pickup in market activities during the quarter, prices of completed prime private residential properties continued to decline at a faster pace due to cautious buying sentiment and more realistic pricing from sellers amid the negative macroeconomic outlook. Likewise, there was a greater correction in rentals in 3Q20 compared to 2Q20 as leasing demand continued to be dampened by the recession and weak labour market. Rents are expected to continue facing downward pressure in the next 12 months due to weaker leasing demand, resulting from the worsening business conditions affecting wages and employment of expatriates.

Tourist arrivals stayed dismal due to strict travel restrictions. Despite the economy reopening, retailer sentiment remained weak as border restrictions, safe-distancing measures and cautious consumer spending weighed on retail sales. Vacancy rates continue to rise as unsustainable businesses cease operations. Consequently, rents for prime floor space fell on a q-o-q basis across the three sub-markets in 3Q20. Investment activity picked up in 3Q20, with shophouses contributing the bulk of the transactions. Retailer sentiment will remain subdued as tourism demand is not expected to recover in the short-term, and continued safe-distancing measures will reduce operational capacity. With government relief measures coming to an end, some retailers are expected to succumb to the pressure of cash flow constraints, pushing up vacancy rates in the short term. Rents are expected to fall amid rising vacancy rates over the next 12 months. Warehouse Demand stayed healthy in 3Q20, supported by both short-term users (some of whom have extended their leases) and end-users with expansion and relocation requirements. Against this demand backdrop, logistics/warehouse rents held firm in 3Q20, for the second straight quarter. This, in turn, supported capital values, which remained steady during the quarter. A major warehouse transaction in 3Q20 was the sale 7 Bulim Street by Titan (Wenya) Pte Ltd to AIMS APAC REIT for about SGD 129.6 million. The four- storey ramp-up logistics facility with a 30-year lease commencing from 1 September 2012 is entirely occupied by master tenant KWE - Kintetsu World Express (S) Pte Ltd. Rents are likely to hold relatively steady over the next 12 months, underpinned by anticipated healthy demand, while yields could compress in a low interest rate environment.

INDUSTRIAL GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER LED BY SPIKE IN ELECTRONICS TA N B O O N LE O N G , E XE CUTI VE DI RE CTOR, I N DUSTRI AL , CAPITAL M ARKETS According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry's (MTI) Economic Survey of Singapore, the economy shrunk by 13.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2 2020, a clear deepening of the recession from the 0.3% decline in the previous quarter. The contraction came as a result of the continued effects of the pandemic reverberating across all industries, as nations temporarily shut their economies and borders, resulting in weak external demand for goods. However in Q3, the industrial sector returned to growth led by the electronics cluster. The Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reported expansions since July, with September the most recent at 50.3. Optimism was lifted by the growth in the electronics non-oil domestic exports (NODX) in Q3, and as such the Electronics Sector PMI in September registered an expansion of 50.9. The recent expansions in Electronics PMI in August and September follow six months of contraction from February to July. The spike in demand for digital products and semiconductors largely attributed to this growth. The anticipated growing requirements of the 5G network are expected to continue to support the demand for chips worldwide. Despite the looming uncertainties, foreign companies are still looking to expand their operations in Singapore. The third quarter saw the entry of several global firms, with Zoom Video Communications opening a new data centre in August and Hyundai Motors announcing plans to occupy the industrial space previously left vacant by Dyson at Bulim Avenue. Given the nation's stability and resilience in the face of external headwinds, Singapore will continue to be a favourable destination as a hub for companies worldwide. With sustainable solutions and digital platforms becoming increasingly important and critical for businesses to adopt, demand for industrial spaces that cater to such uses is projected to expand in the short to medium term. Additionally, as more office users restrategise their space requirements with the rising trend of working from home, business parks stand as one of the alternative options for cost- conscious qualifying occupiers. The median rent of multiple-user factory spaces island-wide decreased slightly by 1.4% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) and 2.2% on a y-o-y basis to S$1.75 per-square- foot per month (psf pm) in the third quarter (Exhibit 1). Leasing volume for such industrial space totalled 1,577 transactions in July and August, amounting to S$5.7 million, representing a decline of 34.4% y-o-y as the strong challenges faced during the circuit breaker and economic uncertainties continued to subdue substantial movements in the leasing market. Additionally, the greater availability of space options in the multiple-user factory space segment is characterised by competition among landlords for tenants where rents tend to be more volatile during times of recession. The average price of multiple-user factory space remained largely stable across most tenure categories in Q3 2020. Prices of units within developments with less than 99 years left in the lease remained relatively flat as manufacturers were hesitant to relocate or expand into newer factories at higher prices (Exhibit 2).

SINGAPORE VIEW 22ND EDITION As at end-June 2020, some 53.7 million sq ft gross floor area (GFA) of industrial space is slated to come on stream from Q3 2020 to 2024. Of these, about 26.7% of the upcoming developments are projected to be completed in the remaining half of 2020, with the majority comprising factory space. While certain segments of the industrial sector have shown signs of recovery in the third quarter, there is still much prevailing uncertainty that continues to threaten segments such as the transport engineering cluster. However, this will be mitigated by the manufacturing segments such as the electronics cluster as well as companies that produce hygiene or health-related products, which have proven resilient in propping the industrial sector. Overall, industrial rents and prices are not expected to moderate downwards by more than 5% for the whole of 2020 despite the current recessionary environment."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

According to advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the economy expanded by 7.9% QoQ in Q3, compared with a 13.2% QoQ contraction during the lockdown in Q2. On a yearly basis, the economic performance also improved to -7.0% in Q3, easing from -13.3% in Q2. This came on the back of a 2.0% YoY recovery in the manufacturing sector, reversing from the -0.8% YoY growth in Q2. This was fuelled by the pick-up in global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which drove the output of electronics and precision engineering clusters. Following the sluggish performance of the manufacturing sector in Q2, sentiment turned positive in Q3. After fi ve months of negative readings since February, the overall Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is back in expansionary mode for three consecutive months, suggesting a more upbeat economic backdrop amid a gradual reopening of the economy. This was coupled with positive momentum in Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX), which continued to expand through Q3, albeit at a slower pace in September. RENTAL MARKET As Singapore began Phase 2 in its reopening of the economy in June, leasing activity in the industrial market picked up. There was a sharp increase of 27.7% YoY in leasing volume1 to 3,005 transactions in Q3, a record since the data was constituted in 2000. (Graph 1) This was largely lifted by a spike in leases for multiple-user factory spaces (+16.6% YoY), which hit a new all-time high of 2,405 transactions in Q3. We believe that this could be due to tenant relocation amid enhancement works of their previous premises, as well as downsizing plans as part of cost-cutting measures. Also, some of the leasing demand could have come from the smaller ecommerce players, who needed more space to manage the surge in last mile delivery services. Compared with the same quarter last year, leasing demand for single-user factory spaces continued to rise by 1.2% in Q3, albeit at a slower pace than the preceding quarter (+14.5% YoY). While rental demand remained stable from last year, more single-user factory tenants and owners, who operate in multiple facilities, started to consolidate their operations and 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). put up vacant facilities for lease or sale. Meanwhile, the warehouse segment saw a 4.0% QoQ dip in tenancies signed in Q3. Even though stockpiling pushed demand for warehouse space, warehouse leasing demand began to moderate as some companies in the performing industries, such as the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors, are combining their operations into a single build-to-suit (BTS) facility for greater operational effi ciency. Coupled with the increase in volume of single-user factories up for sale combined with softer price levels, some companies are considering acquisition of a single-user facility to house their operations under one roof. The overall industrial vacancy level eased for two straight quarters in Q3, coming off by 0.2 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.4%. Besides limited new completions due to delays in construction work during the lockdown period, the occupancy level was largely supported by the spike in storage needs, particularly in North-East and North Planning Region where warehouse vacancy fell to the lowest levels since 2018 and 2016 respectively. JTC's rental indices continued to weaken across all segments in Q3 as pandemic-led recession exerted downward pressure on rental levels. According to Savills basket of properties, the average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 slipped by 0.8% QoQ to S$1.71 per sq ft. On a positive note, the warehouse and logistics3 segment performed better in Q3, with Savills average monthly rents for prime warehouse and logistics properties reversing a short-lived decline to register a 0.9% QoQ increase to S$1.42 per sq ft. Even though JTC's warehouse rental index continued to fall in Q3, prime and modern warehouse facilities helped to support the overall rental growth in light of strong demand for storage and logistics space. SALES MARKET Total strata sales volume more than doubled from Q2 to 372 in Q3, a reversal from a four- quarter decline which begun in Q3/2019. It was mainly lifted by an uptick in strata sales for multiple-user factory and warehouse properties, such as Mega@Woodlands and Oxley Bizhub. The demand could have come from fi rms, particularly in printing as well as event organising, who are downsizing their real estate footprint. Furthermore, some companies in healthcare and the aquaculture industry (i.e. frozen seafood) are also looking 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.40 per sq ft.

Although there is a growing buying interest among automotive players, especially when there are more single-user factories up for sale, most of them did not translate to actual sales as the prospects are still waiting for better off ers before the lease expiry of their current premises. While some owners maintained their price expectations, particularly for freehold assets, data from JTC showed that overall industrial prices fell by 2.2% QoQ in Q3, making it the largest decline in the last four consecutive quarters. Similarly, Savills' basket of leasehold industrial properties4 also continued to register declining prices in Q3. Prices for 60-year leasehold properties fell at a moderate pace of 0.9% QoQ to S$425 per sq ft, while that for 30-year leasehold properties fell by 2.2% QoQ to S$301 per sq ft due to depleting lease terms. As there is a scarcity of freehold industrial stock available currently, especially in prime locations, freehold industrial prices held fi rm, recording a marginal rise of 0.2% QoQ to S$694 per sq ft. BUSINESS PARKS AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Having stayed in the negative for the fi rst two quarters, the business park segment regained strength in Q3, with net demand improving across all regions. As a result, islandwide vacancy eased by 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 14.6% in the reviewed quarter. (Graph 3) This could have arisen from fi nancial institutions taking up new business park space for their back-end operations while reducing their offi ce space in the Central Business District. Nonetheless, landlords' pricing power was lower with the JTC rental index for business park dropping yet again by 1.0% QoQ in Q3. This is likely to be weighed down by the older business parks which saw a further softening of rents. Concurrently, Savills basket of standard business park properties5 showed that the average monthly rent weakened again for a second quarter, albeit at a slower rate of 0.4% QoQ to S$4.05 per sq ft. As most landlords of prime business park space maintained their monthly rental expectations of at least S$6 per sq ft, the average monthly rent in Savills basket of prime business park properties6 remained fl at from the previous quarter at S$5.81 per sq ft.

Meanwhile, it is also challenging for landlords to increase rents for renewals as some existing high-spec industrial users are considering relocating to other light industrial space if capable of projecting a good corporate image, with offi ce-like specifi cations and in areas with good connectivity such as Paya Lebar. As such, the average monthly rent for Savills high-spec industrial basket7 inched down marginally by 0.2% QoQ to S$3.47 per sq ft in Q3. OUTLOOK Come spring 2021, as economic and social activity gradually resumes in advanced economies after the winter lockdown measures, overall economic conditions should begin to improve. For 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expected a less severe global economic downturn (-4.4%) this year in its latest report than the previous forecast in June. Nonetheless, the slower than expected reopening and the reinstatement of another shutdown amid a resurgence in virus in some countries could motivate the IMF to lower their growth expectations this year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also expected a modest pace of economic recovery in Singapore for the coming quarters in the face of a potential resurgence in worldwide infections which will drag on external demand. While MAS forecast a more modest pace of economic momentum in the last quarter of the year, the government maintained its economic forecast for between -7.0% and -5.0% YoY for this year. The consensus amongst private sector economists has GDP contracting by 6.0% YoY in 2020. Local economists are now veering towards a U-shaped recovery scenario for Singapore with 2021 GDP growth coming in at 5.4% YoY. This is reasonable as the lockdown in Q2/2020 followed by a phased opening of the economy thereafter has stymied domestic economic activity greatly. Therefore, as the economy opens further, GDP growth should signifi cantly increase in 2021 given the low base this year. The sharp contraction in the Construction and Services sector (part of the Services sector which constituted 65% of 2019's GDP) is very likely to reverse with similarly sharp increases albeit we may not see a return to pre-COVID levels in 2021. (Graph 4) Drilling down to the manufacturing sector, it has been performing surprisingly well with Q3/2020 GDP Manufacturing 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft.

Notwithstanding negative GDP growth, which came mainly from the Construction and Business & Services sector, the Manufacturing sector did surprisingly well with a 5.7% YoY growth for the fi rst three quarters of 2020. For the full year, manufacturing growth could come in at 5.6% YoY. The sub-sectors which contributed to the sharp increase were from biomedical, pharmaceutical, semiconductor and the electronics manufacturing. (Graph 5) The stellar performance of some sub-sectors within the manufacturing sector has dampened the pricing and rental downside. In fact, on the logistics front, most warehouses here are fi lled to capacity and some spillover demand has been seen in traditional light industrial space. Consequently, activity levels in this real estate market have held up well. Looking ahead, despite growing interest in the industrial sales market from businesses in booming industries such as healthcare and aquaculture, the conversion rate to actual sales is likely to remain subdued because of the gap which exists between buyer and seller expectations. On the rental front, although the leasing market is expected to stay active in the coming months, it is coming from more businesses seeking to consolidate and reduce space as part of their PERIOD YoY % CHANGE IN MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY RENTS YoY % CHANGE IN WAREHOUSE & LOGISTICS RENTS 2020F -3.0% to -1.0% 0.0% 2021F -3.0% to 0.0% +1.0% to 3.0% TABLE 1: Rental Forecast For Multiple-User Factory And Warehouse & Logistics Segments Source Savills Research & Consultancy cost-saving plans. Even though further delays in projected completions are expected, overall occupancy levels are likely to remain depressed in the near term. Industrial prices and rents will continue to be negatively impacted by Small & Medium Sized Enterprises as the pandemic has hit them hardest. Although there is increasing consensus that the economic recovery could be U-shaped, the economy is unlikely to return to pre-COVID levels soon. While the more resilient segments, including business parks, high-spec industrial and logistics space, could possibly fi nd some support to occupancy and rental levels, the recovery has not been even across all segments. For tenants in such premises, most will rather pay a premium for better-maintained properties in prime locations with better connectivity, hence sustaining the positive take-up and rents of prime properties. On the other hand, older properties in the outskirts are expected to continue to see softer demand and weaker rents. In the coming quarters, the exception to the general industrial and business space market is logistics where we are beginning to see warehousing rents starting to stabilise and even rise marginally in some cases.

According to Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in Q2 2020 Singapore's economy shrank by 13.2% YOY and 42.9% QOQ (seasonally adjusted annualized), the worst quarter on record. The manufacturing and Information & Communications (Infocomm) sectors were among the most resilient, having contracted only 0.7% and 0.5% YOY respectively. Manufacturing has been and will likely continue to be supported by the biomedical, electronics and precision engineering clusters, while the Infocomm sector will benefit from firms' continued demand for IT and digital solutions. Based on Colliers' data, as of June 2020, average monthly factory gross rent fell by 1.4% HOH to SGD1.65 (USD1.18) per sq foot. Business park rents decreased by 0.4% HOH to SGD4.35 (USD3.13) per sq foot while independent high-spec industrial buildings saw monthly rents also falling 0.3% HOH to SGD2.93 (USD2.10) per sq foot, as COVID-19 dampened business sentiment and leasing activities. With increased demand soaking up excess vacant space, warehouse-logistics' average monthly gross rent flat stayed flat HOH at SGD1.23 (USD0.88) per sq foot. Based on data from JTC, all-industrial occupancy increased by 0.2 ppt HOH to 89.4% as of June 2020, as more warehouse space was leased for stockpiling and ecommerce activities during the pandemic. While we estimate half of the 15.4 million sq ft expected completions in 2020 could be delayed (due to COVID-19 lockdowns) and thus alleviate fears of a supply glut, the supply pipeline remains ample at about 14 million sq feet (1.3 million sq meters) per annum 2020-2022, before tapering off in 2023. We estimate 84% of the H2 2020-2024 supply is factory space, while the remaining 16% is warehouse space. ...but will still be under pressure While warehouses have benefited from increased ecommerce and stockpiling during COVID-19, we note that there is still ample available stock. As vacancy continues to improve below its current 11.7% level, we expect warehouse rents to stabillise in 2020 and pick up from 2021 onwards, led by ramp-up logistics space. We expect general factory rents could fall 3% in 2020, while business parks and hi-specs space could edge down 1% in 2020, as industrialists pause expansion plans and recalibrate or pivot their space requirements in view of the weak trade and economic conditions.

OFFICEThe impact of COVID-19 weighed heavily on Singapore's economy. Across an array of industries, businesses are tightening their belts and cost containment continued to be a key focus. BUSINESS PARKSAmid the ongoing economic uncertainties, the business park market displayed signs of resilience. The value proposition of business parks for occupiers still remains. RETAILLeasing volume slowed down significantly in Q2 2020, negatively impacting new to market and expansion activities. The number of closures escalated in Q2 2020, mainly confined to the F&B and entertainment sectors. RESIDENTIALQ2 2020 saw the months of April and May undergone a \"circuit breaker\" period where no showflats were allowed to open, contributing to a lower showing for the quarter. INDUSTRIALLeasing activity picked up towards the end of the quarter especially for prime logistics, which lent support to overall warehouse rents.

COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Act 2020 Loan and cashflow support A Timeline of Events in 2020 MARKETVIEWOn the back of the COVID-19 fallout, real estate investment volume in Singapore for Q2 2020 came to S$2.129 bn, a 23.2% drop from the previous quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of decline in investment volume.The office sector was the outperformer, coming in at 61.9% of investment sales. Two major deals propped up office volume: the sale of a 30% stake in 111 Somerset and a 50% stake of AXA Tower.On the other hand, residential sales dropped 80.4% q-o-q, due to viewing restrictions and the absence of government land sales activity. Retail investment sales have also been affected, with deals initiated before the outbreak.Despite the absence of public land sales, industrial volume remained robust with several sales to end-users, a sale and leaseback deal, as well as a warehouse purchase by DWS.Prices have declined slightly due to the poor outlook in rents and occupancy. However, there is still no distress selling due to the limited supply of prime assets and holding power of landlords/asset owners. With gaps in buyer-seller price expectations widening, some deals have fallen through. Nevertheless, there is a general acceptance that distress sales are unlikely, especially in the office sector where prime stock remains limited. Foreign investment volume increased from the last quarter due to the two mentioned office transactions. However, market activity this quarter was muted attributed mostly to the movement and travel restrictions put in place.Nonetheless, the lifting of these restrictions is likely to unleash some pent-up demand: deal volume is expected to pick up with foreign high net-worth individuals and family offices looking at strata offices. In addition, there are also a handful of commercial assets with redevelopment potential on sale offered at palatable prices that may be concluded.Shophouses, together with the hospitality and retail sectors will remain the hardest hit, with banks increasingly reluctant to finance these assets. The gradual relaxation of travel restrictions and pace of tourism market recovery will be key as investors become more selective.

Across an array of industries, businesses are tightening their belts and cost containment continued to be a key focus. As a result, more firms are pushing to downsize their current footprint, either through renewals or relocations. Notwithstanding, there were some signs of leasing activity from the insurance and technology sectors. In Q2 2020, islandwidenet absorption was -293,040 sq. ft., which was adjusted to account for the removal of Keppel Towersand Keppel Towers 2. At the same time, two buildings obtained TOP in Q2 2020, which were 79 Robinson Roadand a strata-titled building, CentriumSquare. After the completion of these buildings, new office supply will be limited for the rest of 2020, with only Afro-Asia i-Mark and St James Power Station in the pipeline.Vacancy rates in the Core CBD and Decentralised submarkets increased q-o-q. This led to an increase in islandwidevacancy from 5.0% in Q1 2020 to 5.6% in Q2 2020. It should be noted that the increase in Core CBD vacancy stemmed from the transitional vacancy in 21 Collyer Quaywhich is undergoing asset enhancement initiative works, and the available space resulting from the completion of 79 Robinson Road. In Q2 2020, office rents corrected for the second consecutive quarter. Grade A (Core CBD) office rents fell 3.0% q-o-q to $11.15 psf/month. Grade B (Core CBD) office rents declined by 2.3% q-o-q to $8.45 psf/month which suggests some resilience in this submarket. Looking forward, vacancy levels are likely to rise; there is a growing volume of secondary space that resulted from the relocations of major occupiers.

At the same time, occupier activity was rather limited, mainly stemming from technology firms absorbing space in the City Fringe submarket. This resulted in a furthering tightening of vacancy in the City Fringe submarket which offset the increase in vacancy in the Rest of Island submarket. Consequently, business park vacancy remained at 13.1% in Q2 2020. Amid the ongoing economic uncertainties, the business park market displayed signs of resilience. The value proposition of business parks for occupiers still remains, with their efficient floorplates and cost competitive alternative to offices. Rents for City Fringe and Rest of Island business parks maintained at $5.85psf/month and $3.75psf/month respectively this quarter.CBRE Research's analysis indicates that there is currently 2.37 mil sf of business park space in the pipeline; 55.0% is pre-committed. Evidently business park products in the Rest of Island submarket are evolving, with most of the upcoming space available for lease located in Jurong Innovation District. Furthermore, the repositioning plans of International Business Park will contribute to this transformation, supported by new MRT infrastructure which will boost accessibility to this location. Business park rents are expected to display some form of resilience. The tight supply is expected to lend support to rents in the City Fringe submarket. This is due to the appeal of the business park sector as a lower cost alternative and the resilience of its pool of qualifying tenants. Despite occupiers exhibiting stronger preferences for newer business parks in the City Fringe submarket, the tight vacancy in this submarket may prompt occupiers to turn to the Rest of Island business parks. In particular, cost-conscious occupiers looking to trim costs and seek a decentralised location.

Although enquiries from international retailers are coming through, many are putting their plans on hold amidst business uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tenant retention has been challenging. The number of closures escalated in Q2 2020, although this has been mainly confined to the F&B and entertainment sectors. KidzaniaSingapore announced that they will be closing permanently and will not be reopening upon the lifting of \"circuit breaker\" measures. International retailers who may be experiencing cashflow difficulties are also considering downsizing their store footprint, placing a higher priority on their better performing stores in higher footfall locations. Landlords have begun lowering their rental expectations as they place priority on maintaining occupancy. This is particularly so for malls in areas that have poorer footfall in the Fringe and CBD locations. Average prime islandwide retail rents this quarter experienced a larger decline of 1.8% q-o-q, as compared to -0.6% in Q1 2020. That said, rental correction has been more severe for secondary locations and floors, with some even experiencing double digit q-o-q declines.To date, rental corrections for prime malls has been relatively muted, partially offset by rental rebates granted to tenants via government reliefs. Some proactive landlords have also offered marketing assistance to provide additional relief to tenants. Islandwide vacancy rate reached 10.6% in Q1 2020. It should be noted that landlords are currently statutorily not allowed to terminate or evict tenants affected by the pandemic. In addition, retailers who are considering pre-terminating are finding it difficult to source for a replacement tenant. It will be imperative for landlords and tenants to work closely together during this challenging retail environment, particularly when the government support expires.

Despite that, new home sales volume continued to clock in at 277 and 486 units in April and May 2020 respectively. Following the reopening of project sales galleries on 19 June 2020, new sales volume continued with 883 caveats lodged in June 2020, to total the quarter at 1,646 units. Majority of units sold came from balance units from prior launches such as KOPAR at Newton, The Florence Residences and Treasure at Tampines. Nonetheless, it represented a lower showing for Q2 2020, which could be attributed to an absence of major project launches, as developers chose to defer their launch dates.Though transactions were mainly for units of lower quantum below $1.5 mil, there were also buyers looking for opportunities in the luxury market. The low interest rate environment and volatilities in the equity market may have motivated some buyers back into residential investments, which have long been regarded as a relatively more stable option. Sales have also been motivated by some developers that has been observed offering discounts and incentives.The URA flash estimate price index of private residential property for Q2 2020 decreased 1.1% q-o-q, which marked its second consecutive quarter of decline. RCR registered the largest drop of 1.9%, following a slight compression of psf prices as developers attempt to clear remaining inventory. Moving forward, we expect developers to be more competitive in their pricing, due to a slew of projects that are expected to launch in Q3 2020 as well as from unsold inventory of developments that are slipping closer to their ABSD deadlines. CBRE Research believes that H2 2020 could see a larger price correction amidst slower economic growth and prices could correct by 5% to 8% for the whole of 2020. While property sales volume may not match up to previous years, there will still be an underlying demand to help soak up balance units, and new home sales volume may hit 5,000 to 6,000 units in 2020.

However, the manufacturing sector showed some form of resilience with an advance estimated growth of 2.5% y-o-y in Q2 2020, supported by a surge in biomedical output. Nonetheless, manufacturing output fell by 7.4% y-o-y in May following two consecutive months of increase, and NODX declined by 4.5% y-o-y in the same month after three consecutive months of increase. Meanwhile, PMI demonstrated improvements since recording its historical low in April and rose to 48.0 in June; however sentiments remain in contraction territory. Leasing activity picked up towards the end of the quarter especially for prime logistics, on the back of government stockpiling and heightened demand during the \"circuit breaker\" period from e-commerce, food logistics and third-party logistics players. Anecdotal evidence has shown players involved in last-mile delivery setting up short-term fulfilment centres to meet the rise in e-commerce demand. This has eventually compressed overall prime logistics vacancy.The spike in demand for prime logistics has spilled over to traditional warehouse spaces, thereby boosting overall warehouse rents. Preliminary estimates showed that both ground and upper floor warehouse rents rose by 0.8% q-o-q in Q2 2020. On the flipside, the factory market remains two-tier -while there has been demand for buildings with higher specifications, market conditions appear to be weighing down on older non-high-specs buildings, which form a larger proportion of overall factory stock. Consequently, both ground and upper floor factory rents declined by 2.0% q-o-q in Q2 2020. As demand for prime logistics spaces continues to demonstrate strong growth, CBRE Research expects warehouse rents to improve steadily in the latter half of the year, while factory rents may prove to be less resilient against an unfavourable economic climate.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Singapore Economy to Enter Services-Led Recession Singapore's overall economic growth turned negative at -0.7% yoy in Q1 2020. However, the downturn was attributed to the services sector, as the manufacturing sector posted positive growth of 6.6% yoy. The government expects the country to enter into its deepest recession ever, with full-year overall economic growth in the range of -7.0 to -4.0%. While both the overall PMI and electronics PMI remained in contractionary territory, the easing of the circuit breaker and the lifting of lockdown restrictions across the globe led to an improvement in sentiment. This resulted in the overall PMI recording a slight increase of 1.2 to 48.0, while the electronics PMI saw a larger increase of 1.4 to 47.6 in June. Non-Essential Manufacturers Hit By Circuit Breaker Manufacturers for non-essential items were heavily impacted by the circuit breaker as they were required to halt operations. As a result, manufacturing output was reduced during this period. The biomedical sector is the brightest spot in manufacturing with strong growth as demand soared for key medical supplies such as COVID-19 test kits, ventilators, and a multitude of active pharmaceutical ingredients. There are also hopes that the electronics sector could remain stable due to the increased need for IT equipment to support the shift to remote working. Business Parks in City Fringe and Warehouses Remain Resilient Business parks in the city fringe are doing well due to their central location. Firms sought out these business park spaces to relocate and lower their real estate costs, or for use as a secondary location to supplement their main office in the CBD. In particular, Mapletree Business City I & II have enjoyed high occupancy rates and the rents for these properties have risen. The warehouse segment is also resilient, as demand for storage space increased significantly due to the government-led stockpiling of essential medical supplies and basic foodstuffs to guard against future supply disruptions. The increased stocking of dry groceries and frozen foods has also led to higher demand for cold store facilities. As such, landlords are starting to raise the asking rents of ramp-up properties in high demand. The growing interest in warehouses has spurred an increase in development activities. For instance. Australian logistics firm LOGOS is partnering with CSC Holdings Limited to develop a site at Tanjong Penjuru Crescent into a six-storey ramp-up warehouse with 46,000 square metres of space at a development cost of $108 million. The logistics facility will be built-to-suit with high specifications for CSC Holdings Limited, which has committed to a long-term lease upon completion of the property.

If the pandemic stabilises in H2 2020, the global economy is projected to grow by 5.4 per cent in 2021 as economic activity normalises amid policy support. However, as the pandemic situation is still evolving, the global growth forecast is still very much uncertain. For the Asean-5 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand), the IMF has revised down the growth rate to minus 2.0 per cent in 2020 (previously -1.3 per cent). In particular, Singapore's economic contraction is projected to be 3.5 per cent in 2020, with a recovery to 3 per cent growth in 2021.

The greater plunge in GDP in Q2 2020 was due to the Circuit Breaker measures that were implemented from 7 April to 1 June 2020 to control the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as subdued external demand amidst a global economic downturn. The construction sector trended downwards by 54.7 per cent y-o-y in Q2 2020 due to a cessation of most construction activities and manpower disruptions. For the full year of 2020, MTI has forecasted that there will be a 4 to 7 per cent contraction in GDP. 2 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Table 2: Inflation, unemployment rate and fixed asset investments Selected indicators Q2 2019 Q3 2019 Q4 2019 Q1 2020 Consumer Price Index (Core inflation) Y-o-y % change 1.3 0.6 0.5 0.2 Consumer Price Index (All items inflation) S.A.

However, fixed-asset investment commitments of some S$12.4bn was recorded in Q1 2020, compared to 2019's S$15.2 billion over the entire year (Table 2). These was largely contributed by the manufacturing, chemicals and electronics clusters in Q1 2020. The Singapore Government is dedicating S$93bn, or nearly 20 per cent of GDP, comprising the Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude Budgets to support Singaporeans in this battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. The first Unity Budget announced on February 18 saw S$6.4bn set aside. On March 26, Deputy Prime Minister Heng added S$48.4bn to the effort in a supplementary Resilience Budget. On April 6, he announced a further S$5.1bn in support measures under the Solidarity Budget. On May 26, a S$33bn Fortitude Budget was announced aimed primarily at helping workers and businesses. Many businesses have been facing difficulties due to the overall weakened global business climate. As such, the government has introduced the Jobs Support Scheme to cover employee wages till August 2020. The foreign worker levy has also been waived in April 2020. This waiver extended to June and July 2020 as well, for businesses that are not allowed to resume operations after the circuit breaker. The government has also introduced rental waivers and property tax rebates to non-residential tenants (summarised in Appendices 1 and 2). However, global weakness, technology disruption and ongoing business uncertainty will likely cause further job losses. The retail sector was one of the hardest-hit sectors, and the rental waivers will go some way in helping retailers' tide through this period. However, besides rents and taxes, retailers will still need to grapple with other costs, such as overheads and advertising costs that are beyond near-term relief. For the residential sector, the deferment of mortgage payments till the end of the year will help homebuyers that are struggling with their finances. Additionally, the extension of the project completion period and extension of the sale of housing units relating to the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) remission will also assist developers who were affected by manpower constraints. 3 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INVESTMENT Market commentary Investment sales With the continual threat of the Covid-19 pandemic, market sentiments have been greatly dampened. As the global economic outlook remains uncertain, investors adopted a wait-and-see approach towards investment decisions. Additionally, transactions in Q2 2020 were generally of lower price quantum as investors were wary about their spending. Hence, investment sales declined for the third consecutive quarter, by a steep 53.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) to S$1.9bn in Q2 2020 (Figure 1). With no significant GLS sites being awarded, there were no public investment sales in Q2 2020, in contrast to the S$1.6bn public investment sales in Q1 2020 (Table 3). In the private investment sales market, three transactions exceeded S$100m in Q2 2020, of which one was above S$500m. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Past 3-year annual average: $31.8bn Past 5-year annual average: $26.7bn Source: Various sources, EDMUND TIE Research Figure 1: Total investment sales (S$bn) Key investment sale type Q1 2020 Q2 2020 Q-o-q change (%) Private 2,399 (60.2%) 1,853 (100%) -22.8 Residential/Residential mixed-use 615 (15.4%) 261 (14.1%) -57.6 Office/Office mixed-use 784 (19.7%) 1,324 (71.5%) 68.9 Industrial/Industrial mixed-use 910 (22.8%) 174 (9.4%) -80.9 Retail/retail mixed-use 22 (0.6%) 43 (2.3%) 95.5 Hospitality/Hospitality mixed-use - - - Shophouses 15 (0.4%) 50 (2.7%) 228.9 Others 53 (1.3%) - - Public (GLS) 1,587 (39.8%) - - Residential/Residential mixed-use 1,363 (34.2%) - - Office/Office mixed-use - - - Industrial/Industrial mixed-use 224 (5.6%) - - Hospitality/Hospitality mixed-use - - - Total 3,986 (100%) 1,853 (100%) -53.5 Table 3: Investment sales summary* (S$m) Source: Various sources, EDMUND TIE Research In comparison, three deals in the private investment sales market exceeded S$100m in Q1 2020, and two of the transactions were above S$500m. The larger deals in Q2 2020 were from the office sector, indicating sustained investor confidence in Singapore's economy and office market in the long term. * Refers to the sale of land, building and multiple units with value above S$10m. 4 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Residential 14.1% Office 0.8% Office Mixed Use 70.7% Industrial 9.4% Retail 2.3% Shophouse 5.0% Residential 49.6% Office 3.4% Office Mixed Use 16.3% Industrial 5.0% Industrial Mixed Use 23.4% Retail 0.6% Shophouse 0.4% Others 1.3% Sector trends and outlook * Office (and office mixed-use) investment sales made up the bulk, or 71.5 per cent, of total investment sales in Q2 2020 (Figure 2), with investment sales increasing by 68.9 per cent q-o-q to S$1.3bn. This was mainly contributed by the sale of 30 and 50 per cent stakes of TripleOne Somerset and AXA Tower respectively, as well as sale of retail and office units at 30 Raffles Place (Table 4). With the sale of the 30 per cent stake in TripleOne Somerset for S$155.1m (S$2,250 psf strata area), the purchaser, Shun Tak Holdings, will own 100 per cent of the building, having previously acquired 70 per cent stake in January 2017 from a consortium led by Perennial Holdings. The purchase came after an asset enhancement initiative of the development in 2019. The largest transaction in Q1 2020 was the sale of 50 per cent stake of AXA Tower for S$840m to Alibaba Group, an anchor tenant of the building, from a Perennial-led consortium which included Singapore Press Holdings, HPRY Holdings and Piermont Holdings. Once the deal is completed, AXA Tower will commence its redevelopment. At 30 Raffles Place, formerly known as Chevron House, Saudi Arabia-based Olayan Group was reported to purchase the retail podium and the three lowest office floors for S$315.0m ($2,596 psf strata area).

Nevertheless, activity in the retail investment market was still lacklustre, as there was only one transaction in the quarter. In Q2 2020, a freehold retail unit at St Martin's Apartment was reportedly sold to D'League Pte Ltd, which holds the Asia distributorship for Richard Mille, and is likely to become another watch showroom for the watch brand. The site is rare, with a large carpark space at the frontage. As the commercial unit constitutes around 42 per cent share value in the development, the purchaser will be pivotal to any en bloc sale of the development. * On the other hand, industrial investment sales declined by 80.9 per cent q-o-q to S$174.3m in Q2 2020. This was largely contributed by two transactions: Luxasia Building (S$66.1m, or S$772 psf land area) and 65 Tech Park Crescent (S$25m, or S$291 psf land area). However, this sum excluded the acquisition of a four-storey warehouse at 11 Sunview Way by Deutsche Bank for an undisclosed sum, which is understood to be within the range of S$75m to S$100m. With the inclusion of this transaction, the decline in industrial sales would have been lesser. Demand for warehouse space remains strong, particularly due to disruption to supply chains during the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in tenants requiring additional space for stockpiling as, well as increased demand for e-commerce. * Residential investment sales were muted due to the lack of awarded GLS sites in Q2 2020 and dampened market sentiments amid the economic uncertainties. Moreover, in contrast to four Good Class Bungalows (GCBs) being transacted in Q1 2020, there were two GCBs sold in Q2 2020, which was 53 Windsor Park Road at S$21.7m (S$1,028 psf land area) during the Circuit Breaker period and 76 Windsor Park Road at $21.3m ($1,063 psf land area). The residential collective sales market remained subdued as well with no collective sales concluded in Q2 2020. However, some activity was observed, as Wing Fong Mansions and Wing Fong Court were put up for tender for the second time in 2020 in June, with the tenders closing in August 2020. Residential investment sales plunged to S$261.3m in Q2 2020 from nearly S$2.0bn in Q1 2020, with the Circuit Breaker period limiting viewing opportunities in Q2. While there was a slight improvement in the business sentiment outlook among local firms for Q3 2020 from the record-low sentiments in Q2 2020, forecasts for the overall business environment remained in contraction territory, according to the Singapore Commercial Credit Bureau's Business Optimism Index in June 2020. Despite some optimism from the gradual reopening of Singapore's economy, uncertainties still remain, given the threat of a second wave of Covid-19 infections, continued global social unrest and trade tensions between US and mainland China. Nevertheless, foreign companies and investors are still seen as confident of Singapore's economy in the long term. In the first four months of 2020, a total of S$13bn in investment commitments was secured, which was higher than the annual average amount from 2013 to 2018, as well as the initial forecast of S$8bn to S$10bn for 2020. This can be attributed to the openness and connectivity of Singapore's economy, absence of export restrictions and its robust network of free trade agreements. With Singapore topping the ranks as the world's most competitive economy, investors remain keen to acquire investment assets for long- term stable returns, with net yields ranging from 3.0 to 6.0 per cent. 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH OFFICE Office demand and occupancy rates * In Q2 2020, office demand softened due to the uncertain business climate and the economic contraction. In particular, travel-based and hospitality-related industries were impacted greatly. * Many employees worked from home and adopted various teleconferencing tools to communicate. Even though the Circuit Breaker measures were lifted in June 2020, the economy did not return to the pre-Covid-19 state. There were three stages to the re-opening of Singapore. Phase 1 comprised the safe re-opening of Singapore from 2 to 18 June 2020 and employees were still encouraged to work from home unless required to operate machinery/software or complete a contract/transaction that is legally required to be done in person. It was announced on 15 June 2020 that working from home should continue to be a default option even as Phase 2 of Singapore's economy began on 19 June 2020. * Besides the government and landlords supporting office tenants by waiving their rents through the various budgets, landlords were also more flexible on tenants' rent-free periods in this climate. Figure 3: Office occupancy rates* and q-o-q percentage point change (in arrows) in Q2 2020 * Based on EDMUND TIE Research estimates, occupancy rates of office developments* islandwide contracted by 0.8 percentage points q-o-q to 92.8 per cent in Q2 2020 (Figure 3). The decline in occupancy rates was largely due to the contraction of demand for office space in the CBD and CBD Fringe subzones with net absorption reporting negative figures of 463,000 sq ft and 12,000 sq ft respectively. 7 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Building Location Tenant Sector Remarks Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 2 Marina Bay (CBD) HSBC Finance and banking Relocation Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3 CapGemini Business Services Here Solutions Technology One Raffles Quay North Tower ByteDance/Tik Tok Technology One George Street Raffles Place (CBD) AJ Capital Finance Relocation City House Shenton Way/ Robinson Road/ Tanjong Pagar (CBD) Verifone Electronic Payments Relocation 79 Anson Road Inchcape Shipping Shipping Centennial Tower CBD Fringe Envysion Wealth Management Pte.

Technology firms are faring well in this business climate as companies push for more teleconferencing tools and digitalisation of work processes. * On the other hand, travel-based and hospitality companies have been hardest-hit from the Covid-19 pandemic due to travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed by many countries. One example is Uber, a multinational ride-hailing company, which will be closing its Asia-Pacific HQ in Frasers Tower in the next 12 months. 8 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Rental rates All the various subzones in the office sector showed q-o-q declines in monthly average rental rates in Q2 2020 (Table 6). Most companies were affected by the preventive measures taken to contain Covid-19 outbreak. Within the CBD, Grade B offices at Shenton Way/Robinson Road/Tanjong Pagar showed the greatest rental contraction of 2.0 per cent q-o-q. Older office developments in this subzone did not hold up so well as tenants relocated to more efficient and better quality buildings. Supply pipeline Total supply pipeline from Q2 2020 to 2024 is estimated to be approximately 4.3m sq ft (or 905,000 sq ft per annum), with most of the supply completing in 2022 (Figure 4). In 2021, pre-committed rates for most buildings in the CBD are healthy. For instance, CapitaSpring currently has a pre-committed rate of around 35 per cent (comprising tenants such as The Work Project and J.P. Morgan). However, the market will have to grapple with the huge supply coming on board in 2022 such as Central Boulevard Towers (NLA: 1.3m sq ft) and Guoco Midtown (NLA: 650,000 sq ft). Outlook The office leasing market in Singapore is facing downward pressure. Companies are currently working hard to shore up their cash flows as business sentiment weakens substantially. As enterprises currently plan Safe Management practices mandated by the Ministry of Manpower, they are still weighing their options on lease renewal and expansion plans in the longer term. In our view, risks are on the downside for take-up and rents for the rest of 2020.

The new normal of work and the role of office space will only get clearer over the next few months as enterprises monitor the impact on public health, productivity, and corporate culture of their workforce between WFH and work-in-office options. 9 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL Market commentary Key indicators According to the PMI reading, the manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth straight month in May 2020 (Table 7). This was also reflected in the sharply weaker NODX performance. The implementation of the Circuit Breaker in Singapore from 7 April to 1 June 2020, together with the disruption of global production and supply chains worsened the already weak industrial market. Private demand, occupancy and supply * Based on JTC's estimates, islandwide net absorption expanded from 1.3m sq ft in Q1 2020 to 1.6m sq ft in Q2 2020. However, net supply reversed from 2.1m sq ft in Q1 2020 to -301,000 sq ft in Q2 2020. * The occupancy for warehouse space increased by 0.8 percentage points q-o-q to 88.3 per cent in Q2 2020 (Figure 5). * This was largely due to the increase in overall e-commerce sales and stockpiling by supermarkets. * Notable leases secured in Q2 2020 included: - Techcross, a ballast water management system manufacturer, which relocated to Tradehub 21 - Smart WFM, a HR workforce management consultancy, which opened its first Singapore office at Mega@Woodlands Key economic indicators Q1 2020 Q2 2020 Key trends NODX 17.6% -4.5% (May 2020) * NODX declined by 4.5 per cent y-o-y in May 2020, from the 9.7 per cent y-o-y growth in April 2020 due to the contraction in the global economy and trade. While the electronics segment grew, the non-electronics sectors contracted mainly due to the petrochemicals cluster. PMI* 45.4 46.8 (May 2020) * The PMI increased by 2.1 points from 45.4 in April 2020 to 46.8 in May 2020. May's PMI reading was attributed to slower contractions in the key indexes of new orders, new exports, factory output and employment. * The electronics sector PMI also remained in the contractionary territory at 46.2 in May 2020. Source: MTI, Enterprise Singapore, SIPMM, EDMUND TIE Research * Reading above 50 indicates an expansion, while below 50 indicates a contraction.

The location of the developments is a key factor in determining the extent of decline of rents. For instance, the average monthly rents for business parks in the Central Region held up, while those in the suburban areas contracted by 0.2 per cent q-o-q in Q2 2020. Supply pipeline * The supply pipeline from Q2 2020 to 2023 is around 27.9 m sq ft (NLA) or an average of 7.4m sq ft per annum, staying below the 3- and 5-year annual average of 8.2m and 12.4m sq ft respectively (Figure 7). * The majority of the supply pipeline will be completed between Q2 and Q4 2020 (41.8 per cent), followed by 2022 with 8.5m sq ft (30.4 per cent). The bulk of the pipeline supply will be single-user factories between Q2 and Q4 2020. Outlook The outlook of the industrial sector is envisaged to remain markedly uncertain in 2020, considering the fluid and unpredictable nature of the pandemic, a possibly steep global economic slowdown and resultant ramifications on Singapore's open manufacturing sector. The high number of Covid-19 infections in many worker dormitories has contributed to disruptions in production and construction capacities, as well as to a certain extent, logistics efficiency and workflow. As companies review their demand needs and expansion plans in the wake of the weakened economic outlook, we expect the impact on the industrial property market to be felt in the next few quarters. Overall rents of factories are likely to post an overall decline for 2020. Rents in the business park and hi-tech sectors could also ease further in the near term owing to the pandemic. Nonetheless, the bright spot for the industrial sector is the warehouse sector, as rising online sales and the increase in groceries sales incentivise retailers to stockpile and expand their warehouse facilities to cater to the surge in demand.

It was reported by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in February 2020 that Singapore lost an average of 18,000 to 20,000 international visitor arrivals daily and this loss is expected to increase further. In April 2020, there were only 748 visitors to Singapore. * As international visitor arrivals fell and residents were forced to stay home except when going out for essential services, retailers faced increasing pressures to sustain their businesses while coping with fixed overhead costs. The Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act was passed to ensure a pass-through of property tax rebate from property owners to tenants. A new Bill on rental rebates, involving landlords and the government, was also dished out to help retailers. This will add cashflow strains on landlords, especially for smaller landlords. * Retail sales index (excluding motor vehicles) fell for the sixth consecutive quarter by 6.2 per cent y-o-y in Q1 2020 (Figure 8). The F&B services index also contracted by 10.5 per cent y-o-y in Q1 2020, after seven consecutive quarters of increases (Figure 9). 12 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH * In April 2020, the worst performing sectors were watches and jewellery and wearing apparel and footwear (Figure 10) as people shopped for essential goods rather than luxury items in view of the sober economic climate. Overall, the total retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) declined by 33.4 per cent y-o-y in April 2020. 77.4% 10.7% -1.3% -33.4% -37.9% -46.2% -53.5% -58.9% -63.3% -64.4% -84.5% -85.3% -87.8% -100%-80% -60% -40% -20% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Supermarkets & Hypermarkets Mini-marts & Convenience Stores Computer & Telecommunications Equipment Total (Excluding Motor Vehicles) Furniture & Household Equipment Cosmetics, Toiletries & Medical Goods Food & Alcohol Others Recreational Goods Optical Goods & Books Department Stores Wearing Apparel & Footwear Watches & Jewellery Total (Excluding Motor Vehicles) -27.7% -45.5% -53.2% -59.8% -66.9% -80% -70% -60% -50% -40% -30% -20% -10% 0% Fast Food Outlets Cafes, Food Courts & Other Eating Places Total Food Caterers Restaurants Total Source: Retail Sales Index at Current Prices (SSIC 2015 Version 2018) from Department of Statistics Singapore Source: Food & Beverage Services Index at Current Prices (SSIC 2015 Version 2018) from Department of Statistics Singapore Figure 10: Retail sales index (Apr 2020), y-o-y change Figure 11: Food and Beverage index (Apr 2020), y-o-y change * The food and beverage index trended downwards by 53.2 per cent y-o-y in April 2020, and restaurants (which were largely relying on takeaway sales) were the hardest hit, contracting by 66.9 per cent y-o-y (Figure 11). 13 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 5,000 2018 Jan 2018 Feb 2018 Mar 2018 Apr 2018 May 2018 Jun 2018 Jul 2018 Aug 2018 Sep 2018 Oct 2018 Nov 2018 Dec 2019 Jan 2019 Feb 2019 Mar 2019 Apr 2019 May 2019 Jun 2019 Jul 2019 Aug 2019 Sep 2019 Oct 2019 Nov 2019 Dec 2020 Jan 2020 Feb 2020 Mar 2020 Apr Retail Sales Value - Estimated (S$ millions) (LHS) Online Retail Sales Proportion (%) (RHS) Source: Department of Statistics Singapore, EDMUND TIE Research Figure 12: Retail sales value (S$ millions) and proportion of online retail sales (%) * As people started to shop online due to the temporary closure of many retail outlets, the online retail sales proportion increased to 17.8 per cent in April 2020 (Figure 12).

Sharp declines in consumer demand and retail sales, as well asthe drop of visitor arrivalsinApril and May 2020 due to the circuit breaker measures and travel bans,led to a new wave of business consolidation and attrition, causing vacancy ratesto spike.Consequently, rents of prime floor space fell on aq-o-q basis across the three sub-markets in 2Q20. Investment activity continued to slow down in 2Q20, as landlords focused on tackling operational challenges and travel restrictions hindered due diligence. Investment interest in retail assets was selective and cautious. Retailer sentiment will remain subdued as tourism demand is not expectedto recover in the short-term and continued safe-distancing measures will reduce operational capacity. Despite relief measures provided by the government and landlords, more retail closures are expected as some retailers succumb to the pressure of cash flow constraints, pushing up vacancy rates in the short-term. Rents are expected to fall amid rising vacancy ratesover the next 12 months.Warehouse Demand was healthy in 2Q20, driven by renewals and short-term leasing requirements to accommodate medical supplies, food and consumer items (for example, from e-retailers), as safety concerns and movement controls fuelled a spike in e-commerce activities and increased stockpiling requirements. Underpinned by the healthy demand, logistics/warehouse rents held steady in 2Q20, after easing in 1Q20.This, in turn,supported capital values, which held firm during the quarter. There was one known warehouse transaction involving the purchase of 11 Sunview Way by DWS for an undisclosed price.The property is entirely occupied by XPO Logistics.

We anticipate production in the sector to rise cautiously as manufacturers prepare for higher demand with the restart of economic activity both locally and across the globe. CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR REMAINED RESILIENT IN A TIME OF COVID-19, PROPPING UP THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET TA N B O O N LE O N G , E XE CUTI VE DI RE CTOR, I N DUSTRI AL , CAPITAL M ARKETS According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry's (MTI) Economic Survey of Singapore, the nation's economy declined by 0.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q1 2020, a smaller contraction when compared to the earlier flash estimate of a 2.2% y-o-y decline. This was a result of the manufacturing sector recording a better than expected performance, with the biomedical manufacturing, precision engineering and transport engineering clusters registering output expansions that outweighed the declines in the electronics, general manufacturing and chemical clusters. The Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) hit a trough in April 2020, but the index witnessed a slower contraction at 46.8 in May, as global demand for biomedical goods and pharmaceutical ingredients increased due to exigencies caused by the COVID-19 crisis. The median rent of multiple-user factory spaces island-wide maintained at S$1.78 psf pm in Q2 2020, unchanged from the previous quarter and from a year ago (Exhibit 1). However, leasing volume declined substantially by 43.5% y-o-y, with the number of tenancies from April to May 2020 falling to 1,253. This represented a total rental volume of S$2.5 million. The circuit breaker in Q2 2020, the reduction in manpower as well as manufacturers putting off any expansion or relocation plans due to existing headwinds contributed to the lack of leasing activities. Similarly, the median prices of multiple-user factory spaces generally recorded slight declines or remained flat in Q2 2020 (Exhibit 2). While prices were generally stable in the second quarter, transaction volume fell from S$168.6 million to S$62.0 million between Q1 2020 and Q2 2020, due to the restriction of activities and a rise of economic uncertainties during the circuit breaker.

Segments involved in the production of essential commodities such as medical and hygiene-related products and the delivery of goods, together with warehouses and logistic spaces, that keep Singapore amply supplied, have mitigated the impact of the crisis in the industrial market. Government Policies With the announcement of Phase One post-circuit breaker on 2 June 2020, the resumption of most manufacturing and production facilities was allowed as these work environments posed lower transmission risks. These included the semiconductor, pharmaceutical, medical technology, precision engineering, and energy and chemical sectors. Market Outlook As Singapore transits into Phase Two of the Re-opening, Knight Frank envisages production in the manufacturing sector to increase cautiously as manufacturers prepare for higher demand with the restart of economic activity both locally and across the globe. Not all segments of the manufacturing sector were affected negatively by the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. As such, the biomedical manufacturing clusters should continue to expand due to the present increased global demand for medical-related equipment and products, thereby offsetting the reduction in industrial output from sub-sectors adversely affected Tan Boon Leong Executive Director Industrial Capital Markets +65 6228 6894 boonleong.tan@sg.knightfrank.com We like questions, if you've got one about our research, or would like some property advice, we would love to hear from you.

Pent-up demand for consumer goods after lockdown periods in many countries might also contribute to some increased activity in other manufacturing clusters. As at Q1 2020, some 54.1 million sq ft gross floor area (GFA) of industrial space is slated to come on stream from Q2 2020 to 2024. Of these, about 41.7% of the upcoming developments are projected to be completed in 2020, with the majority comprising factory space. The road to recovery will not be immediate and industrial space users will be cautious in expanding their physical space requirements until such time when economic improvement is more certain. Therefore, industrial rents and prices in general are expected to be under some pressure and could moderate downwards by about 5% in 2020, given the upcoming supply in 2020, as well as the poor economic outlook both domestically and globally.

The economy shrank 13.2% from the same period last year in Q2/2020, extending the 0.3% decline in Q1/2020. The construction sector and services-producing industries contracted in the second quarter on the back of lower construction output as well as weaker demand in food and retail businesses during the lockdown period when non-essential businesses halted. The manufacturing sector also shrank by 0.7% year-on-year (YoY) in Q2/2020, a reversal from the expansion of 7.9% YoY in the preceding quarter. While output of the biomedical manufacturing, electronics and precision engineering clusters surged in Q2/2020, weak global demand and workplace disruptions during the lockdown period weighed on other sectors. As fi rms struggled with order cancellations due to global virus containment measures, the manufacturing sentiments in April slumped to its lowest since late-2008 during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The supply chain disruptions resulted from the extension of Circuit Breaker (CB) also aff ected the local production capacity and effi ciency. Even though there was some improvement in the overall and electronics Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) for May and June, the PMI reading remained in negative territory for fi ve consecutive months. The slow recovery was attributed to subdued global demand and re- escalation of trade disputes between the major economies. Nonetheless, the surge in non- monetary gold exports and pharmaceutical shipments is proving to be the silver lining this year, expanding non-oil domestic exports (NODX) by 16.1% YoY in June after a dip in May. RENTAL MARKET Compared with the fi rst three months, the slowdown of leasing activity in Q2/2020 better refl ected the impact of COVID-19 on businesses. In conjunction with the ban on in-person property viewings during the CB period, leasing volume1 decreased 18.4% from a year ago to 2,353 transactions in Q2/2020. (Graph 1) While the number of new leases signed for multiple-user factory dropped by 21.9% YoY amid fi rms holding back on major relocation or expansion plans, that for single-user factory went up by 14.5% from the same period last year. The former could be due to the possibility that tenants in multiple-user factory have weaker fi nances than the larger companies occupying single- 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). user premises. The impact of the lockdown may have motivated the weaker companies to throw in the towel and wait for bluer skies. The single-user factory tenants may have used this opportunity to renew their lease at more attractive rents. Although leasing demand for warehouse also weakened by 10.0% YoY, the softness was not homogenous. Some areas like Kallang, still saw reasonable demand from industries that are active in this pandemic environment. New demand there came from those in manufacturing of essential products such as masks, gloves and micro fabric material. The overall industrial vacancy level fell 0.2 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.6% in Q2/2020. This stemmed from improved occupancy in single-user factory and warehouse space due to pre-commitments as well as logistics and storage uses, which mainly concentrated in West and East Planning Region. On the other hand, multiple- user factory vacancy level rose 0.4 of a ppt QoQ to 12.5% on the back of subdued take-up rate at the newly completed Bedok Food City. Notably, some existing tenants have also downsized or vacated their premises in Central Planning Region, pushing up the vacancy level within the area. As the leasing activity slowed with the restrictions and disruptions in place, landlords were generally more fl exible on rents. While rents remained depressed with JTC's rental index falling across the board in Q2/2020, Savills average monthly rent for multiple-user factory2 slipped by -1.0% QoQ to S$1.73 per sq ft and that for warehouse & logistics3 fell 0.7% QoQ to S$1.47 per sq ft. SALES MARKET In the second quarter, there was a higher level of interest from some industrialists, such as frozen food manufacturers, who are looking to acquire suitable assets for their operations in the long run. This is likely to have arisen from the pandemic-led shift to frozen food consumption during the lockdown period, resulting in more stockpiling among manufacturers and suppliers to provide a buff er amid disruptions to the supply chain. Nevertheless, despite the rising buying interest in the market, a majority of them did not convert into actual sales because of a mismatch in price expectations between sellers and buyers. The total sales volume fell for four consecutive quarters to a new record low with only 130 deals in Q2/2020. The strata industrial market saw further slowdown in sales activity, with another decline of over 30% QoQ to 114 transactions.

Based on Savills basket of properties7, the average monthly rent for high-specs industrial space was down by 0.3% QoQ to S$3.48 per sq ft, marking its fi rst decline in the last three years. OUTLOOK The pandemic has led to a major economic slowdown globally, leaving many countries in the deepest recession in decades. The virus outbreak and the attendant containment measures have had a more adverse impact on the global economy than expected, with a global economic contraction projected at -4.9% this year. Along with the deteriorating external economic environment and protracted drag on outward-oriented sectors, Singapore's economic outlook weakened further with MTI narrowing its GDP growth forecast for 2020 to a range between -7.0% and -5.0% YoY. According to a survey from the Economic Development Board, 60% of manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen in the next six months compared to the fi rst quarter due to weaker external demand and supply chain disruptions. Apart from the impact of heightened regional trade tensions aff ecting our trade-reliant economy, the volatile biomedical manufacturing segment, lower oil prices, as well as the protracted supply chain disruption and negative demand shocks are adding further downside risks for the manufacturing sector. More companies are embarking on cost containment and restructuring measures. As such, tenants, especially those in non-ecommerce industries and with large spaces, may consider downsizing or giving up their premises as they consolidate their business while reducing their workforce. Even though there are expected delays in completion for some projects, helping to ease the potential supply glut in the near term, occupancy and rental levels are still likely to come under more pressure, particularly for the factory segment. Meanwhile, some segments have a better potential to recover later this year. The warehouse segment may fi nd some support from a spike in logistics and storage needs, while the business park 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. and high-spec industrial segments are expected to see a gradual pick-up as business sentiment improves. Whether by industry, location, leasing period or by land tenure, the lockdown and disruption in supply chains are reforming the way players react. Locations, such as those in Jurong (the western part of Singapore) have suddenly seen a spike in interest from both buyers and tenants. Many warehouses in the west are almost full. However, tenants are taking on short term, typically six to nine-month, leases. The fl oods in China are also creating supply chain issues and in turn causing cost push pressures on items from agricultural to manufactured goods. The fear of supply chain disruptions arising from natural events is forcing domestic suppliers here to build buff ers. However, because they do not know how long lasting such disruptions are, they prefer to sign short-term leases which come with marginally higher rents. Also, the drive towards the 30 by 30 goal is creating demand for industrial buildings fi t for urban farming (the 30 by 30 vision is to grow enough food in Singapore to meet 30% of its nutritional needs by 2030). Industrial buildings with short land leases have seen slightly greater interest as buyers seek to arbitrage on the lease tenure, for example, by selling their existing premises which have a longer land tenure and downgrading to one with a shorter tenure. Although the overall mood in the manufacturing sector is still dour, there is activity in the industrial and warehousing markets, especially the latter. As a result of the pandemic, and now the fl oods in China, the market has been thoroughly disrupted, breaking traditional relationships. It may take a while before players settle down to a level where one can anticipate their moves with a higher degree of confi dence. This means that the root word amongst renters is \"short-term\".

While most industrialists adopted a wait-and-see approach in anticipation of softer prices, industrial property owners are at present, still not desperate to sell their properties, especially the freehold assets which are classifi ed as a more stable asset class and rare. Owing to their scarcity and the large pool of interested buyers, the average price in Savills' basket of freehold industrial properties4 went up by 1.0% QoQ to S$693 per sq ft in Q2/2020. In the current market, prices of industrial leasehold properties continued to edge downwards. Compared with properties with depleting leases, prices of properties with reasonably long lease balance of at least 30 years saw a smaller decline as buyers are largely end-users who purchase the property for their business operations in a long run. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that the average prices for 60-year leasehold industrial units trended downwards by 1.2% QoQ to S$429 per sq ft in Q2/2020. Meanwhile, sellers of leasehold properties with shorter remaining leases were more willing to adjust their price expectations down by up to 15% below valuation, especially if the properties have a higher quantum value. In line with those sentiments, the average price in Savills' basket of 30-year leasehold industrial properties was down for the third straight quarters, albeit at a slower pace of 2.2% QoQ, to S$308 per sq ft in Q2/2020. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPECS INDUSTRIAL The impact of the pandemic dampened business sentiments and aff ected the demand for business park space, with net take-up contracting for the second quarter. The islandwide vacancy rate for business park space rose by 0.8 of a ppt QoQ to 14.8% in Q2/2020. Despite the tightening of supply in Central Planning Region where Mapletree Business City and Science Park are located, weaker occupier demand around the area raised the vacancy level by 1.0 ppt QoQ to 9.6%. (Graph 3) Regarding rents, JTC's business park rental index fell for the fi rst time since Q4/2018 while Savills business park rents also fell, the fi rst in three years. The average monthly rent in Savills basket of prime business park properties5 edged down by 0.4% QoQ to S$5.81 per sq ft as some landlords lowered their asking rents amid weaker sentiments. The older business parks bore the brunt of the downturn, with the average monthly rent in Savills basket of standard business park properties6 slipping by 0.7% QoQ to S$4.07 per sq ft.
