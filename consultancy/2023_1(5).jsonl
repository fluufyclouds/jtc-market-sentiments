This marks a moderation from the 8.5% registered in 2022. Rental and price growth are both expected to moderate in light of slowing global growth and weakness in exports. * In view of the limited supply of modern industrial facilities, Colliers recommends that occupiers start their search early to secure their ideal space; while landlords may have to be more open to rental negotiations and be more flexible to smaller requirements.

Multiple-user factory rents have been the outperformer amongst the other segments, with rents likely driven by new projects. Demand at multi-user factories stems from biomedical and electronic firms, albeit at a slower pace, with most tenants looking at smaller spaces (<10k sf). 2 All I ndustrial Rental growth was positive across all segments, despite declining occupancy in the single-user factory and business park segments. Multi-user factory rents was the outperformer at 2.3% q-o-q, while Business Park rents experienced marginal growth at 0.3% q-o-q. For 2023, rents for multiple- user factory spaces saw the highest growth amongst all segments at 10.7%, the highest annual growth recorded since 2011. Warehouse On the back of resilient demand, warehouses registered a rental increase of 1.6% q-o-q and saw occupancy further tightening to 91.6% from 91.3% in the previous quarter. Supply continued to be tight this quarter (with more stock withdrawn from the market) and outweighed by demand. Demand from third party logistics and biomedical players remained firm, with prime logistics facilities almost fully occupied. Further, with the disruptions arising from geopolitical tensions, there is a necessity for increased distribution capacity and inventory. Nevertheless, warehouse rental growth is likely to moderate in 2024, given that more tenants will be resistant to the higher rents and more may opt to develop sites themselves, partner with a developer, or take on longer term leases. Business Parks Business Park rents have grown marginally 0.3% q-o-q in Q4 2023, registering a 3.4% growth for 2023 and the fastest annual growth since 2017. The growth in rents could be attributed to higher rents commanded at new projects with healthy take-up such as at the recently completed Elementum. However, vacancies remain elevated, especially in the outlying and older business parks, which could drive rental decline. Further, leasing activity is expected to be restrained by weaker macroeconomic conditions with more renewals than expansions. In addition, the deluge of upcoming supply in the next two years could put further pressure on rents and vacancy.

On the investment front, there is likely to be more sale and leaseback transactions or portfolio sales to free up balance sheets and in the search for higher returns. There are also likely to be more redevelopments and refurbishments of older assets in light of the preference for high quality modern industrial facilities. Industrial performance would be fragmented in 2024, as the higher supply could lead to higher vacancies and stagnating rents. On the other hand, shipping disruptions due to escalating geopolitical issues could bring tailwinds for warehouse space demand. In addition, there has been continuous investment from MNCs into Singapore as a regional logistics and advanced manufacturing hub, helping to support the overall industrial sector. However, with slower global growth under elevated capital costs, Colliers is projecting the overall industrial rent growth for 2024 to moderate to between 3 to 5% and price growth to between 2 to 4%. Rental growth will likely be led by the warehouse segment at 4 to 6%. Business parks and factories are expected to see muted rental growth at 0 to 2% due to the increase in supply and weakening demand.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Singapore Economy To Rebound in 2024 Singapore's economic growth in 2024 is expected to improve to about 2% yoy, higher than 1.2% in 2023. The manufacturing sector, especially the electronics and precision engineering clusters, and trade-related sectors are expected to recover in 2024 alongside the turnaround in global electronics demand. There have been emerging signs of a gradual external recovery; non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rebounded by 1.0% yoy, following year-long declines, while manufacturing output rose for the second consecutive month by 1% yoy in November. Also, manufacturing sentiments continued to improve, as the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up for the third consecutive month by 0.1 point to 50.3 in November. Easing Growth Momentum According to C&W's basket of industrial properties, rental movements were flat for most property types in Q4 2023, except for high-tech properties and suburban business parks. High-tech rents rose 0.8% qoq, supported by leasing demand from high-value manufacturing and tech sectors, while suburban business park rents fell 0.2% qoq due to higher vacancy rates. Given a dearth of supply and resilient demand from new economy sectors, the industrial market rents have largely been on an uptrend in 2023, except for suburban business parks which declined 0.3% yoy, driven by older developments, and factory rents which were stable amid a weak manufacturing performance. Prime logistics outperformed in 2023, with rents rising by 9.7%, driven by sustained demand from third-party logistics (3PL) players amidst very tight supply. Given a sharp rise in prime logistics rents over the last 2 years, some occupiers, such as 3PL or manufacturers, could explore build-to-suit (BTS) opportunities to secure sites for expansion and manage real estate costs. Some may decide to develop the site themselves, or partner with a developer for a BTS development and take on a long-term lease. We anticipate moderate rental growth in 2024, given increasing tenant resistance amidst a still-high interest rate environment. Prime logistics and warehouse are expected to outperform, with full-year rental growth of 4-5%. City-fringe business parks and new suburban business parks are expected to see resilient or moderate rental growth of 2-3%. Led by newer and better-located stock, conventional factory and high-tech factory spaces are anticipated to see mild rental growth of 2-3% in 2024, in line with a surge in factory supply.

Despite the manu- facturing contraction of 4.7% and 3.6% in the previous quarter and the whole of 2023 respectively, the sector ended the year on a positive note with a gain of 3.2% in Q4 2023. The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported that Singapore's total manufacturing output increased by 1.0% y-o-y in November 2023. All clusters except for biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering recorded growth, with the electronics cluster registering the highest expansion of 7.3% and the transport engineering cluster following close behind at 7.2%. Based on the Singstat Q4 2023 Business Expectations Survey, manufacturing business sentiments remained positive for the period October 2023 to March 2024. The overall Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) recorded marginal improvement for the fourth consecutive month since September, at 50.5 in December. The electronics PMI also finally broke the streak of contrac- tions and showed expansion in Novem- ber and December with readings of 50.1 and 50.2 respectively. Taking into account the combination of the above data, the manufacturing sector appears to have turned positive in the last quarter of 2023 with the momentum expected to continue in the year ahead. SLOWER SALES BUT MARGINAL GROWTH IN LEASING ACTIVITIES IN 2023 Total industrial sales in 2023 amounted to S$3.6 billion, a 4.4% decline from the S$3.8 billion in 2022. Sales activity in Q4 2023 was similarly slow as well, registering S$578.0 million with 329 caveats lodged, falling 42.4% q-o-q from S$1.0 billion with 441 caveats lodged in the previous quarter (Exhibit 1). The notable transactions in 2023 included the sale of Jardine C&C Regional HQ and Mercedes-Benz Centre for S$142.0 million and S$131.0 million respectively to M&G Real Estate earlier in the year, in February. There were 12,910 rental transactions in 2023, a growth of 2.7% from 12,568 in 2022. However, islandwide leasing activity slowed by 2.4% in the last quarter of the year, with 3,153 rental transactions compared to 3,230 in the previous quarter (Exhibit 2). Occupancy levels remained stable, supporting the improving unit rents of multiple-user factory spaces with moderate increases of about 2.2% to S$1.90, S$2.32 and S$2.83 psf per month for the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile respectively in Q4 2023. Islandwide unit rents for warehouse facilities showed stable growth in 2023, particularly the 75th percentile rent of S$2.70 psf per month as at Q4 2023, the highest since Q1 2000 as demand for quality logistics space remained strong. Rental transaction volume increased by 0.8% to 1,953 units in 2023.

SINGAPORE CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT STRONG POTENTIAL With the growth in manufacturing output and positive business sentiment that started from the second half of 2023, the volume of fixed asset investment (FAI) received by Singapore also increased. According to EDB, S$7.4 billion was received in Q3 2023, reflecting a very substantial increase of 373.6% q-o-q and 675.8% y-o-y. All clusters received more investment commitments than the previous quarter, with exception of the transport engineering cluster. The chemicals manufactur- ing cluster received the largest amount of investment at S$4.2 billion, the highest since the S$9.4 billion of Q2 2008. With signs of a better demand outlook in 2024, global industrial players are confident to invest in the stable industrial sector of Singapore from which to take advantage of the rebound. As such, several industrial players officially opened and started operations in Singapore, having planned and prepared during the downcycle. For example, the highly anticipated Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre Singapore (HMGICS) located within the Jurong Innovation District (JID) was officially opened in November 2023. Occupying seven storeys and 935,384 sf of space, Hyundai Ioniq 5 EVs are produced here. Leica Microsystems, a medical technology firm, revealed its new S$82.1 million, 221,736 sf manufacturing and research and development facility in Jurong in October 2023. Other than manufacturing players, e-waste and battery recycler KGS opened its first battery recycling plant in Singapore in October, adding to the total of three battery recycling plants islandwide.

And although challenges, such as the attacks on commercial shipping in the Gulf of Aden, persist, a more optimistic outlook for manufacturing in 2024 can be expected. Large international manufacturers such as semi-conductor producers that had invested in new facilities or expansion spaces during the winter of discontent in H2 2022 and 2023, prepare to begin operations in order to catch the wind of global rebound in the year ahead. With the relatively positive outlook at the closure of a quiet 2023, the overall industrial rental and price growth for 2024 is projected to be 3% to 5%. A more optimistic increase of 5% is likely for warehouses as demand remains intact for high quality storage spaces amid tight occupancy levels."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The manufacturing sector expanded by 1.4% YoY in Q4, reversing from the 4.9% contraction in Q3. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Singapore economy grew 2.2% YoY in Q4/2023, surpassing the 1.0% expansion in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2023, the economy expanded by 1.1%, easing from the 3.8% growth in 2022. Manufacturing sentiment improved further in Q4 with the Singapore's purchasing managers' index (PMI) inching up to 50.5 in December from 50.1 in September. On the other hand, Singapore's key exports slipped back into contractionary territory in December, driven by continued weakness in shipments of electronics and slower growth in pharmaceuticals. Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) fell by 1.5% YoY in December, following a short-lived increase in November. RENTAL MARKET The industrial market saw a pick-up in leasing momentum in Q4, with total leasing volume1 rising by 4.1% YoY to 3,070 tenancies. It was attributed to the higher leasing demand for warehouse (+23.9% YoY) and single-user factory (+10.2% YoY) spaces. This brings the total number of tenancies signed in the whole year of 2023 up to 12,499, which is 2.1% higher than the previous year. Notably, this was near the highest record (12,809 tenancies) in 2021. As the fl ight-to-quality trend continues to intensify in Q4, it helped boost the sector's growth in 2023 with improved take-up for new and prime multiple-user factory and warehouse space. This helped to ease the multiple-user factory vacancy to a 10-year low at 9.5% (-0.8 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ). The vacancy rate for warehouse space also fell by 0.3 of a ppt QoQ to 8.4% in Q4. Industrial rents continued to grow on the back of stable demand in Q4. The index of general industrial rents tacked by JTC extended gains in Q4, rising over the last three years to new record high. While rents for single-user factory and warehouse segments saw a slower pace of growth at 0.7% QoQ and 1.6% QoQ respectively, those for multiple-user factory segment grew at a faster rate of 2.3% QoQ. Savills' monthly prime industrial rents for warehouse space remained on a positive trend in Q4, with warehouse and logistics properties2 rents rising 1.7% QoQ to S$1.65 per sq ft (+7.4% YoY). Although Savills' monthly prime 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. industrial rents for multiple-user factories3 remained fi rm at S$2.22 per sq ft in Q4, rents had grown by 10.5% from a year ago. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales volume4 continued to taper in Q4, falling by 8.6% QoQ to 370 transactions. The overall buying sentiments were likely to be aff ected by the heightened headwinds and uncertainty in the manufacturing industry and higher borrowing costs. Even though sales momentum for the warehouse space picked up by 61.5% QoQ, overall sales were dampened by muted demand for multiple- user factory space (-14.1% QoQ). Despite the moderated sales momentum, industrial prices continued to grow, with the JTC price index rising since Q2/2021. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed prices growing across all tenure types in Q4. Prices for freehold and 60-year leasehold industrial properties increased at a faster rate at 0.7% to S$808 per sq ft and 1.1% QoQ to S$504 per sq ft respectively, while that for 30-year leasehold industrial properties inched up 0.2% QoQ to S$323 per sq ft in Q4. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Islandwide vacancy level for business parks hit 21.6% (+2.1 ppts QoQ) in Q4, the highest since 2011. This was mainly attributed to poor take- up rate in the Central Region5, where vacancy level went up by 3.8 ppts QoQ to a fi ve-year high of 11.0% in Q4. While overall vacancy level at Mapletree Business City and Science Park rose by 3.5 ppts QoQ to 13.7%, that at one-north worsened by 4.0 ppts QoQ to 8.5% in Q4. Despite the improved take-up in ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee, the overall vacancy level in the East Planning Region continued to rise on the back of subdued demand in Changi Business Park. The rising vacancy rate has put pressure on landlords to keep their rental expectations realistic to retain existing tenants or attract new clients. With index of business park rents tracked by JTC rising at a moderated pace of 0.3% QoQ, Savills' prime business park6 monthly rents remained fl at at S$5.90 per sq ft in Q4. On the other hand, some landlords of the standard business park properties may have begun lowering their rental expectations to keep their premises occupied. This resulted in a 1.7% QoQ decline in the monthly rents 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 22 January 2024. 5 Where Mapletree Business City, Science Park and one-north are located at. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft.

Flight-to-quality trend remained a top driver of leasing activity in the high-spec industrial market. As demand for such modern high-spec industrial spaces remained strong, their rents outperformed the other industrial segments. According to Savills' high-spec industrial basket8, the average monthly rent increased 1.9% QoQ to S$3.90 per sq ft in Q4. This is likely to be the main driver leading the rental growth for JTC's rental index for multiple-user factory spaces, while traditional factory spaces are expected to experience tampered rental growth. OUTLOOK The global economy will continue to be weighed down by geopolitical uncertainties which could lead to further supply disruptions and commodity price shocks. Although the US Federal Reserve is likely to reduce its benchmark interest rate this year, borrowing costs are expected to remain high as Singapore banks are unlikely to lower their interest rates signifi cantly in 2024 amid the ongoing economic uncertainties and rising 7 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 8 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. to see another surge in demand for warehouse space for stockpiling. Moreover, Singapore's consumer spending growth may stay slow in 2024 as infl ationary pressures are prompting individuals and households to tighten their belts. Others might also prefer to spend overseas as evidenced by the increase in outbound travel. As the capacity for consumption could be limited in the near term, businesses are less likely to need more industrial space for goods. With a slew of new developments (2.4 million sq ft multiple- user factory GFA, 4.2 million sq ft warehouse GFA) in the pipeline this year, industrial rents are anticipated to see moderate growth in 2024 alongside high operating costs and challenging business environment abroad and locally.

With the anticipated recovery in global electronics demand this year, the manufacturing sector is expected to continue expanding. This should lend some support to the demand for industrial space across the high-spec industrial and prime logistics segments. While global supply chains face supply disruptions and higher shipping costs due to the crisis in the Red Sea and the drought conditions in the Panama Canal, it is expected to have limited impact on Singapore as most of the critical supplies are delivered by air freight. Also businesses here are more inclined to hedge against disruptions, and thus stock up to add buff er. However, most of the bulking up had taken place in the past 3 years.

New supply in the region reached 7.3 million square metres (78.6 million square feet) in the first half of the year, up from an average of four million square metres (43.1 million square feet) per year over the past five years, according to JLL research. But there\u2019s one major outlier: Singapore. One of Asia\u2019s biggest ports is short on warehouses that can store everything from the government's post- pandemic stockpile of medicines and food, to the expanding needs of e-commerce companies. A big bet for relief is being placed on a massive high-tech port, but that\u2019s not set to be completed until the 2040s. In the meantime, rents and values are on the rise for the tenth consecutive quarter, JLL data shows. Singapore also has the third-highest logistics rental values in Asia Pacific, and the fourth-highest in logistics capital values, in the first half of 2023. \u201cSingapore is the distribution centre between Asia Pacific and the rest of the world,\u201d says Tan Boon Leong, Executive Director of Logistics & Industrial Leasing, Singapore, JLL. \u201cAt the heart of our logistics shortage is Supply crunch entrenched Land scarcity lies at the heart of the sector's persistent demand-supply gap. From 2023 to 2026, Singapore's West Planning Region\u2019s annual average supply pipeline is expected to fall short of the 10-year annual average The latest news, Insighes anid net absorption by 600,000 square feet, according to JLL data. According to Tan, the supply shortage creates competition that benefits the country\u2019s economy. The government \u2014 through JTC, the government agency in charge of industrial development \u2014 doles out small parcels of land only to investors and end users who meet its stringent criteria, including requirements for sustainability and technology. For example, solar panels have been made mandatory for all new and renewed facilities on JTC land. As each parcel of land is small and market options are few, the competitive nature ensures that only businesses that can support the country\u2019s wider goals will be awarded. \u201cWho qualifies depends on what value they can add to the economy,\u201d says Tan. Tuas Mega Port to fuel further demand A handful of multi-tenanted warehouses coming up for lease in 2025 will provide about 1.6 million square feet of short-term space. Several built-to-suit facilities will also be completed in the same year, adding another 2.3 million square feet of new stock. In the longer term, the bet is on the Tuas Mega Port, a $$20 billion ($14.7 billion) fully-automated container terminal currently under construction, Slated for completion by the 2040s, it will consolidate all port operations that are currently spread across Singapore in one location in the far west of the island. So far, between the end of 2012 \u2014 when plans for the mega port were first announced \u2014 and the first half of 2023, there has been a 74% increase in logistics properties in the area, a JLL report on the Tuas Mega Port reveals. \u201cWe see occupiers such as third-party logistics providers increasingly relocating there even though Tuas is currently no-man\u2019s land,\u201d says Tan. For example, the 2.7 million-square-foot LOGOS Tuas Logistics Hub, completed in 2022, counts Maersk and DB Schenker among notable tenants. Toll Group\u2019s 1.1 million-square-foot Toll City, completed in 2017, stands as a seven-storey intelligent ramp-up warehouse. \u201cOnce sufficient amenities are in place, Tuas will attract supporting industries that may be more labour- intensive, including manufacturing, research, and pharmaceuticals,\u201d says Tan. While the stock increase is expected ease some existing demand, Tan foresees that new interest in the Tuas Mega Port may put more pressure on the persistent supply crunch. \u201cOnce investors see it as a magnet for growth, the increase in supply may not be able to meet the boom in new requirements,\u201d says Tan."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

More than 1,800 companies re-shored their productions last year, according to a report from the non-profit Reshoring Initiative. But this isn't really a story of reshoring, says Richard Thompson, international supply chain director at JLL. More on \"Industrial\" PODCAST: Do warehouses need green certifications? October 25, 2022 PODCAST: The building blocks of a net-zero warehouse October 24, 2022 PODCAST: The long road to a greener last mile October 23, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic, which snarled supply chains worldwide, prompted manufacturers to reconsider their sourcing strategies and make them better suited to shocks. \"This is more a story of risk management,\" Thompson says. \"The pandemic exposed how fragile our global supply chain was when reliant on one region. A more regionalized model allows companies to be nimbler when problems arise.\" This is creating a boom for industrial real estate, which was already one of the hottest commercial property sectors in the last decade. While manufacturing has typically not been one of the most active industries for leasing activity in the U.S., JLL's Industrial Demand study shows that activity during the past two years has picked up across the entire spectrum as companies (mainly automotive) continue to diversify their footprint--a trend researchers expect to continue for years. Demand for regionalization continues A study of transcripts of S&P 500 companies by S&P Global Market Intelligence found a rise in the number of mentions of regionalizing supply chains during the last two years. While talks were at an all-time high in 2020, the research found that conversation activity peaked again at the end of 2022. \"Companies are trying to diversify risk, and one way to do that is to manufacture or source in more than one country or with more than one company,\" Thompson says. \"Another reason is that companies want to limit complexity in transit times and freight costs. The closer your manufacturing or sourcing operations are to the end customer, you gain the benefits of lower freight costs and quicker transit times because you are not moving product as far.\" The impact is reaching markets across the globe. Take India, where Apple recently announced plans to spread manufacturing around multiple countries to reduce the chances of supply chain interruptions. The technology company has already shifted iPhone production to India--thanks to its competitive workforce--with plans to triple its output in the next three years and is moving production of its MacBook from China to Vietnam by May 2023. Your needs Industries Trends & Insights Properties The boom being seen in commercial real estate isn't just surrounding manufacturing leasing and greenfield development. \"The trickle-down effect is also something to watch,\" Thompson says. \"When a company moves manufacturing to a new market, you start to see suppliers spring up to serve that new plant and then distribution facilities. New manufacturing is a big driver of economic activity.\" The next wave While the COVID-19-induced supply chain bottlenecks and port jams forced manufacturers to reevaluate their offshore production capabilities, the need for advancement in manufacturing is furthering demand, according to JLL's Industrial Demand 2022 study. Specifically in the Americas, the report shows that the push for the electrification of automobiles, coupled with the necessity to move the production of semiconductors to America's shores, has spurred activity. According to the report, there are 19.35 million square feet of manufacturing demand on the market. And JLL Research is currently tracking more than 77 million square feet of manufacturing facilities now being built throughout the country. Chandranath Dey, India Head of Operation and Business Development in the Logistics & Industrial team, says companies like Apple moving manufacturing operations to the country have considerably impacted land sales and leasing activity. In addition, the country has seen significant investment from various industries and countries, ranging from metal manufacturers in Luxembourg and Switzerland to Asian automotive and electric vehicle manufacturers. Dey calls manufacturing leasing the \"new animal,\" as the country cannot build ground-up space fast enough to satisfy investor appetite. India has witnessed the highest greenfield in manufacturing investment (16.3 billion between January 2020 and July 2021) intentions among MITI-V countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and Vietnam). Last January through July, Dey says they saw about 18 to 20 million square feet of releasing in the manufacturing domain only, leaving out manufacturing land acquisitions and such. Dey points to a list of government initiatives that have set the country up for success in this burgeoning industry. Some of those initiatives include India now having the lowest corporate taxes in Southeast Asia for manufacturing units and an incentive programming centered around production. President Biden's Build Back Better Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have also been considerable drivers in companies bringing manufacturing operations back to the U.S., says Trevor Ragsdale, U.S. Head of JLL's Industrial Occupier Services. \"These legislations coupled with rising energy costs in Europe, have made the U.S. the priority focus for EV and clean energy investments,\" Ragsdale says.

There is still take-up at multi-user factories from biomedical and tech-related firms, albeit at a slower pace, with most tenants looking at smaller spaces (<10k sf). With a surge of single-user factory space coming on stream, and overall softer demand on the back of a tempered manufacturing outlook, leasing activity and rental growth for both asset types are likely to slow going forward. 2 All Industrial The JTC All Industrial price and rental indices continued their twelfth consecutive quarter of growth during Q3 2023, reaching their highest levels since Q1 2016 and Q2 2014 respectively. This was despite the fact that industrial indicators remained weak, though NODX and manufacturing contracted at slower rates, with the PMI moving out of contractionary territory. Warehouse Given the resilient demand, warehouses registered a rental increase of 2.4% q-o-q and saw occupancy further tightening to 91.3% from 91.0% from the previous quarter. This also means warehouses registered the highest rental growth q-o-q across all segments and was the only segment seeing an increase in occupancy. Supply continued to be tight this quarter (with some stock withdrawn from the market) and outweighed by demand. Further, warehouses represent only 25.7% of upcoming industrial space. Demand from international logistics players remained firm with AP Moller Maersk, DB Schenker and DSV(with Logos) breaking ground on their built-to-suit warehouses, while prime logistics facilities are almost fully occupied. Nevertheless, with a tentative manufacturing recovery under weaker global growth and economic uncertainty, this rental growth is expected to moderate. Business Parks Business Park rents have grown 1.2% q-o-q in Q3 2023, despite occupancy easing by 10 percentage points. In addition to higher upcoming supply, net demand has been negative for the past three quarters. Further, vacancies remain elevated, especially in the outlying business parks. With occupiers spoilt for choice, it is likely to become a tenants' market where rents might have to soften.

As such, landlords may have to give in to lower rents or offer incentives to retain or attract new tenants, especially for the older projects.\" Overall occupancy declined by 0.2% q-o-q, (vs an increase of 0.3% q-o-q in 2Q 2023), as new completions came onto the market. There will continue to be a ramp-up of supply in the next few years; between 2024 to 2026, there is an average annual supply of 1.0 mil sqm coming onstream, exceeding the average annual demand of 0.7 mil sqm per year over the past three years. As such, supply is expected to stay ahead of demand, which could put more pressure on rents and occupancy. Nonetheless, NODX and manufacturing output point to an improvement in September 2023, contracting at slower rates, while PMI improved for the fourth straight month to 50.1 in September, moving out of contractionary territory. Further, the 3Q 2023 Business Expectations Survey showed that the general outlook and output forecast for the manufacturing sector remains positive for the second half of 2023. The warehouse segment is expected to continue being the bright spot of the sector, with strong demand from last-mile logistics and cold storage. In addition, there continues to be investments into new facilities in Singapore, which will help support the overall industrial sector. New builds are expected to lead rental growth as they are more likely to be able to meet the business requirements of high-tech industries such as biomedical and advanced manufacturing. With the improvement in industrial indicators and business sentiments, industrial demand could turn a corner early next year.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Recovery On The Cards? In Q2 2023, Singapore's economy grew by 0.5% yoy, extending from previous quarter's 0.4% yoy growth, bringing H1 2023 growth to 0.4%. Singapore's economy is expected to grow by 0.5%-1.5% amid a weak external demand outlook. The electronics downcycle continues to weigh on Singapore's economy, as both non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and manufacturing output fell for the eleventh consecutive month in August by 20.1% yoy and 12.1% yoy respectively. However, we see signs of recovery by 2024. Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up 0.2 point to 50.1 as it returned to expansionary territory in September. Also, global semiconductor sales seem to be turning around, with July sales up 9.3% (on a 3-month moving average basis) over the last four months since the trough in March 2023, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association. Rents Stabilise Across Most Property Types Except for business park spaces and warehouses, rents across the various industrial property types have largely held constant in Q3 2023. City fringe business parks rents fell by 0.2% qoq while suburban business park rents rose 0.1% qoq, although it was driven by a few projects in our property basket. Warehouse rents rose 2.9% qoq, underpinned by sustained demand from logistics players amidst limited space. On the other hand, despite healthy enquiries, prime logistics recorded no rental movement in the quarter as most are fully leased. Overall vacancies continued to tighten amid limited availability of supply in the market, especially for modern and high specifications properties. On a YTD basis, suburban business parks and conventional factories rents have held steady, while city fringe business parks, science parks and high-tech rents have grown by 0.5%, 0.9% and 1.7% respectively. Warehouse and prime logistics rents have increased by 6.0% and 9.7% respectively YTD. Cautious Optimism Amidst Signs of Manufacturing Recovery Amid an economic slowdown, overall industrial leasing enquiries have quietened down in recent months. However, we are sanguine that leasing activities could pick up towards the end of this year alongside an improving manufacturing economy. Demand will be driven by flight to quality, with sectors such as biomedical, industrial services and general manufacturing still looking to take up spaces, especially at the eastern and western regions. Singapore remains a key regional supply chain hub and warehouse demand by logistics players continues to remain strong. For example, global logistics company DSV and Logos have announced a joint $200 million investment in a built-to-suit warehouse facility to be located in Tukang Innovation Drive in Taman Jurong, with expected completion by mid-2025.

Although the manufacturing sector continued to contract by 5.0% y-o-y in Q3 2023, on a quarterly basis there was a turnaround with a very slight 0.2% growth from the 1.5% q-o-q decline in Q2 2023. The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported that Singapore's total manufacturing output decreased by 12.1% y-o-y in August 2023. The transport engineering cluster was the only one tracking positive growth with 16.2% in August, as tourism recovers to pre-pandemic numbers. However, other manufacturing clusters continued to decrease with the electronics cluster contracting the most, by 20.0%, followed by a 14.4% fall in the precision engineering cluster. The slowdown in the various manufacturing clusters resulted in the continued muted activity in the industrial real estate sector during the quarter. Despite the decreasing total manufacturing output, the Singstat Q3 2023 Business Expectations Survey showed that business sentiment for the manufacturing sector remained positive for the period July to December 2023, suggesting that recovery might be on the horizon. The overall Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) finally registered an expansion in September, recording 50.1, an increase of 0.2 points from 49.9 in August and the fourth consecutive month of marginal improvement. Similarly, the electronics PMI also showed slight improvement even though it continued to be below 50 for 14 straight months since August 2022. Combined with the advanced GDP estimates, the PMI could be an early indication that the manufacturing sector will bottom out and the tide might turn in the next few months. SLOWER SALES AND LEASING ACTIVITY IN THE QUARTER Industrial sales activity in Q3 2023 slowed down, registering a quarterly decline of 16.4% with 381 sales transactions that amounted to S$922.7 million, a fall of 13.9% q-o-q. Notable sales included the sale of Sime Darby Business Centre for S$68.0 million (S$818 psf) in July, and Reebonz Building to the Tan family of Sunray Woodcraft Construction for S$39.0 million (S$453 psf) in August. In contrast to industrial sales, leasing activity was more stable, registering a moderate pick up in average rents for all property types. However, islandwide leasing activity for multiple-user factories decreased 2.4% q-o-q to 2,461 tenancies even though the median rent grew 3.7% q-o-q to S$2.17 psf pm, after chalking up a similar increase in Q2 2023 (Exhibit 2). Despite the shrinking electronics sector, occupancy levels remain stable without noticeable signs of end-users giving up significant volumes of space. Quality warehouse spaces and facilities remained steady in 2023. Warehouse median rents increased for the sixth consecutive quarter touching S$2.00 psf pm in the current quarter, while rental transaction volume was \"Sales and leasing activity in the industrial market has been relatively steady despite the poor manufacturing performance in 2023, setting the stage for when the manufacturing sector turns a corner and begins to pick up.\" NORISHIKIN KHALIK, DIRECTOR, OCCUPIER STRATEGY AND SOLUTIONS knightfrank.com.sg/research Q3 2023 3,230 LEASES Number of Industrial Tenancies 2.1% Q-O-Q | 2.1% Y-O-Y S$922.7 MILLION Total Industrial Sales 13.9% Q-O-Q | 15.6% Y-O-Y 38.9 Upcoming Supply (Q3 2023 to 2027) MILLION SF GFA Singapore Research Industrial & Logistics Exhibit 2: Industrial Leasing Volume and Median Rentals Number of Tenancies Median Rental (S$ psf pm) Source: JTC J-Space, Knight Frank Research Note: The median rent is based on a four-quarter moving average. $4.50 $4.00 $3.50 $3.00 $2.50 $2.00 $1.50 $1.00 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 Multiple-user Factory Single-user Factory Business Park Warehouse Number of Tenancies (Bar), Median Rentals (Line) Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2018 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2019 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2020 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2021 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2022 Q1 Q2 Q3* 2023 fairly consistent with 456 units. The promise of soon-to-be completed stock, combined with inventory being cleared from existing storage spaces have eased some of the demand pressures for quality logistics facilities in Q3 2023. SINGAPORE CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT STRONG POTENTIAL FOR MANUFACTURING CLUSTERS According to EDB, Singapore received a total of S$1.6 billion in fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments in Q2 2023, a decrease of 20.4% q-o-q and 75.2% y-o-y as global manufacturers remained tentative on expansion amid the continuing uncertainty. Nonetheless, several clusters such as the chemical, biomedical manufacturing and transport engineering clusters received more forward-looking investment commitments compared to the previous quarter, as Singapore remained attractive to high-end international industrialists. The first hydrogen-ready co-generation plant in Singapore will be built by Keppel together with a consortium comprising Mitsubishi Power Asia-Pacific and Jurong Engineering. This plant will be located in Jurong Island and is expected to be completed in H1 2026. Global logistics company DSV and logistics real estate specialist Logos will invest $200 million to develop a 720,000 sf built-to-suit warehouse facility that is expected to be completed by mid-2025. GlobalFoundries opened its 247,570 sf expansion of their fabrication plant in Woodlands in September at a cost of S$5.5 billion. Additionally, Hong Leong Asia opened a 409,029 sf construction and prefabrication facility at Punggol in July, the largest of its kind to mitigate the stress on supply chains that were the cause of delays in the aftermath of the pandemic.

MARKET OUTLOOK The industrial real estate sector has been in a holding pattern throughout 2023 and is likely to end the year in similar circumstances. Even though manufacturing output and contribution to GDP contracted during the year, industrial real estate indicators of occupancy levels, prices and rents generally remained stable for most industrial property types, from time to time even recording marginal gains. While not out of the woods yet, there are signs that the outlook by the end of 2023 will be more hopeful for manufacturing than at the start of the year, with early signals that the worst might have passed. Although Singapore's key exports shrank by 13.2% y-o-y in September 2023, this has abated from the 22.5% slide in August. Added to the combination of the turnaround in sentiment from official business surveys, the PMI turning positive, and a slight quarterly gain in manufacturing GDP growth based on Q3 2023 advance estimates, the sector might start to recover in early 2024 with the industrial real estate market strengthening in tandem."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

While recovery in the tourism sector helped to support economic growth, the manufacturing sector faced broad-based weaknesses and therefore a continued drag on the overall economy. Nonetheless, there are some signs of stabilisation as Singapore's overall manufacturing sentiment headed back to positive territory for the fi rst time in six months in September. Even though the electronics sector was still contracting, the Manufacturing PMI edged up to 50.1 in September, signalling that the manufacturing downturn may have bottomed. Singapore's key exports also showed a slower pace of decline, with non-oil domestic exports (NODX) falling by 13.2% YoY in September, moderating from the 22.5% contraction in August. RENTAL MARKET Despite some signs of stabilisation, leasing momentum in the industrial market softened amid a slowdown in the region and Europe. These economic headwinds have weakened tenants' expansion plans, resulting in a decrease in new tenancies signed. The leasing volume1 ended a two-quarter increase with a 2.2% YoY decline to 3,138 tenancies in Q3/2023, with most being tenancy renewals. While leasing activities for multiple-user factory spaces remained relatively stable (+0.4% YoY) in Q3, that for single-user factory spaces slipped by 5.6% YoY. The overall leasing demand was largely dragged down by the warehouse segment which continued to see a decline in tenancies signed (-13.0% YoY) in Q3. Nonetheless, the warehouse vacancy rate fell on the back of tight supply, down 0.3 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 8.7% in Q3. Although there was positive net demand for single- and multiple-user factory segments, their vacancy rates rose marginally to 11.8% (+0.4 of a ppt QoQ) and 10.3% (+0.2 of a ppt QoQ) respectively in Q3 as new factory supply came online. Notwithstanding weak external demand, rents continued to pick up in Q3. The index of general industrial rents tacked by JTC extend gains in Q3, rising for 12 consecutive quarters to new record high. Rents rose across all segments in Q3, with single-user factory and warehouse segments registering a faster pace of rental growth. Savills' monthly prime industrial rents remained on an upward trend in Q3, with multiple-user factories2 and 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. warehouse and logistics properties3 rising by 4.3% QoQ to S$2.22 per sq ft and 0.6% QoQ to S$1.62 per sq ft respectively. The JTC's rental index for All Industrial Property had risen 7.1% YTD with those of multiple-user factories and warehouses going up by 8.2% and 6.8% respectively. SALES MARKET Following a short-lived rebound in Q2, strata industrial sales activity4 decreased 7.1% QoQ to 380 transactions in Q3. Coupled with protracted weakness in the manufacturing sector, lingering high interest rates and muted global growth are likely to have hindered sales activity. Even though sales momentum for the warehouse space picked up again (+13.6% QoQ), overall sales were dragged down by the slower sales for multiple-user factory space (-8.8% QoQ). Although there was a marginal transaction volume, the total transaction value for both segments increased implying that demand was centered on larger premises. Industrial prices also continued to grow, with the JTC price index rising consecutively since Q2/2021.

Despite the improvement in vacancy rates in Mapletree Business City, Science Park and CleanTech Park, the islandwide vacancy level was aff ected by the poor take-up rate in the East Planning Region where the vacancy level went up to 27.0% (+0.7 of a ppt QoQ), the highest since 2009. It was mainly attributed to ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee where vacancy level rose by 1.2 ppt QoQ to 24.8%. Furthermore, the vacancy level in Changi Business Park also increased by 0.5 of a ppt QoQ to record high at 27.4% in Q3.

This resulted in a 0.2% QoQ decline in the monthly rents of Savills' standard business park properties6 to S$4.10 per sq ft. Underpinned by the growth of the high-value manufacturing industries, the demand for high- spec buildings remained strong. Newly revamped developments such as 7002 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 have been drawing interest before completion, securing about 50% occupancy nearing to completion. Nonetheless, rental growth has stalled as economic challenges have made occupiers cautious.

As infl ation had ratchetted up interest rates, the tighter global fi nancial conditions, it could potentially prolong the current slowdown in the manufacturing sector.

High-spec industrial facilities and business parks with good amenities and accessibility are also likely to continue to see potential spillover demand from the current tight CBD offi ce market. As demand for multiple-user factory space is anticipated to be supported by high-value industries, rents are forecasted to see healthy growth of around 10% in 2023. Owing to tight supply for quality warehouse space, warehouse rents are projected to grow around 5% by end- 2023. In 2024, rents for multiple-user factory and warehouse spaces are expected to remain fl at a moderate pace amid the upcoming stream of supply, high operating costs and challenging business conditions both abroad and locally.

In particular, prime logistics properties are limited in supply and almost at full capacity.
