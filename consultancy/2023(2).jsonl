This means an overall growth of 8.9% in 2023, accelerating from the 6.9% registered in 2022 and the highest annual growth recorded since 2012. * The price index rose by 0.6% q-o-q, also a slight slowdown from the 1.4% q-o-q growth in Q3 2023 to come in at 5.1% for 2023. This marks a moderation from the 8.5% registered in 2022. Rental and price growth are both expected to moderate in light of slowing global growth and weakness in exports. * In view of the limited supply of modern industrial facilities, Colliers recommends that occupiers start their search early to secure their ideal space; while landlords may have to be more open to rental negotiations and be more flexible to smaller requirements.

Multiple-user factory rents have been the outperformer amongst the other segments, with rents likely driven by new projects. Demand at multi-user factories stems from biomedical and electronic firms, albeit at a slower pace, with most tenants looking at smaller spaces (<10k sf). 2 All I ndustrial Rental growth was positive across all segments, despite declining occupancy in the single-user factory and business park segments. Multi-user factory rents was the outperformer at 2.3% q-o-q, while Business Park rents experienced marginal growth at 0.3% q-o-q. For 2023, rents for multiple- user factory spaces saw the highest growth amongst all segments at 10.7%, the highest annual growth recorded since 2011. Warehouse On the back of resilient demand, warehouses registered a rental increase of 1.6% q-o-q and saw occupancy further tightening to 91.6% from 91.3% in the previous quarter. Supply continued to be tight this quarter (with more stock withdrawn from the market) and outweighed by demand. Demand from third party logistics and biomedical players remained firm, with prime logistics facilities almost fully occupied. Further, with the disruptions arising from geopolitical tensions, there is a necessity for increased distribution capacity and inventory. Nevertheless, warehouse rental growth is likely to moderate in 2024, given that more tenants will be resistant to the higher rents and more may opt to develop sites themselves, partner with a developer, or take on longer term leases. Business Parks Business Park rents have grown marginally 0.3% q-o-q in Q4 2023, registering a 3.4% growth for 2023 and the fastest annual growth since 2017. The growth in rents could be attributed to higher rents commanded at new projects with healthy take-up such as at the recently completed Elementum. However, vacancies remain elevated, especially in the outlying and older business parks, which could drive rental decline. Further, leasing activity is expected to be restrained by weaker macroeconomic conditions with more renewals than expansions. In addition, the deluge of upcoming supply in the next two years could put further pressure on rents and vacancy.

On the investment front, there is likely to be more sale and leaseback transactions or portfolio sales to free up balance sheets and in the search for higher returns. There are also likely to be more redevelopments and refurbishments of older assets in light of the preference for high quality modern industrial facilities. Industrial performance would be fragmented in 2024, as the higher supply could lead to higher vacancies and stagnating rents. On the other hand, shipping disruptions due to escalating geopolitical issues could bring tailwinds for warehouse space demand. In addition, there has been continuous investment from MNCs into Singapore as a regional logistics and advanced manufacturing hub, helping to support the overall industrial sector. However, with slower global growth under elevated capital costs, Colliers is projecting the overall industrial rent growth for 2024 to moderate to between 3 to 5% and price growth to between 2 to 4%. Rental growth will likely be led by the warehouse segment at 4 to 6%. Business parks and factories are expected to see muted rental growth at 0 to 2% due to the increase in supply and weakening demand.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Singapore Economy To Rebound in 2024 Singapore's economic growth in 2024 is expected to improve to about 2% yoy, higher than 1.2% in 2023. The manufacturing sector, especially the electronics and precision engineering clusters, and trade-related sectors are expected to recover in 2024 alongside the turnaround in global electronics demand. There have been emerging signs of a gradual external recovery; non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rebounded by 1.0% yoy, following year-long declines, while manufacturing output rose for the second consecutive month by 1% yoy in November. Also, manufacturing sentiments continued to improve, as the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up for the third consecutive month by 0.1 point to 50.3 in November. Easing Growth Momentum According to C&W's basket of industrial properties, rental movements were flat for most property types in Q4 2023, except for high-tech properties and suburban business parks. High-tech rents rose 0.8% qoq, supported by leasing demand from high-value manufacturing and tech sectors, while suburban business park rents fell 0.2% qoq due to higher vacancy rates. Given a dearth of supply and resilient demand from new economy sectors, the industrial market rents have largely been on an uptrend in 2023, except for suburban business parks which declined 0.3% yoy, driven by older developments, and factory rents which were stable amid a weak manufacturing performance. Prime logistics outperformed in 2023, with rents rising by 9.7%, driven by sustained demand from third-party logistics (3PL) players amidst very tight supply. Given a sharp rise in prime logistics rents over the last 2 years, some occupiers, such as 3PL or manufacturers, could explore build-to-suit (BTS) opportunities to secure sites for expansion and manage real estate costs. Some may decide to develop the site themselves, or partner with a developer for a BTS development and take on a long-term lease. We anticipate moderate rental growth in 2024, given increasing tenant resistance amidst a still-high interest rate environment. Prime logistics and warehouse are expected to outperform, with full-year rental growth of 4-5%. City-fringe business parks and new suburban business parks are expected to see resilient or moderate rental growth of 2-3%. Led by newer and better-located stock, conventional factory and high-tech factory spaces are anticipated to see mild rental growth of 2-3% in 2024, in line with a surge in factory supply.

Despite the manu- facturing contraction of 4.7% and 3.6% in the previous quarter and the whole of 2023 respectively, the sector ended the year on a positive note with a gain of 3.2% in Q4 2023. The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported that Singapore's total manufacturing output increased by 1.0% y-o-y in November 2023. All clusters except for biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering recorded growth, with the electronics cluster registering the highest expansion of 7.3% and the transport engineering cluster following close behind at 7.2%. Based on the Singstat Q4 2023 Business Expectations Survey, manufacturing business sentiments remained positive for the period October 2023 to March 2024. The overall Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) recorded marginal improvement for the fourth consecutive month since September, at 50.5 in December. The electronics PMI also finally broke the streak of contrac- tions and showed expansion in Novem- ber and December with readings of 50.1 and 50.2 respectively. Taking into account the combination of the above data, the manufacturing sector appears to have turned positive in the last quarter of 2023 with the momentum expected to continue in the year ahead. SLOWER SALES BUT MARGINAL GROWTH IN LEASING ACTIVITIES IN 2023 Total industrial sales in 2023 amounted to S$3.6 billion, a 4.4% decline from the S$3.8 billion in 2022. Sales activity in Q4 2023 was similarly slow as well, registering S$578.0 million with 329 caveats lodged, falling 42.4% q-o-q from S$1.0 billion with 441 caveats lodged in the previous quarter (Exhibit 1). The notable transactions in 2023 included the sale of Jardine C&C Regional HQ and Mercedes-Benz Centre for S$142.0 million and S$131.0 million respectively to M&G Real Estate earlier in the year, in February. There were 12,910 rental transactions in 2023, a growth of 2.7% from 12,568 in 2022. However, islandwide leasing activity slowed by 2.4% in the last quarter of the year, with 3,153 rental transactions compared to 3,230 in the previous quarter (Exhibit 2). Occupancy levels remained stable, supporting the improving unit rents of multiple-user factory spaces with moderate increases of about 2.2% to S$1.90, S$2.32 and S$2.83 psf per month for the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile respectively in Q4 2023. Islandwide unit rents for warehouse facilities showed stable growth in 2023, particularly the 75th percentile rent of S$2.70 psf per month as at Q4 2023, the highest since Q1 2000 as demand for quality logistics space remained strong. Rental transaction volume increased by 0.8% to 1,953 units in 2023.

SINGAPORE CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT STRONG POTENTIAL With the growth in manufacturing output and positive business sentiment that started from the second half of 2023, the volume of fixed asset investment (FAI) received by Singapore also increased. According to EDB, S$7.4 billion was received in Q3 2023, reflecting a very substantial increase of 373.6% q-o-q and 675.8% y-o-y. All clusters received more investment commitments than the previous quarter, with exception of the transport engineering cluster. The chemicals manufactur- ing cluster received the largest amount of investment at S$4.2 billion, the highest since the S$9.4 billion of Q2 2008. With signs of a better demand outlook in 2024, global industrial players are confident to invest in the stable industrial sector of Singapore from which to take advantage of the rebound. As such, several industrial players officially opened and started operations in Singapore, having planned and prepared during the downcycle. For example, the highly anticipated Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre Singapore (HMGICS) located within the Jurong Innovation District (JID) was officially opened in November 2023. Occupying seven storeys and 935,384 sf of space, Hyundai Ioniq 5 EVs are produced here. Leica Microsystems, a medical technology firm, revealed its new S$82.1 million, 221,736 sf manufacturing and research and development facility in Jurong in October 2023. Other than manufacturing players, e-waste and battery recycler KGS opened its first battery recycling plant in Singapore in October, adding to the total of three battery recycling plants islandwide.

And although challenges, such as the attacks on commercial shipping in the Gulf of Aden, persist, a more optimistic outlook for manufacturing in 2024 can be expected. Large international manufacturers such as semi-conductor producers that had invested in new facilities or expansion spaces during the winter of discontent in H2 2022 and 2023, prepare to begin operations in order to catch the wind of global rebound in the year ahead. With the relatively positive outlook at the closure of a quiet 2023, the overall industrial rental and price growth for 2024 is projected to be 3% to 5%. A more optimistic increase of 5% is likely for warehouses as demand remains intact for high quality storage spaces amid tight occupancy levels."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The manufacturing sector expanded by 1.4% YoY in Q4, reversing from the 4.9% contraction in Q3. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Singapore economy grew 2.2% YoY in Q4/2023, surpassing the 1.0% expansion in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2023, the economy expanded by 1.1%, easing from the 3.8% growth in 2022. Manufacturing sentiment improved further in Q4 with the Singapore's purchasing managers' index (PMI) inching up to 50.5 in December from 50.1 in September. On the other hand, Singapore's key exports slipped back into contractionary territory in December, driven by continued weakness in shipments of electronics and slower growth in pharmaceuticals. Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) fell by 1.5% YoY in December, following a short-lived increase in November. RENTAL MARKET The industrial market saw a pick-up in leasing momentum in Q4, with total leasing volume1 rising by 4.1% YoY to 3,070 tenancies. It was attributed to the higher leasing demand for warehouse (+23.9% YoY) and single-user factory (+10.2% YoY) spaces. This brings the total number of tenancies signed in the whole year of 2023 up to 12,499, which is 2.1% higher than the previous year. Notably, this was near the highest record (12,809 tenancies) in 2021. As the fl ight-to-quality trend continues to intensify in Q4, it helped boost the sector's growth in 2023 with improved take-up for new and prime multiple-user factory and warehouse space. This helped to ease the multiple-user factory vacancy to a 10-year low at 9.5% (-0.8 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ). The vacancy rate for warehouse space also fell by 0.3 of a ppt QoQ to 8.4% in Q4. Industrial rents continued to grow on the back of stable demand in Q4. The index of general industrial rents tacked by JTC extended gains in Q4, rising over the last three years to new record high. While rents for single-user factory and warehouse segments saw a slower pace of growth at 0.7% QoQ and 1.6% QoQ respectively, those for multiple-user factory segment grew at a faster rate of 2.3% QoQ. Savills' monthly prime industrial rents for warehouse space remained on a positive trend in Q4, with warehouse and logistics properties2 rents rising 1.7% QoQ to S$1.65 per sq ft (+7.4% YoY). Although Savills' monthly prime 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. industrial rents for multiple-user factories3 remained fi rm at S$2.22 per sq ft in Q4, rents had grown by 10.5% from a year ago. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales volume4 continued to taper in Q4, falling by 8.6% QoQ to 370 transactions. The overall buying sentiments were likely to be aff ected by the heightened headwinds and uncertainty in the manufacturing industry and higher borrowing costs. Even though sales momentum for the warehouse space picked up by 61.5% QoQ, overall sales were dampened by muted demand for multiple- user factory space (-14.1% QoQ). Despite the moderated sales momentum, industrial prices continued to grow, with the JTC price index rising since Q2/2021. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed prices growing across all tenure types in Q4. Prices for freehold and 60-year leasehold industrial properties increased at a faster rate at 0.7% to S$808 per sq ft and 1.1% QoQ to S$504 per sq ft respectively, while that for 30-year leasehold industrial properties inched up 0.2% QoQ to S$323 per sq ft in Q4. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Islandwide vacancy level for business parks hit 21.6% (+2.1 ppts QoQ) in Q4, the highest since 2011. This was mainly attributed to poor take- up rate in the Central Region5, where vacancy level went up by 3.8 ppts QoQ to a fi ve-year high of 11.0% in Q4. While overall vacancy level at Mapletree Business City and Science Park rose by 3.5 ppts QoQ to 13.7%, that at one-north worsened by 4.0 ppts QoQ to 8.5% in Q4. Despite the improved take-up in ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee, the overall vacancy level in the East Planning Region continued to rise on the back of subdued demand in Changi Business Park. The rising vacancy rate has put pressure on landlords to keep their rental expectations realistic to retain existing tenants or attract new clients. With index of business park rents tracked by JTC rising at a moderated pace of 0.3% QoQ, Savills' prime business park6 monthly rents remained fl at at S$5.90 per sq ft in Q4. On the other hand, some landlords of the standard business park properties may have begun lowering their rental expectations to keep their premises occupied. This resulted in a 1.7% QoQ decline in the monthly rents 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 22 January 2024. 5 Where Mapletree Business City, Science Park and one-north are located at. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft.

Flight-to-quality trend remained a top driver of leasing activity in the high-spec industrial market. As demand for such modern high-spec industrial spaces remained strong, their rents outperformed the other industrial segments. According to Savills' high-spec industrial basket8, the average monthly rent increased 1.9% QoQ to S$3.90 per sq ft in Q4. This is likely to be the main driver leading the rental growth for JTC's rental index for multiple-user factory spaces, while traditional factory spaces are expected to experience tampered rental growth. OUTLOOK The global economy will continue to be weighed down by geopolitical uncertainties which could lead to further supply disruptions and commodity price shocks. Although the US Federal Reserve is likely to reduce its benchmark interest rate this year, borrowing costs are expected to remain high as Singapore banks are unlikely to lower their interest rates signifi cantly in 2024 amid the ongoing economic uncertainties and rising 7 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 8 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. to see another surge in demand for warehouse space for stockpiling. Moreover, Singapore's consumer spending growth may stay slow in 2024 as infl ationary pressures are prompting individuals and households to tighten their belts. Others might also prefer to spend overseas as evidenced by the increase in outbound travel. As the capacity for consumption could be limited in the near term, businesses are less likely to need more industrial space for goods. With a slew of new developments (2.4 million sq ft multiple- user factory GFA, 4.2 million sq ft warehouse GFA) in the pipeline this year, industrial rents are anticipated to see moderate growth in 2024 alongside high operating costs and challenging business environment abroad and locally.

With the anticipated recovery in global electronics demand this year, the manufacturing sector is expected to continue expanding. This should lend some support to the demand for industrial space across the high-spec industrial and prime logistics segments. While global supply chains face supply disruptions and higher shipping costs due to the crisis in the Red Sea and the drought conditions in the Panama Canal, it is expected to have limited impact on Singapore as most of the critical supplies are delivered by air freight. Also businesses here are more inclined to hedge against disruptions, and thus stock up to add buff er. However, most of the bulking up had taken place in the past 3 years.

New supply in the region reached 7.3 million square metres (78.6 million square feet) in the first half of the year, up from an average of four million square metres (43.1 million square feet) per year over the past five years, according to JLL research. But there\u2019s one major outlier: Singapore. One of Asia\u2019s biggest ports is short on warehouses that can store everything from the government's post- pandemic stockpile of medicines and food, to the expanding needs of e-commerce companies. A big bet for relief is being placed on a massive high-tech port, but that\u2019s not set to be completed until the 2040s. In the meantime, rents and values are on the rise for the tenth consecutive quarter, JLL data shows. Singapore also has the third-highest logistics rental values in Asia Pacific, and the fourth-highest in logistics capital values, in the first half of 2023. \u201cSingapore is the distribution centre between Asia Pacific and the rest of the world,\u201d says Tan Boon Leong, Executive Director of Logistics & Industrial Leasing, Singapore, JLL. \u201cAt the heart of our logistics shortage is Supply crunch entrenched Land scarcity lies at the heart of the sector's persistent demand-supply gap. From 2023 to 2026, Singapore's West Planning Region\u2019s annual average supply pipeline is expected to fall short of the 10-year annual average The latest news, Insighes anid net absorption by 600,000 square feet, according to JLL data. According to Tan, the supply shortage creates competition that benefits the country\u2019s economy. The government \u2014 through JTC, the government agency in charge of industrial development \u2014 doles out small parcels of land only to investors and end users who meet its stringent criteria, including requirements for sustainability and technology. For example, solar panels have been made mandatory for all new and renewed facilities on JTC land. As each parcel of land is small and market options are few, the competitive nature ensures that only businesses that can support the country\u2019s wider goals will be awarded. \u201cWho qualifies depends on what value they can add to the economy,\u201d says Tan. Tuas Mega Port to fuel further demand A handful of multi-tenanted warehouses coming up for lease in 2025 will provide about 1.6 million square feet of short-term space. Several built-to-suit facilities will also be completed in the same year, adding another 2.3 million square feet of new stock. In the longer term, the bet is on the Tuas Mega Port, a $$20 billion ($14.7 billion) fully-automated container terminal currently under construction, Slated for completion by the 2040s, it will consolidate all port operations that are currently spread across Singapore in one location in the far west of the island. So far, between the end of 2012 \u2014 when plans for the mega port were first announced \u2014 and the first half of 2023, there has been a 74% increase in logistics properties in the area, a JLL report on the Tuas Mega Port reveals. \u201cWe see occupiers such as third-party logistics providers increasingly relocating there even though Tuas is currently no-man\u2019s land,\u201d says Tan. For example, the 2.7 million-square-foot LOGOS Tuas Logistics Hub, completed in 2022, counts Maersk and DB Schenker among notable tenants. Toll Group\u2019s 1.1 million-square-foot Toll City, completed in 2017, stands as a seven-storey intelligent ramp-up warehouse. \u201cOnce sufficient amenities are in place, Tuas will attract supporting industries that may be more labour- intensive, including manufacturing, research, and pharmaceuticals,\u201d says Tan. While the stock increase is expected ease some existing demand, Tan foresees that new interest in the Tuas Mega Port may put more pressure on the persistent supply crunch. \u201cOnce investors see it as a magnet for growth, the increase in supply may not be able to meet the boom in new requirements,\u201d says Tan."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

More than 1,800 companies re-shored their productions last year, according to a report from the non-profit Reshoring Initiative. But this isn't really a story of reshoring, says Richard Thompson, international supply chain director at JLL. More on \"Industrial\" PODCAST: Do warehouses need green certifications? October 25, 2022 PODCAST: The building blocks of a net-zero warehouse October 24, 2022 PODCAST: The long road to a greener last mile October 23, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic, which snarled supply chains worldwide, prompted manufacturers to reconsider their sourcing strategies and make them better suited to shocks. \"This is more a story of risk management,\" Thompson says. \"The pandemic exposed how fragile our global supply chain was when reliant on one region. A more regionalized model allows companies to be nimbler when problems arise.\" This is creating a boom for industrial real estate, which was already one of the hottest commercial property sectors in the last decade. While manufacturing has typically not been one of the most active industries for leasing activity in the U.S., JLL's Industrial Demand study shows that activity during the past two years has picked up across the entire spectrum as companies (mainly automotive) continue to diversify their footprint--a trend researchers expect to continue for years. Demand for regionalization continues A study of transcripts of S&P 500 companies by S&P Global Market Intelligence found a rise in the number of mentions of regionalizing supply chains during the last two years. While talks were at an all-time high in 2020, the research found that conversation activity peaked again at the end of 2022. \"Companies are trying to diversify risk, and one way to do that is to manufacture or source in more than one country or with more than one company,\" Thompson says. \"Another reason is that companies want to limit complexity in transit times and freight costs. The closer your manufacturing or sourcing operations are to the end customer, you gain the benefits of lower freight costs and quicker transit times because you are not moving product as far.\" The impact is reaching markets across the globe. Take India, where Apple recently announced plans to spread manufacturing around multiple countries to reduce the chances of supply chain interruptions. The technology company has already shifted iPhone production to India--thanks to its competitive workforce--with plans to triple its output in the next three years and is moving production of its MacBook from China to Vietnam by May 2023. Your needs Industries Trends & Insights Properties The boom being seen in commercial real estate isn't just surrounding manufacturing leasing and greenfield development. \"The trickle-down effect is also something to watch,\" Thompson says. \"When a company moves manufacturing to a new market, you start to see suppliers spring up to serve that new plant and then distribution facilities. New manufacturing is a big driver of economic activity.\" The next wave While the COVID-19-induced supply chain bottlenecks and port jams forced manufacturers to reevaluate their offshore production capabilities, the need for advancement in manufacturing is furthering demand, according to JLL's Industrial Demand 2022 study. Specifically in the Americas, the report shows that the push for the electrification of automobiles, coupled with the necessity to move the production of semiconductors to America's shores, has spurred activity. According to the report, there are 19.35 million square feet of manufacturing demand on the market. And JLL Research is currently tracking more than 77 million square feet of manufacturing facilities now being built throughout the country. Chandranath Dey, India Head of Operation and Business Development in the Logistics & Industrial team, says companies like Apple moving manufacturing operations to the country have considerably impacted land sales and leasing activity. In addition, the country has seen significant investment from various industries and countries, ranging from metal manufacturers in Luxembourg and Switzerland to Asian automotive and electric vehicle manufacturers. Dey calls manufacturing leasing the \"new animal,\" as the country cannot build ground-up space fast enough to satisfy investor appetite. India has witnessed the highest greenfield in manufacturing investment (16.3 billion between January 2020 and July 2021) intentions among MITI-V countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and Vietnam). Last January through July, Dey says they saw about 18 to 20 million square feet of releasing in the manufacturing domain only, leaving out manufacturing land acquisitions and such. Dey points to a list of government initiatives that have set the country up for success in this burgeoning industry. Some of those initiatives include India now having the lowest corporate taxes in Southeast Asia for manufacturing units and an incentive programming centered around production. President Biden's Build Back Better Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act have also been considerable drivers in companies bringing manufacturing operations back to the U.S., says Trevor Ragsdale, U.S. Head of JLL's Industrial Occupier Services. \"These legislations coupled with rising energy costs in Europe, have made the U.S. the priority focus for EV and clean energy investments,\" Ragsdale says.

There is still take-up at multi-user factories from biomedical and tech-related firms, albeit at a slower pace, with most tenants looking at smaller spaces (<10k sf). With a surge of single-user factory space coming on stream, and overall softer demand on the back of a tempered manufacturing outlook, leasing activity and rental growth for both asset types are likely to slow going forward. 2 All Industrial The JTC All Industrial price and rental indices continued their twelfth consecutive quarter of growth during Q3 2023, reaching their highest levels since Q1 2016 and Q2 2014 respectively. This was despite the fact that industrial indicators remained weak, though NODX and manufacturing contracted at slower rates, with the PMI moving out of contractionary territory. Warehouse Given the resilient demand, warehouses registered a rental increase of 2.4% q-o-q and saw occupancy further tightening to 91.3% from 91.0% from the previous quarter. This also means warehouses registered the highest rental growth q-o-q across all segments and was the only segment seeing an increase in occupancy. Supply continued to be tight this quarter (with some stock withdrawn from the market) and outweighed by demand. Further, warehouses represent only 25.7% of upcoming industrial space. Demand from international logistics players remained firm with AP Moller Maersk, DB Schenker and DSV(with Logos) breaking ground on their built-to-suit warehouses, while prime logistics facilities are almost fully occupied. Nevertheless, with a tentative manufacturing recovery under weaker global growth and economic uncertainty, this rental growth is expected to moderate. Business Parks Business Park rents have grown 1.2% q-o-q in Q3 2023, despite occupancy easing by 10 percentage points. In addition to higher upcoming supply, net demand has been negative for the past three quarters. Further, vacancies remain elevated, especially in the outlying business parks. With occupiers spoilt for choice, it is likely to become a tenants' market where rents might have to soften.

As such, landlords may have to give in to lower rents or offer incentives to retain or attract new tenants, especially for the older projects.\" Overall occupancy declined by 0.2% q-o-q, (vs an increase of 0.3% q-o-q in 2Q 2023), as new completions came onto the market. There will continue to be a ramp-up of supply in the next few years; between 2024 to 2026, there is an average annual supply of 1.0 mil sqm coming onstream, exceeding the average annual demand of 0.7 mil sqm per year over the past three years. As such, supply is expected to stay ahead of demand, which could put more pressure on rents and occupancy. Nonetheless, NODX and manufacturing output point to an improvement in September 2023, contracting at slower rates, while PMI improved for the fourth straight month to 50.1 in September, moving out of contractionary territory. Further, the 3Q 2023 Business Expectations Survey showed that the general outlook and output forecast for the manufacturing sector remains positive for the second half of 2023. The warehouse segment is expected to continue being the bright spot of the sector, with strong demand from last-mile logistics and cold storage. In addition, there continues to be investments into new facilities in Singapore, which will help support the overall industrial sector. New builds are expected to lead rental growth as they are more likely to be able to meet the business requirements of high-tech industries such as biomedical and advanced manufacturing. With the improvement in industrial indicators and business sentiments, industrial demand could turn a corner early next year.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Recovery On The Cards? In Q2 2023, Singapore's economy grew by 0.5% yoy, extending from previous quarter's 0.4% yoy growth, bringing H1 2023 growth to 0.4%. Singapore's economy is expected to grow by 0.5%-1.5% amid a weak external demand outlook. The electronics downcycle continues to weigh on Singapore's economy, as both non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and manufacturing output fell for the eleventh consecutive month in August by 20.1% yoy and 12.1% yoy respectively. However, we see signs of recovery by 2024. Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up 0.2 point to 50.1 as it returned to expansionary territory in September. Also, global semiconductor sales seem to be turning around, with July sales up 9.3% (on a 3-month moving average basis) over the last four months since the trough in March 2023, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association. Rents Stabilise Across Most Property Types Except for business park spaces and warehouses, rents across the various industrial property types have largely held constant in Q3 2023. City fringe business parks rents fell by 0.2% qoq while suburban business park rents rose 0.1% qoq, although it was driven by a few projects in our property basket. Warehouse rents rose 2.9% qoq, underpinned by sustained demand from logistics players amidst limited space. On the other hand, despite healthy enquiries, prime logistics recorded no rental movement in the quarter as most are fully leased. Overall vacancies continued to tighten amid limited availability of supply in the market, especially for modern and high specifications properties. On a YTD basis, suburban business parks and conventional factories rents have held steady, while city fringe business parks, science parks and high-tech rents have grown by 0.5%, 0.9% and 1.7% respectively. Warehouse and prime logistics rents have increased by 6.0% and 9.7% respectively YTD. Cautious Optimism Amidst Signs of Manufacturing Recovery Amid an economic slowdown, overall industrial leasing enquiries have quietened down in recent months. However, we are sanguine that leasing activities could pick up towards the end of this year alongside an improving manufacturing economy. Demand will be driven by flight to quality, with sectors such as biomedical, industrial services and general manufacturing still looking to take up spaces, especially at the eastern and western regions. Singapore remains a key regional supply chain hub and warehouse demand by logistics players continues to remain strong. For example, global logistics company DSV and Logos have announced a joint $200 million investment in a built-to-suit warehouse facility to be located in Tukang Innovation Drive in Taman Jurong, with expected completion by mid-2025.

Although the manufacturing sector continued to contract by 5.0% y-o-y in Q3 2023, on a quarterly basis there was a turnaround with a very slight 0.2% growth from the 1.5% q-o-q decline in Q2 2023. The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported that Singapore's total manufacturing output decreased by 12.1% y-o-y in August 2023. The transport engineering cluster was the only one tracking positive growth with 16.2% in August, as tourism recovers to pre-pandemic numbers. However, other manufacturing clusters continued to decrease with the electronics cluster contracting the most, by 20.0%, followed by a 14.4% fall in the precision engineering cluster. The slowdown in the various manufacturing clusters resulted in the continued muted activity in the industrial real estate sector during the quarter. Despite the decreasing total manufacturing output, the Singstat Q3 2023 Business Expectations Survey showed that business sentiment for the manufacturing sector remained positive for the period July to December 2023, suggesting that recovery might be on the horizon. The overall Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) finally registered an expansion in September, recording 50.1, an increase of 0.2 points from 49.9 in August and the fourth consecutive month of marginal improvement. Similarly, the electronics PMI also showed slight improvement even though it continued to be below 50 for 14 straight months since August 2022. Combined with the advanced GDP estimates, the PMI could be an early indication that the manufacturing sector will bottom out and the tide might turn in the next few months. SLOWER SALES AND LEASING ACTIVITY IN THE QUARTER Industrial sales activity in Q3 2023 slowed down, registering a quarterly decline of 16.4% with 381 sales transactions that amounted to S$922.7 million, a fall of 13.9% q-o-q. Notable sales included the sale of Sime Darby Business Centre for S$68.0 million (S$818 psf) in July, and Reebonz Building to the Tan family of Sunray Woodcraft Construction for S$39.0 million (S$453 psf) in August. In contrast to industrial sales, leasing activity was more stable, registering a moderate pick up in average rents for all property types. However, islandwide leasing activity for multiple-user factories decreased 2.4% q-o-q to 2,461 tenancies even though the median rent grew 3.7% q-o-q to S$2.17 psf pm, after chalking up a similar increase in Q2 2023 (Exhibit 2). Despite the shrinking electronics sector, occupancy levels remain stable without noticeable signs of end-users giving up significant volumes of space. Quality warehouse spaces and facilities remained steady in 2023. Warehouse median rents increased for the sixth consecutive quarter touching S$2.00 psf pm in the current quarter, while rental transaction volume was \"Sales and leasing activity in the industrial market has been relatively steady despite the poor manufacturing performance in 2023, setting the stage for when the manufacturing sector turns a corner and begins to pick up.\" NORISHIKIN KHALIK, DIRECTOR, OCCUPIER STRATEGY AND SOLUTIONS knightfrank.com.sg/research Q3 2023 3,230 LEASES Number of Industrial Tenancies 2.1% Q-O-Q | 2.1% Y-O-Y S$922.7 MILLION Total Industrial Sales 13.9% Q-O-Q | 15.6% Y-O-Y 38.9 Upcoming Supply (Q3 2023 to 2027) MILLION SF GFA Singapore Research Industrial & Logistics Exhibit 2: Industrial Leasing Volume and Median Rentals Number of Tenancies Median Rental (S$ psf pm) Source: JTC J-Space, Knight Frank Research Note: The median rent is based on a four-quarter moving average. $4.50 $4.00 $3.50 $3.00 $2.50 $2.00 $1.50 $1.00 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 Multiple-user Factory Single-user Factory Business Park Warehouse Number of Tenancies (Bar), Median Rentals (Line) Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2018 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2019 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2020 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2021 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2022 Q1 Q2 Q3* 2023 fairly consistent with 456 units. The promise of soon-to-be completed stock, combined with inventory being cleared from existing storage spaces have eased some of the demand pressures for quality logistics facilities in Q3 2023. SINGAPORE CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT STRONG POTENTIAL FOR MANUFACTURING CLUSTERS According to EDB, Singapore received a total of S$1.6 billion in fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments in Q2 2023, a decrease of 20.4% q-o-q and 75.2% y-o-y as global manufacturers remained tentative on expansion amid the continuing uncertainty. Nonetheless, several clusters such as the chemical, biomedical manufacturing and transport engineering clusters received more forward-looking investment commitments compared to the previous quarter, as Singapore remained attractive to high-end international industrialists. The first hydrogen-ready co-generation plant in Singapore will be built by Keppel together with a consortium comprising Mitsubishi Power Asia-Pacific and Jurong Engineering. This plant will be located in Jurong Island and is expected to be completed in H1 2026. Global logistics company DSV and logistics real estate specialist Logos will invest $200 million to develop a 720,000 sf built-to-suit warehouse facility that is expected to be completed by mid-2025. GlobalFoundries opened its 247,570 sf expansion of their fabrication plant in Woodlands in September at a cost of S$5.5 billion. Additionally, Hong Leong Asia opened a 409,029 sf construction and prefabrication facility at Punggol in July, the largest of its kind to mitigate the stress on supply chains that were the cause of delays in the aftermath of the pandemic.

MARKET OUTLOOK The industrial real estate sector has been in a holding pattern throughout 2023 and is likely to end the year in similar circumstances. Even though manufacturing output and contribution to GDP contracted during the year, industrial real estate indicators of occupancy levels, prices and rents generally remained stable for most industrial property types, from time to time even recording marginal gains. While not out of the woods yet, there are signs that the outlook by the end of 2023 will be more hopeful for manufacturing than at the start of the year, with early signals that the worst might have passed. Although Singapore's key exports shrank by 13.2% y-o-y in September 2023, this has abated from the 22.5% slide in August. Added to the combination of the turnaround in sentiment from official business surveys, the PMI turning positive, and a slight quarterly gain in manufacturing GDP growth based on Q3 2023 advance estimates, the sector might start to recover in early 2024 with the industrial real estate market strengthening in tandem."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

While recovery in the tourism sector helped to support economic growth, the manufacturing sector faced broad-based weaknesses and therefore a continued drag on the overall economy. Nonetheless, there are some signs of stabilisation as Singapore's overall manufacturing sentiment headed back to positive territory for the fi rst time in six months in September. Even though the electronics sector was still contracting, the Manufacturing PMI edged up to 50.1 in September, signalling that the manufacturing downturn may have bottomed. Singapore's key exports also showed a slower pace of decline, with non-oil domestic exports (NODX) falling by 13.2% YoY in September, moderating from the 22.5% contraction in August. RENTAL MARKET Despite some signs of stabilisation, leasing momentum in the industrial market softened amid a slowdown in the region and Europe. These economic headwinds have weakened tenants' expansion plans, resulting in a decrease in new tenancies signed. The leasing volume1 ended a two-quarter increase with a 2.2% YoY decline to 3,138 tenancies in Q3/2023, with most being tenancy renewals. While leasing activities for multiple-user factory spaces remained relatively stable (+0.4% YoY) in Q3, that for single-user factory spaces slipped by 5.6% YoY. The overall leasing demand was largely dragged down by the warehouse segment which continued to see a decline in tenancies signed (-13.0% YoY) in Q3. Nonetheless, the warehouse vacancy rate fell on the back of tight supply, down 0.3 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 8.7% in Q3. Although there was positive net demand for single- and multiple-user factory segments, their vacancy rates rose marginally to 11.8% (+0.4 of a ppt QoQ) and 10.3% (+0.2 of a ppt QoQ) respectively in Q3 as new factory supply came online. Notwithstanding weak external demand, rents continued to pick up in Q3. The index of general industrial rents tacked by JTC extend gains in Q3, rising for 12 consecutive quarters to new record high. Rents rose across all segments in Q3, with single-user factory and warehouse segments registering a faster pace of rental growth. Savills' monthly prime industrial rents remained on an upward trend in Q3, with multiple-user factories2 and 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. warehouse and logistics properties3 rising by 4.3% QoQ to S$2.22 per sq ft and 0.6% QoQ to S$1.62 per sq ft respectively. The JTC's rental index for All Industrial Property had risen 7.1% YTD with those of multiple-user factories and warehouses going up by 8.2% and 6.8% respectively. SALES MARKET Following a short-lived rebound in Q2, strata industrial sales activity4 decreased 7.1% QoQ to 380 transactions in Q3. Coupled with protracted weakness in the manufacturing sector, lingering high interest rates and muted global growth are likely to have hindered sales activity. Even though sales momentum for the warehouse space picked up again (+13.6% QoQ), overall sales were dragged down by the slower sales for multiple-user factory space (-8.8% QoQ). Although there was a marginal transaction volume, the total transaction value for both segments increased implying that demand was centered on larger premises. Industrial prices also continued to grow, with the JTC price index rising consecutively since Q2/2021. The Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices grew across all tenure types in Q3, albeit at a moderated pace as buyers turned cautious. Prices for 30- and 60-year leasehold industrial properties increased 0.9% to S$323 per sq ft and 0.6% QoQ to S$499 per sq ft respectively, while that for freehold industrial properties went up 0.8% QoQ to S$803 per sq ft in Q3. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Islandwide vacancy level for business parks remained high at 19.5% in Q3, an inch up from the 19.4% in Q2. Despite the improvement in vacancy rates in Mapletree Business City, Science Park and CleanTech Park, the islandwide vacancy level was aff ected by the poor take-up rate in the East Planning Region where the vacancy level went up to 27.0% (+0.7 of a ppt QoQ), the highest since 2009. It was mainly attributed to ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee where vacancy level rose by 1.2 ppt QoQ to 24.8%. Furthermore, the vacancy level in Changi Business Park also increased by 0.5 of a ppt QoQ to record high at 27.4% in Q3.

High-spec industrial facilities and business parks with good amenities and accessibility are also likely to continue to see potential spillover demand from the current tight CBD offi ce market. As demand for multiple-user factory space is anticipated to be supported by high-value industries, rents are forecasted to see healthy growth of around 10% in 2023. Owing to tight supply for quality warehouse space, warehouse rents are projected to grow around 5% by end- 2023.

In a press release on Sept 18, Savills Singapore says that the increase was due to more tenancies signed for multiple-user factory spaces, which went up 10.6% y-0-y and is the highest since 2021. However, leasing transactions for single-use factory and warehouse segments fell by 5.7% and 13% y-o-y, respectively.

The report expects further growth in prices and rents for the rest of the year in most industrial property types despite escalating headwinds and subdued growth in the manufacturing sector, Demand for multiple-user factories is likely driven by new growth areas, such as high-value manufacturing industries, while rents are forecasted to increase by 4% to 6%. Rents for warehouses are also expected to grow by 3% to 5% due to the strong demand for modern and high-specification logistics spaces and the limited supply of quality warehouses. Alan Cheong, Savills Singapore's executive director for research and consultancy, notes that both rents and prices for industrial and warehouses should continue to rise for the rest of the year. \"One factor keeping these two afloat is inflation.

These facilities are also able to cater to tenants with smaller space requirements. Nonetheless, the healthy supply for factories may outpace new demand, with 61% of upcoming supply during H2 2023 consisting of single-user factories. With continued uncertainty and higher costs, occupiers may become more cautious in their expansion plans, thereby impacting demand. 2 All Industrial The JTC All Industrial price and rental indices continued their eleventh consecutive quarter of growth during Q2 2023, reaching their highest levels since Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 respectively. This was despite the fact that trade indicators remain soft, with continuous contractions recorded in manufacturing output, NODX and PMI. Warehouse Warehouses registered a rental increase of 1.4% QOQ, down from the 2.8% growth during the previous quarter as more supply came on stream. Colliers has observed that demand for newer and high- specification warehouses remained strong; while older warehouses were also sought after by occupiers with less demanding requirements. With warehouses making up only 22% of the future supply for H2 2023, overall warehouse rental growth may moderate further in the coming quarters as a weaker economy translates to less stockpiling, and as occupiers focus more on operational efficiency than expansion. Business Parks Business Park rents have risen by 1.3%, accelerating from last quarter's 0.6% increase, supported by flight to quality moves and driven by assets in the One-North precinct. However, despite tight vacancies at the city fringe assets, island-wide occupancies continued to decline as supply outpaced demand, falling by 0.7 pp. Rental growth and occupancies may ease as more supply comes on stream, coupled with slowing enquiries and economic growth.

With a remaining supply of 6.7 mil sf during 2023, and an average of 10.5 mil sf from present till 2025, higher supply will continue to moderate rental and price growth; compared with the average net absorption of 7.7 mil sf from 2021 till present. Supply is expected to stay ahead of demand, which could also provide more options for occupiers. Industrial indicators such as manufacturing output and NODX have exhibited their eighth consecutive month of contraction during Q2 2023, and PMI its fourth consecutive month of contraction, largely driven by an extended slowdown in the semiconductor cycle, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainties and prolonged elevation of interest rates. As such, the external environment is set to remain a key source of weakness for some time with further export softness ahead. All these factors may serve to slow both rental and price growth during the coming quarters. Nevertheless, demand for higher specification industrial assets will continue to support the industrial market, underpinned by demand from industries such as advanced manufacturing, logistics, biomedical, and food sectors; with several corporations expanding their facilities or looking to establish a presence in Singapore, which will help to prop up industrial demand.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Weaker Manufacturing Outlook Singapore's economy grew by 0.4% yoy in Q1 2023, slowing from previous quarter's 2.1% growth. In May, non-oil domestic exports (NODX) recorded a decline of 14.7% yoy, for the eighth consecutive month, while manufacturing output shrank by 10.8% yoy, raising the risks of a technical recession. However, overall factory activity improved slightly; the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up 0.2 point to 49.7 while the electronics PMI declined by 0.1 point to 49.0 in June. This suggests that while Singapore's manufacturing economy remains under pressure due to weak external demand, the outlook could be starting to stablise. A multi-speed Market As industrial demand weakens, rental growth has started to diverge in Q2 2023, with varying performance across industrial segments. Property types with limited new supply are still seeing positive rental growth. Prime logistics rents grew 2.2% qoq, easing from previous quarter's 7.5% qoq growth, as vacancy rates remain tight. Factory and warehouse rents held constant in the quarter, while rents of business parks in outlying areas declined slightly by 0.5% qoq. Older outlying business park developments are facing stronger pressure due to hybrid work and an influx of new supply. Meanwhile, high-tech properties and city fringe business parks rents rose by 0.3% qoq and 0.4% qoq respectively, supported by resilient demand from tech and life science occupiers. Science Park rents growth grew 0.7% qoq compared to 0.2% qoq growth in Q1 2023, though this was driven by higher rents at two developments. More Investment Sales Opportunities There could be more opportunities for industrial investment sales in the horizon. Given rising flight to quality and sustainability demand coupled with limited new industrial supply, there will be increasing interest for asset enhancements or redevelopments of ageing industrial assets. It may be timely for owner-occupiers to consider sale-and-leaseback arrangement or joint development. Also, given the current high interest rate environment, there could potentially be more industrial opportunities on the market as REITs look to lower their gearing ratio. This could be an opportune time for prospective industrial investors, as availability of institutional grade industrial assets are limited.

Although Singapore narrowly avoided a technical recession, the overall economic growth was dragged down by a downturn in the manufacturing sector. While the other sectors posted an expansion in Q2, manufacturing shrank 7.3% YoY, extending the 5.4% contraction registered in Q1. This was attributed to output contractions across all manufacturing sectors, except for transport engineering. In the face of higher interest rates and strong infl ationary pressures, Singapore's manufacturing sector faces weaker demand from major trading partners like China. The city-state's exports have shown no signs of picking up yet, with Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) contracting for the ninth consecutive month in June. Manufacturing PMI has also weakened for three straight months in July, and electronics PMI remains subdued. RENTAL MARKET The leasing activity in the industrial market remained active, with leasing volume1 rising 6.1% YoY to 3,298 tenancies in Q2/2023. The increase was due to more tenancies signed for multiple-user factory spaces, which rose 10.6% YoY to its highest in the last two years. Meanwhile, leasing transactions for single-user factory and warehouse segments fell by 5.7% and 13.6% YoY respectively. Although leasing activity for the two segments had been down, the rents recorded in Q2 were higher than a year ago. Apart from rental increases, the higher total rental value could be due to a rebound in demand for larger facilities. The vacancy rate for multiple-user factory fell 1.0 percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.1% in Q2, reversing three consecutive quarters of increase. This rate is the lowest since Q4/2021. While vacancy rate for single-user factory remained relatively fl at at 11.4% in Q2 (11.3% in Q1), that for warehouse eased 0.7 of a ppt QoQ to 9.0% in Q2. The improvement was largely attributed to healthy take-up in the West and North Planning Region. JTC's overall industrial rents continued to increase further for eleven consecutive quarters in Q2/2023, reaching its highest record in the last eight years. Rents rose across the board in Q2, albeit at a slower pace for single-user factory and warehouse spaces. Nonetheless, prime rents remained strong, with Savills' average monthly rents for prime 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). multiple-user factories2 rising by 5.3% QoQ to S$2.13 per sq ft in Q2. Alongside rising infl ation and strong demand for logistics and food spaces, the average monthly rents for prime warehouse and logistics properties3 in the Savills' basket increased by 4.5% QoQ to S$1.61 per sq ft in Q2. SALES MARKET Following three consecutive quarters of decline, strata industrial sales activity4 increased 8.4% QoQ to 424 transactions in Q2. Although there are factors such as high interest rates and a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, sales activity started to show recovery across all segments of the industrial property type. While multiple- user factory saw the slowest recovery (4.6% QoQ), single-user factory and warehouse recorded an uptick of 44.0% and 28.6% QoQ in their respective sales volume. Despite the increase in sales volume, the total transaction value for single- and multiple- user factory segments fell in Q2. This could imply that buyers are more attracted to more palatable size and quantum, given uncertain future business conditions, and higher borrowing costs. Industrial prices also continued growing, with the JTC price index rising consecutively since Q2/2021. The Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that in Q2/2023, prices for 30- and 60-year leasehold industrial properties increased by 1.4% and 2.4% QoQ to S$320 per sq ft and S$495 per sq ft respectively. Owing to higher fi nancing costs, some demand could have shifted to properties with shorter leases and more aff ordable quantum. The quantum play could lead to faster price escalation for the leasehold properties in future. On the other hand, the rate of price growth for freehold properties continued to moderate in Q2. Compared with 1.6% QoQ in Q1, prices for freehold properties rose 1.1% QoQ to S$797 per sq ft. BUSINESS PARKS AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Islandwide vacancy level for business parks worsened again for the third quarter, rising by 0.7 of a ppt QoQ to 19.4%, the highest since 2014. Although areas such as one-north recorded healthy take-up, the vacancy rate in the Central Region eased by 0.4 of a ppt QoQ to 7.3% in Q2. However, CleanTech Park and ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee saw lower occupier demand with more premises being vacated, 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 8 August 2023.

Nonetheless, some landlords could have lowered their rental expectations to keep their premises occupied. This might have led to a 1.0% QoQ decline in Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents to S$5.89 per sq ft in Q2. On the other hand, some landlords of the standard business park properties with better accessibility and amenities might have better negotiating power to raise their rents after experiencing quarters of rental decline. As a result, the monthly rents of Savills' standard business park properties6 recorded an uptick of 3.2% QoQ to S$4.11 per sq ft in Q2, a reversal of a two-quarter decline. Owing to the prime-quality specifi cations of high-spec buildings, the occupier demand for such spaces remained strong, hence resulting in further rental growth in Q2. According to Savills' high- spec industrial basket7, the average monthly rent increased 2.3% QoQ in Q2 to S$3.83 per sq ft. OUTLOOK As outlook for the global economic growth remains lacklustre, local manufacturers are bracing for continuing challenges in 2H/2023. Although infl ation is showing signs of easing, they are still elevated and could restart rising. Also, margins are being squeezed as competition heats up when business conditions become tougher. Singapore manufacturers grapple with weak demand from the major economies, especially when large markets like China are experiencing a slower- than-expected reopening. We believe that this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. leases may see prices being forced up by a cascade of downgraders. Ultimately, when push comes to shove, an entrepreneur will need to raise cash or reduce his burn and the shorter term industrial properties will provide that avenue for him/her to raise liquidity. For business parks, looking beyond the current tech winter, there should be sustainable interest in the medium term. This comes from the tight supply in business park space where we have new supply collapsing from 3.3 million sq ft GFA in 2024 to 818,000 sq ft GFA in 2025. Thereafter, the JTC statistics show no supply. For high-spec industrial space, demand has been strong, underpinned by the rise of high-value manufacturing industries such as advanced manufacturing, technology and biomedical science fi rms. High-spec industrial spaces with modern facilities and excellent accessibility are expected to see healthy demand amid tight supply. With that, overall rents for prime business park and high-spec industrial space are forecast to continue to trend up this year. We believe that both rents and prices for industrial and warehouses should continue to rise in 2023. One factor keeping these two afl oat is infl ation. The other is higher interest rates. Also, as most landlords are fi nancially strong, it puts them in a better position to pass their higher interest expenses on to tenants.

The latter is a move by manufacturers to build other plants outside China to hedge against future supply chain disruption. Thus, not only do we have a global-ex-US economic slowdown, but South-East Asia (with the exception of Vietnam) also faces a dilution of demand/supply of goods and services coming from China due to the re-routing of supply chains. Despite escalating headwinds and subdued growth in the manufacturing sector, most industrial property types are expected to see further growth, with prices and rents remaining on an upward trend for the rest of the year. While demand for multiple-user factories is likely to be driven by new growth areas such as high-value manufacturing, rents are forecast to increase by 4% to 6% in 2023. Owing to limited supply for quality warehouse space, rents for warehouses are also expected to grow by 3% to 5% in view of the strong demand for modern and high-specifi cation logistics spaces. The challenges facing manufacturers, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), will motivate those who have excess industrial space or are holding onto assets with longer term leases to either sub-let or arbitrage the lease by downgrading to those with a shorter lease term.

SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - In 1Q2023, the overall occupancy rate for the industrial property market fell to 88.8%, according to the latest quarterly market report by JTC. This is a fall of 0.6 percentage points compared to the previous quarter and a decline of 1.0 percentage points compared to the same period a year ago. The fall in overall occupancy is due to new project completions in 1Q2023 as new industrial supply continues to exceed demand, says JTC. The statutory board says that around 10.76 million sq ft of new industrial space is expected to be completed for the whole of 2023. Of the upcoming supply, single-user factory space makes up about 62%, warehouse space makes up 21%, while the remaining 17% comprises multiple-user factory and business park space. Q As a result, the end of 1Q2023 saw total available industrial real estate stock increased to around 3.84 million sq ft, while total occupied stock increased by 53,820 sq ft in 1Q2023 compared to the previous quarter. FE Midtown Modern D... Notwithstanding the drop in occupancy, prices and rentals have continued to rise amid inflationary pressures. For example, the overall price of industrial space increased by 1.5% q-o-q in 1Q2023 and 6.9% on a yearly basis. Meanwhile, industrial rents grew 2.8% q-o-q in 1Q2023 and 8.8% y-o-y. Moreover, the rise in industrial prices and rents in 1Q2023 continued to be supported by \u201cnew, innovative and diverse manufacturing activities\u201d that have started operations or are planning to, says Leonard Tay, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore. One example is Hyundai Motor Group's Innovation Centre that started operations at Jurong in April 2023 with the production of electric vehicles. The establishment is Singapore\u2019s first vehicle assembly plant.

The % change refers According to Tay Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy, JLL Singapore, warehouse rents posted a strong quarterly growth of 2.9% in 1Q2023. This was likely fuelled by a persistent supply crunch in this sector, and islandwide warehouse vacancy stays below the pressure point of 10% for the eighth consecutive quarter, she says. On the other hand, the rental indices for multiple-user and single-user factories each increased by 3.0% q-o-q. This means that factories stand out as the segment with the highest rental growth in 1Q2023. However, with an expected spike in supply for high-specification factory space and slowing demand on the back of a tempered manufacturing outlook, rental growth is expected to moderate going forward, says Catherine He, head of research, at Colliers. Where business parks are concerned, He of Colliers points out that that rents in this segment have grown 0.6% q-o-q in 1Q2023, with newer assets in the city-fringe outperforming older assets across the island. She adds that demand for business park space is expected to slow in light of prevailing macroeconomic conditions and higher supply coming onstream this quarter. Looking ahead, a slowdown in the manufacturing sector and lacklustre export performance over the coming months will coincide with a surge in new factory supply this year. This could result in slower rental growth of around 1.0% for conventional factories in general, says Brenda Ong, executive director for logistics & industrial at Cushman & Wakefield. Under the current economic environment, landlords with newer and quality assets will be better positioned to weather through the market uncertainty,\u201d says Tricia Song, head of research, Southeast Asia at CBRE. With choice spaces remaining limited, further rental increases in the near term can be expected, especially for prime logistics space. However, for landlords of older developments, they may consider embarking on asset enhancement initiatives and redevelopment works to remain relevant or offer incentives to retain tenants, says Song."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Against a backdrop of lacklustre external demand, non-oil domestic exports (NODX) contracted by 15.6% yoy for the fifth consecutive month in February. Manufacturing performance continued to contract, albeit from a high base, as industrial production fell for the fifth straight month by 8.9% yoy. Nonetheless, manufacturing sentiments have started to pick up, as China reopens. The Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up 0.2 points to 50 after five straight months of contraction and the electronics sector PMI rose 0.2 points to 49.3. Industrial Demand Sustains Despite Headwinds Despite a weaker economic outlook, most property types experienced rental growth in Q1 2023, except for conventional factory spaces which saw rents held constant, according to C&W's basket of industrial properties. Prime logistics properties and conventional warehouses outperformed in Q1 2023, with rents rising by 7.5% and 3.1% respectively qoq, driven by sustained demand from third-party logistics (3PL) players amidst very tight supply. Supported by active expansion plans of the knowledge sectors, especially the biomedical sector, high-tech properties witnessed further rental growth of 1.2% qoq from 0.4% qoq growth in Q4 2022, while city fringe business park's rental growth moderated slightly to around 0.5% qoq from previous quarter's 0.9% qoq growth. Industrial rental growth is expected to hold up this year, though performance will differ across property types. Due to its tight vacancies and low rental base, prime logistics could witness double-digit rental growth in 2023 as underlying demand from 3PL players remains surprisingly resilient, despite an easing of supply chain challenges and a weaker economic outlook. Given tight supply, most prime logistics occupiers are renewing their leases despite higher rents, and pent-up demand has continued to accumulate. The anticipated strong rental growth for prime logistics in 2023 comes on the back of high pre-commitments for major prime logistics supply completing this year. High-tech factories and business parks rents are expected to see moderate rental growth, with modern and high-spec developments leading growth as they can meet business requirements and sustainability targets of new economy tenants. Meanwhile, the manufacturing slowdown and lacklustre export performance coincides with a surge in factory supply coming forth this year, leading to a likelihood of slower rental growth of around 1.0% for conventional factories in general. While most new factory supply are single-user factory space and fully pre-committed, a portion of space could be sublet out into the market.

Following another quarter of elevated new completions, 1Q23 recorded the third consecutive quarter of negative net absorptions for industrial space. Total available stock rose by 357,000sqm while take-up during the quarter only increased by a marginal 5,000sqm. All four segments reported negative net absorption, and there was a decline in occupied stock for three out of the four segments. The warehouse, business park, and single-user factory segments reported a reduction in occupied space, while only the multi-user factory segment saw an increase in occupied space. Interestingly, despite the optimism surrounding the logistics sector, there was a decline of c.30,000sqm in occupied space for the warehouse segment. This was only the second quarter in over the past three years where the warehouse segment saw a decline in occupied stock. Similarly, for the business park segment, the c.18,000sqm decline in occupied space in 1Q23 marked only its second quarter of decline in over the past three years. Looking ahead, an estimated 1.0m sqm of new supply is expected to be delivered in the next three quarters of FY23. The bulk of the new supply for the year will come from the single-user factory segment (c.62%), c.21% will come from the warehouse segment, and the remaining c.17% will be attributed to the multiple-user factory and business park segments. This brings the total estimated new supply in FY23 to c.1.3m sqm, similar to the amount of new stock that came online last year. Singapore PMI remained in contractionary territory for the second consecutive month. Amid the global economic slowdown, Singapore's April PMI came in at 49.7, a 0.2 point decline from March. The contraction in PMI was led by the ninth consecutive quarter of contraction in the electronics sector (which represents 42% of manufacturing output), as demand of electronic goods from Singapore's major trading partners such as the US, Europe, and Japan, remains weak. Despite the earlier optimism of a rebound of the electronics sector as China reopens, it has largely driven domestic consumption and services so far, providing limited demand for exports. New orders and inventories for the electronics sector continue to contract, and the order backlog also recorded a decline after muted growth in the two months prior. On a y-o-y basis, Singapore's manufacturing output retreated by 4.2% in March 2023. Although transport engineering and biomedical manufacturing recorded an increase in output, general manufacturing, precision engineering, electronics, and chemical output declined y-o-y. Looking ahead, the Economic Development Board is expecting the output of electronics and chemicals to continue contracting in 2Q23. Consequently, employment in these two sectors is also expected to remain weak and potentially contract as well. What are we watching? Take-up rates of industrial properties. With the pick-up in new supply over the past few quarters, we continue to see negative net absorption in industrial properties. Most notable in 1Q23 was the decrease in occupied stock for warehouses despite the continued strength of the logistics sector. We believe that this may be a function of a timing difference between when the tenants return space at existing properties and when they physically occupy the new space. Judging by a similar trend seen last year (1Q22), the second quarter posted a strong rebound in occupied space for warehouses following a slight decline in the first quarter. With the EDB reporting a contraction in several sectors, such as electronics and precision engineering, coupled with expectations of a further slowdown in these sectors, we will be keeping a close eye on how this will impact the multiple-user and business park segments for the rest of FY23. Despite this, we believe that the biomedical sector, marine and offshore, and aerospace sectors will continue to support take-up and rents for the business park segment. The protracted rebound of the precision engineering and general manufacturing sectors in 2Q23 will also likely support continued rental growth for newer and high-specification multiple-user factory space.

Rental Index: Rentals for industrial properties are at a 5-year high Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * The overall Industrial Properties Rental Index has been on an uptrend since late FY20, likely due to a lack of new supply as construction delays hit. * The Industrial Properties Rental Index is currently at 100.4, a level not seen since the end of FY15. The rise in the rental index has mostly been driven by the multiple-user factory and warehouse segments. * The multiple-user and warehouse rental indices are currently at 99.8 and 95.5, respectively. The last time both rental indices were this high was between FY15 and FY16. * The Single-User Rental Index is currently at 104.1, the highest level since early FY16. * The Business Parks Rental Index is currently at 114.8, the highest level since FY10. 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 Rental Index Industrial Property Multi-User Single-User Warehouse Business Park Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 4 . Key Charts - Industrial Sector Bumper crop of new supply expected to continue into FY24F Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * A total of c.1.3m sqm of new industrial space is expected to be added to the market in FY23, almost the same amount of space that was added to the market last year. Similarly, the amount of new supply last year and this year is at the highest level since FY18. This is a result of a rollover in project completions from prior years, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to construction delays and disruptions to supply chains. * As compared to the start of FY23, it seems like the completion of c.0.5m sqm of new supply has been rolled over to the next two years, even as construction delays and supply chain disruptions ease. * Of the c.1.3m sqm of new supply that is expected to be delivered in FY23, single-user factory space contributes 62%, which is likely to have been developed by industrialists for their own use. * Delivery of new warehouse space in FY23 will constitute 21% of the supply, potentially easing the strong demand seen in FY21 and FY22. * Multiple-user factory space and business parks make up the remaining 17% of the upcoming supply. * Take-up of multiple-user and warehouse spaces has been healthy so far in FY21 and FY22, with positive net absorption, despite the delivery of new stock. However, the spike in supply expected in FY23 and FY24F may put some pressure on occupancy and rental rates going forward. - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F 2025F 2026F 000' sqm Supply Demand Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 5 .

The negative net absorption was mainly contributed by the single-user factory segment, while the other segments like warehouse and business parks reported a slowdown in take-up. * In the medium term, we expect net absorption to continue to stay in negative territory, leading to the softening of occupancy and rental rates, unless demand in FY23 surprises on the upside. 10.7% 10.8% 10.1% 9.8% 10.6% 11.0% 11.4% 11.4% 5.0% 6.0% 7.0% 8.0% 9.0% 10.0% 11.0% 12.0% (6.0) (4.0) (2.0) (0.0) 2.0 4.0 6.0 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F 2025F m' sqft Net Absorption Rate Market Vacancy Rate (%) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 6 .

However, we expect the trend to reverse in FY23 due to limited new supply. * The positive rental reversion cycle continued into FY22 for the warehouse and factory segments, owing to strong demand, despite the pick-up in new supply. * Overall rentals in the near term are expected to continue to remain healthy, even as more new supply is expected to come online. * Over the last two years, the logistics sector has been driven by the advancement of e-commerce and stockpiling activities.

Industrial Sub-sector - Multi-User Factory Multi-user factory supply: Supply spike in 2022 due to construction delays in previous two years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * New completions picked up in FY22 after more than three years of construction delays. A total of 634,000sqm of new supply of multi-user factory space was delivered in FY22, the largest increase in annual supply in over a decade. * Despite the spike in supply, take-up of multi-user factory space was very strong. A total of 442,000sqm of space was taken up in FY22, thereby cushioning the increase in the vacancy rate. The vacancy rate in FY22 was 10.9%, only a 100bps increase. * The sudden spike in both supply and demand in FY22 was likely a result of construction delays over the past three years and pent-up demand from businesses waiting to occupy the newly completed projects. Although we saw a slight increase in vacancy rates in FY22, overall occupancy is still at a very healthy level, the strongest seen in over a decade. * We are expecting another year of healthy supply for the multi-user factory space, with an estimated 235,000sqm of new supply projected to come online in FY23. Demand is also expected to taper off, as we believe most of the pent-up demand has already been satisfied. * We could see a slight increase in vacancy rates unless demand picks up and available stock is backfilled at a faster pace. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F 2025F '000 Sqm Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 8 . Multi-user factories: Surprise rebound in occupancy rate despite delivery of more stock Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * Rentals surprised on the upside with a c.8.2% increase in FY22 despite the spike in new supply delivered. This was likely due to cost inflation as well as higher rents that the newer multi-user factory commands. * As anticipated, occupancy rates dipped slightly due to the spike in delivery of new supply. Occupancy rates dipped 110bps in FY22 to c.89.1%, but this is still at a multi-year high. Aside from the past three years (where new supply was constrained by construction delays), occupancy rates are currently at the level last seen in FY13. * We expect some downward pressure in occupancy rates going ahead, as the market has to gradually backfill the bumper crop of new supply in FY22. * Rents could also see some downward pressure, but we believe it will remain relatively sticky in the near term. In fact, rentals in 1Q23 remain on an upward trajectory, rising 3.0% q-o-q. * However, occupancy and rents could surprise on the upside if there is any further slowdown in construction and new supply continues to be rolled over to the following years. 85% 86% 87% 88% 89% 90% 91% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023f 2024f 2025f 2026f 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 S$ psf pm Multi-User Factory Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 9 .

According to the Singstat Q1 2023 Business Expectations Survey, business sentiments for the manufacturing sector remained negative for the period January to June 2023, with transport engineering the exception. In addition, the Monthly Manufacturing Performance Report released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) reported that Singapore's manufacturing output decreased 8.9% y-o-y in February 2023, with bio-medical manufacturing declining the most substantially at 33.6%, resulting in slightly less demand for factory spaces for Q1 2023. As a result, the overall Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) in March 2023 contracted by a marginal 0.1 point to 49.9 after being in neutral territory at 50.0 in February. Prior to that, there were five consecutive months of contraction, while the electronics PMI has been under 50 for eight straight months. However, new, innovative, and diverse manufacturing activities have started or are planning operations, injecting vitality amid the dim market outlook. These include, the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre starting operations at Jurong in April 2023 with the production of electric vehicles, Singapore's first vehicle assembly plant in more than 40 years, and a first-of-its-kind in Singapore glass recycling plant operated by Abraclean, repurposing glass waste into new products at an over 170,000 sf facility in Pioneer. Esco Aster, a cell-based meat manufacturer will set up an 80,000 sf facility in Changi, while Commonwealth Kokubu Logistics (CKL) broke ground on a S$200 million 500,000 sf cold-chain food logistics facility at Jalan Besut. Both these facilities are expected to be ready in 2025. LOWER SALES AND LEASING ACTIVITY IN Q1 Given the softening business expectations, the first quarter of 2023 closed with a total amount of S$799.4 million in industrial sales, a decrease of 11.6% q-o-q. Nevertheless, there were several large deals such as the sale of four properties by Cycle & Carriage to M&G Real Estate for S$333 million, and J'Forte Building that was sold to Boustead Industrial Fund for almost S$100 million. Apart from these, about 97.3% of the caveats lodged during the quarter were for deals of S$10 million or lower. Similar to sales activity, the pace of leasing in January and February 2023 also moderated, although rents strengthened slightly across all property types. The islandwide leasing volume for multiple-user factories fell 1.5% q-o-q to 1,548 tenancies in January and February 2023 compared to the first two months of Q4 2022, but the median rent improved 4.7% q-o-q to S$2.01 psf pm.

Business parks performed better compared to other industrial property types this quarter. Islandwide, the total number of business park leasing deals increased 66.7% to 70 tenancies for the period of January and February 2023, compared to the two-month period of October and November 2022, with a majority in the Central Region due to a strong preference for accessibility. Additionally, median rents of business parks increased 1.4% q-o-q to S$4.22 psf pm, with some of the demand from life-sciences. RECORD FIXED ASSET INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS TO FACILITATE LONG-TERM GROWTH In 2022, Singapore recorded a total of S$22.5 billion in fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments, an increment of more than 90% compared to the S$11.8 billion in 2021. Out of the total inflow, about 77.2% was for manufacturing with 66.8% contributed by the electronics sector. Singapore's manufacturing sector was a key pillar of the economy during the pandemic, and now faces headwinds as a result of post-pandemic adjustments, inflation, ongoing supply chain disruptions as well as shortened business cycles in a general cloud of disruptive uncertainty. Nonetheless, the record FAI investments in 2022 particularly for manufacturing demonstrates the confidence and faith that technologically advanced and globally mobile manufacturers have in Singapore's stability, educated workforce and modern infrastructure, setting up the platform for a compelling rebound once this business cycle turns and certainty returns to the global economy.

MARKET OUTLOOK The outlook for industrial and logistics will remain stable with cautious price and rental growth of 1% to 3% for most industrial property types in 2023, despite the deteriorating business sentiment. Due to tight supply, quality logistics spaces can be expected to increase by a greater 3% to 5%. Furthermore, with China's reopening of borders, Chinese manufacturers could also be looking at alternative secure locations outside their home borders. With an aim of geographical diversification in order to mitigate the risks of production in an increasingly uncertain world, Singapore is an attractive alternative for companies to establish production facilities and headquarter functions for the region."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Growth in Q1/2023 was largely attributed to the expansion in the construction sector and services producing industries, particularly accommodation & food services, real estate, administrative & support services and other services sectors. The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, contracted 6.0% YoY in the fi rst quarter of 2023, a deceleration from the 2.6% drop in Q4/2022. This was due to output contractions across all manufacturing sectors, except for the transport engineering sector. The growth momentum in the manufacturing sector has been slowing in recent months, arising from increasing global growth concerns and a slowdown in the global electronics sector, particularly the semiconductor industry. The overall Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell back to contraction territory in March 2023 after having expanded in February 2023. The expansion came after fi ve consecutive months of contraction. The electronics PMI remained in contraction territory for an eighth consecutive month. In a similar light, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) also contracted on a YoY basis for a sixth consecutive month. In March 2023, it fell 8.3% YoY compared to the 15.8% YoY contraction in February 2023. RENTAL MARKET Following three consecutive quarters of YoY decline, leasing volume1 rebounded in Q1/2023, increasing 2.5% YoY to 3,229 tenancies in total. In the quarter, more tenancies were signed across all property types except the single-user factory segment. While leasing volume for multiple- user factory spaces rose 1.8% YoY in the quarter, leasing transactions for single-user factory spaces fell by a larger 17.5% YoY, as compared to the 15.5% decline in the previous quarter. Like the multiple-user factory segment, leasing transactions in the warehouse segment also increased by 12.1% in Q1/2023, a reversal from the 9.4% decline in the previous quarter. Due to a contraction in demand for single-user factory space and lower leasing transactions, the vacancy rate grew for a seventh consecutive quarter by 0.4 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 11.3% in Q1/2023, which was largely attributed to an increase in vacancy levels in the Central (+0.9 of a ppt), North East (+0.6 of a ppt) and West (+0.5 of a ppt) Regions. For the multiple-user factory segment, the islandwide vacancy rates rose for a third consecutive quarter by 0.2 of a ppt to 11.1% in the quarter. While vacancy 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). rates in the North-East and Central Planning Regions grew by 2.9 ppts and 0.8 of a ppt respectively, this was largely off set by declines in vacancy rates in the North (-1.8 ppts), East (-0.7 of a ppt) and West (-0.3 of a ppt) Planning Regions. Warehouse vacancy levels expanded in the quarter as well, increasing 1.4 ppts QoQ to 9.7% after declining in the previous quarter, which was attributed to an increase of 1.3 million sq ft in supply. This was the largest completed warehouse supply in a quarter since Q2/2021 when completions amounted to 2.8 million sq ft. Signifi cant increases in vacancy rates were observed in the North, West and North-East Planning Regions, increasing by 2.4 ppts, 1.9 ppts and 1.6 ppts respectively. Overall industrial rents continued to increase for a tenth consecutive quarter in Q1/2023, with JTC's rental index for all industrial properties rising by a larger 2.8% QoQ, compared to the 2.1% in Q4/2022. This was the largest quarterly increase since the rental index expanded 4.4% in Q3/2013. The rental index for both single-user and multiple- user factory spaces grew 3.0% QoQ, the largest rise since Q1/2014 and Q3/2013 when rents for single-user and multiple-user factory space rose by 3.5% and 4.4%. Similarly, JTC's rental index for warehouses increased by a larger 2.9% in Q1/2023, in comparison to the 2.2% QoQ growth in the previous quarter. This was the largest QoQ increase since warehouse rents rose 3.4% in Q4/2013. In a similar light, Savills' average monthly rents for prime multiple-user factories2 grew 0.9% QoQ to S$2.03 per sq ft in Q1/2023 after remaining unchanged in the previous quarter. For warehouse and logistics properties3, Savills' average monthly rents continued to increase further, albeit at a moderated pace of 0.4% QoQ to S$1.54 per sq ft, amid rising infl ation and strong demand for logistics and food spaces. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 across all segments continued falling for a third consecutive quarter, decreasing 22.3% QoQ to 349 transactions in Q1/2023. This was brought about by a slowdown in the manufacturing sector amid uncertainties in the global economy and a lacklustre electronics industry. The decline was largely evident for the multiple-user factory and warehouse segments, with sales volume for warehouses decreasing 28.0% QoQ to 18 transactions while multiple-user factories fell 22.2% QoQ to 330 transactions in the quarter. Despite a slowing transaction volume in the strata industrial sales market, industrial prices continued to escalate further, albeit at 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 5 May 2023.

Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for 60-year leasehold and freehold industrial properties rose by 2.2% and 1.6% QoQ to S$484 per sq ft and S$788 per sq ft respectively in Q1/2023. For freehold properties, prices have risen for a 14th consecutive quarter while 60-year leasehold properties have increased for a ninth consecutive quarter. The attractiveness of these properties may be attributed to the longer remaining leases and a scarcity of freehold properties. Similarly, prices of 30-year leasehold properties continued to rise for an eighth consecutive quarter by a smaller 0.5% QoQ to S$315 per sq ft. Properties which are centrally located were observed to have larger price increments. BUSINESS PARKS AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Vacancy levels of islandwide business parks increased for a second consecutive quarter by a smaller 1.2 ppts to 18.7% in Q1/2023, compared to the 2.7 ppts increase in the previous quarter. Demand for business parks may have weakened due to global economic uncertainties. Across the regions, the growth in vacancies was largely attributed to a 2.3 ppts growth in vacancy rates of business parks in the East Region, which was led by vacancy levels in Changi Business Park (CBP) increasing by a signifi cant 2.8 ppts to 26.3%. The GEAR at Changi Business Park Crescent was completed in the quarter, and this serves as Kajima Corporation's Asia Pacifi c headquarters. While this may have contributed to the signifi cant increase in vacancy rates, in subsequent quarters, the moving in of the occupiers who called for the construction of the building may result in vacancy rates in the area stabilising. On the other hand, vacancy rates in Cleantech Park declined further by a smaller 1.1 ppts to 47.4% in the quarter. Nevertheless, business park rents remained strong, particularly for prime properties. Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents rebounded in Q1/2023, reversing the marginal decline of 0.3% in the previous quarter and registering a QoQ increase of 0.6% to S$5.95 per sq ft. On the other hand, monthly rents of Savills' standard business park properties6 continued to fall for a second consecutive quarter by a marginal 0.3% QoQ to S$3.99 per sq ft. With the prime-quality specifi cations of high-spec buildings, there is still strong occupier demand for such properties, resulting in rising rents. According to Savills' high-spec industrial basket7, the average monthly rent for high- spec industrial properties rose for a seventh consecutive quarter at a slightly higher 0.7% QoQ 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. are domestic will fi nd respite in the form of either government pump priming eff orts or the continuing practice of stocking up inventory to hedge against infl ation and potential supply chain disruptions. Still, while this may lend support on the multiple-user factory and warehousing front, if interest rates remain elevated, demand from the domestic sector may wane over time when margins thin out. Nevertheless, for the next two to three quarters, we may get to see both price and rental support from the multiple-user factory and warehousing segments of the industrial market, particularly those focused on the domestic front. For business parks, so long as the tech sector does not pull out of its dive, conditions will remain challenging.

OUTLOOK On the one hand, fundamentals in the industrial market appears to be fl ashing amber as vacancies are rising across broad segments of the market. On the other, rents and prices are going against the grain. In particular, vacancy levels for single-user factories rose for a seventh consecutive quarter by 0.4 of a ppt QoQ to 11.3% in Q1/2023 while rents and prices continue to rise signifi cantly. For instance, rents for single- user factories rose 3.0% QoQ in Q1/2023. In the warehouse segment, although vacancy levels increased 1.4 ppts QoQ, JTC's statistics show that rents rose by a sharp 2.9% QoQ in the quarter in review. On the transaction front, the same story of rising sales prices across the various tenures of industrial space was recorded. While the metrics like vacancies correlate with the general economic malaise confronting the manufacturing sector, rents and prices appear to be trending the other way. One interpretation of this divergence is that it is only short-term in nature and soon, both rents and prices may fall back in line to refl ect the challenging economic circumstances. If rents and prices were measured in real terms i.e. after accounting for infl ation, this could already have been happening. However, there is more to just pinning the reason down to infl ation. In our Q2/2022 Industrial Briefi ng, we mentioned that domestic pump priming eff orts may result in industrial demand being channelled to the multiple user space market. We see this playing out in Q1/2023 when more tenancies were signed across all property types except the single- user factory segment. While leasing volume for multiple-user factory spaces rose 1.8% YoY in the quarter, leasing transactions for single-user factory spaces fell by a larger 17.5% YoY. The Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) serving the domestic market are those that are often found in multiple-user factories. Multinational Companies are often located in single-user factories. In other words, the global economic slowdown and tech sector restructuring is impacting the single user factory as well as the business park space market.
