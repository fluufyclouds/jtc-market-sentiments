In a press release on Sept 18, Savills Singapore says that the increase was due to more tenancies signed for multiple-user factory spaces, which went up 10.6% y-0-y and is the highest since 2021. However, leasing transactions for single-use factory and warehouse segments fell by 5.7% and 13% y-o-y, respectively. Based on a basket of industrial properties tracked by Savills, the prices for 30-year and 60-year leasehold industrial properties increased by 1.4% and 2.4% q-o-q to $320 psf and $495 psf, respectively. The report expects further growth in prices and rents for the rest of the year in most industrial property types despite escalating headwinds and subdued growth in the manufacturing sector, Demand for multiple-user factories is likely driven by new growth areas, such as high-value manufacturing industries, while rents are forecasted to increase by 4% to 6%. Rents for warehouses are also expected to grow by 3% to 5% due to the strong demand for modern and high-specification logistics spaces and the limited supply of quality warehouses. Alan Cheong, Savills Singapore's executive director for research and consultancy, notes that both rents and prices for industrial and warehouses should continue to rise for the rest of the year. \"One factor keeping these two afloat is inflation. The other is higher interest rates. As most landlords are financially strong, it puts them in better stead to pass their higher interest expenses to tenants,\u201d Cheong adds."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

These facilities are also able to cater to tenants with smaller space requirements. Nonetheless, the healthy supply for factories may outpace new demand, with 61% of upcoming supply during H2 2023 consisting of single-user factories. With continued uncertainty and higher costs, occupiers may become more cautious in their expansion plans, thereby impacting demand. 2 All Industrial The JTC All Industrial price and rental indices continued their eleventh consecutive quarter of growth during Q2 2023, reaching their highest levels since Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 respectively. This was despite the fact that trade indicators remain soft, with continuous contractions recorded in manufacturing output, NODX and PMI. Warehouse Warehouses registered a rental increase of 1.4% QOQ, down from the 2.8% growth during the previous quarter as more supply came on stream. Colliers has observed that demand for newer and high- specification warehouses remained strong; while older warehouses were also sought after by occupiers with less demanding requirements. With warehouses making up only 22% of the future supply for H2 2023, overall warehouse rental growth may moderate further in the coming quarters as a weaker economy translates to less stockpiling, and as occupiers focus more on operational efficiency than expansion. Business Parks Business Park rents have risen by 1.3%, accelerating from last quarter's 0.6% increase, supported by flight to quality moves and driven by assets in the One-North precinct. However, despite tight vacancies at the city fringe assets, island-wide occupancies continued to decline as supply outpaced demand, falling by 0.7 pp. Rental growth and occupancies may ease as more supply comes on stream, coupled with slowing enquiries and economic growth.

With a remaining supply of 6.7 mil sf during 2023, and an average of 10.5 mil sf from present till 2025, higher supply will continue to moderate rental and price growth; compared with the average net absorption of 7.7 mil sf from 2021 till present. Supply is expected to stay ahead of demand, which could also provide more options for occupiers. Industrial indicators such as manufacturing output and NODX have exhibited their eighth consecutive month of contraction during Q2 2023, and PMI its fourth consecutive month of contraction, largely driven by an extended slowdown in the semiconductor cycle, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainties and prolonged elevation of interest rates. As such, the external environment is set to remain a key source of weakness for some time with further export softness ahead. All these factors may serve to slow both rental and price growth during the coming quarters. Nevertheless, demand for higher specification industrial assets will continue to support the industrial market, underpinned by demand from industries such as advanced manufacturing, logistics, biomedical, and food sectors; with several corporations expanding their facilities or looking to establish a presence in Singapore, which will help to prop up industrial demand.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Weaker Manufacturing Outlook Singapore's economy grew by 0.4% yoy in Q1 2023, slowing from previous quarter's 2.1% growth. In May, non-oil domestic exports (NODX) recorded a decline of 14.7% yoy, for the eighth consecutive month, while manufacturing output shrank by 10.8% yoy, raising the risks of a technical recession. However, overall factory activity improved slightly; the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up 0.2 point to 49.7 while the electronics PMI declined by 0.1 point to 49.0 in June. This suggests that while Singapore's manufacturing economy remains under pressure due to weak external demand, the outlook could be starting to stablise. A multi-speed Market As industrial demand weakens, rental growth has started to diverge in Q2 2023, with varying performance across industrial segments. Property types with limited new supply are still seeing positive rental growth. Prime logistics rents grew 2.2% qoq, easing from previous quarter's 7.5% qoq growth, as vacancy rates remain tight. Factory and warehouse rents held constant in the quarter, while rents of business parks in outlying areas declined slightly by 0.5% qoq. Older outlying business park developments are facing stronger pressure due to hybrid work and an influx of new supply. Meanwhile, high-tech properties and city fringe business parks rents rose by 0.3% qoq and 0.4% qoq respectively, supported by resilient demand from tech and life science occupiers. Science Park rents growth grew 0.7% qoq compared to 0.2% qoq growth in Q1 2023, though this was driven by higher rents at two developments. More Investment Sales Opportunities There could be more opportunities for industrial investment sales in the horizon. Given rising flight to quality and sustainability demand coupled with limited new industrial supply, there will be increasing interest for asset enhancements or redevelopments of ageing industrial assets. It may be timely for owner-occupiers to consider sale-and-leaseback arrangement or joint development. Also, given the current high interest rate environment, there could potentially be more industrial opportunities on the market as REITs look to lower their gearing ratio. This could be an opportune time for prospective industrial investors, as availability of institutional grade industrial assets are limited.

Although Singapore narrowly avoided a technical recession, the overall economic growth was dragged down by a downturn in the manufacturing sector. While the other sectors posted an expansion in Q2, manufacturing shrank 7.3% YoY, extending the 5.4% contraction registered in Q1. This was attributed to output contractions across all manufacturing sectors, except for transport engineering. In the face of higher interest rates and strong infl ationary pressures, Singapore's manufacturing sector faces weaker demand from major trading partners like China. The city-state's exports have shown no signs of picking up yet, with Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) contracting for the ninth consecutive month in June. Manufacturing PMI has also weakened for three straight months in July, and electronics PMI remains subdued. RENTAL MARKET The leasing activity in the industrial market remained active, with leasing volume1 rising 6.1% YoY to 3,298 tenancies in Q2/2023. The increase was due to more tenancies signed for multiple-user factory spaces, which rose 10.6% YoY to its highest in the last two years. Meanwhile, leasing transactions for single-user factory and warehouse segments fell by 5.7% and 13.6% YoY respectively. Although leasing activity for the two segments had been down, the rents recorded in Q2 were higher than a year ago. Apart from rental increases, the higher total rental value could be due to a rebound in demand for larger facilities. The vacancy rate for multiple-user factory fell 1.0 percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.1% in Q2, reversing three consecutive quarters of increase. This rate is the lowest since Q4/2021. While vacancy rate for single-user factory remained relatively fl at at 11.4% in Q2 (11.3% in Q1), that for warehouse eased 0.7 of a ppt QoQ to 9.0% in Q2. The improvement was largely attributed to healthy take-up in the West and North Planning Region. JTC's overall industrial rents continued to increase further for eleven consecutive quarters in Q2/2023, reaching its highest record in the last eight years. Rents rose across the board in Q2, albeit at a slower pace for single-user factory and warehouse spaces. Nonetheless, prime rents remained strong, with Savills' average monthly rents for prime 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). multiple-user factories2 rising by 5.3% QoQ to S$2.13 per sq ft in Q2. Alongside rising infl ation and strong demand for logistics and food spaces, the average monthly rents for prime warehouse and logistics properties3 in the Savills' basket increased by 4.5% QoQ to S$1.61 per sq ft in Q2. SALES MARKET Following three consecutive quarters of decline, strata industrial sales activity4 increased 8.4% QoQ to 424 transactions in Q2. Although there are factors such as high interest rates and a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, sales activity started to show recovery across all segments of the industrial property type. While multiple- user factory saw the slowest recovery (4.6% QoQ), single-user factory and warehouse recorded an uptick of 44.0% and 28.6% QoQ in their respective sales volume. Despite the increase in sales volume, the total transaction value for single- and multiple- user factory segments fell in Q2. This could imply that buyers are more attracted to more palatable size and quantum, given uncertain future business conditions, and higher borrowing costs. Industrial prices also continued growing, with the JTC price index rising consecutively since Q2/2021. The Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that in Q2/2023, prices for 30- and 60-year leasehold industrial properties increased by 1.4% and 2.4% QoQ to S$320 per sq ft and S$495 per sq ft respectively. Owing to higher fi nancing costs, some demand could have shifted to properties with shorter leases and more aff ordable quantum. The quantum play could lead to faster price escalation for the leasehold properties in future. On the other hand, the rate of price growth for freehold properties continued to moderate in Q2. Compared with 1.6% QoQ in Q1, prices for freehold properties rose 1.1% QoQ to S$797 per sq ft.

Nonetheless, some landlords could have lowered their rental expectations to keep their premises occupied. This might have led to a 1.0% QoQ decline in Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents to S$5.89 per sq ft in Q2. On the other hand, some landlords of the standard business park properties with better accessibility and amenities might have better negotiating power to raise their rents after experiencing quarters of rental decline. As a result, the monthly rents of Savills' standard business park properties6 recorded an uptick of 3.2% QoQ to S$4.11 per sq ft in Q2, a reversal of a two-quarter decline. Owing to the prime-quality specifi cations of high-spec buildings, the occupier demand for such spaces remained strong, hence resulting in further rental growth in Q2. According to Savills' high- spec industrial basket7, the average monthly rent increased 2.3% QoQ in Q2 to S$3.83 per sq ft. OUTLOOK As outlook for the global economic growth remains lacklustre, local manufacturers are bracing for continuing challenges in 2H/2023. Although infl ation is showing signs of easing, they are still elevated and could restart rising. Also, margins are being squeezed as competition heats up when business conditions become tougher. Singapore manufacturers grapple with weak demand from the major economies, especially when large markets like China are experiencing a slower- than-expected reopening. We believe that this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. leases may see prices being forced up by a cascade of downgraders. Ultimately, when push comes to shove, an entrepreneur will need to raise cash or reduce his burn and the shorter term industrial properties will provide that avenue for him/her to raise liquidity. For business parks, looking beyond the current tech winter, there should be sustainable interest in the medium term. This comes from the tight supply in business park space where we have new supply collapsing from 3.3 million sq ft GFA in 2024 to 818,000 sq ft GFA in 2025. Thereafter, the JTC statistics show no supply. For high-spec industrial space, demand has been strong, underpinned by the rise of high-value manufacturing industries such as advanced manufacturing, technology and biomedical science fi rms. High-spec industrial spaces with modern facilities and excellent accessibility are expected to see healthy demand amid tight supply. With that, overall rents for prime business park and high-spec industrial space are forecast to continue to trend up this year. We believe that both rents and prices for industrial and warehouses should continue to rise in 2023. One factor keeping these two afl oat is infl ation. The other is higher interest rates. Also, as most landlords are fi nancially strong, it puts them in a better position to pass their higher interest expenses on to tenants.

The latter is a move by manufacturers to build other plants outside China to hedge against future supply chain disruption. Thus, not only do we have a global-ex-US economic slowdown, but South-East Asia (with the exception of Vietnam) also faces a dilution of demand/supply of goods and services coming from China due to the re-routing of supply chains. Despite escalating headwinds and subdued growth in the manufacturing sector, most industrial property types are expected to see further growth, with prices and rents remaining on an upward trend for the rest of the year. While demand for multiple-user factories is likely to be driven by new growth areas such as high-value manufacturing, rents are forecast to increase by 4% to 6% in 2023. Owing to limited supply for quality warehouse space, rents for warehouses are also expected to grow by 3% to 5% in view of the strong demand for modern and high-specifi cation logistics spaces. The challenges facing manufacturers, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), will motivate those who have excess industrial space or are holding onto assets with longer term leases to either sub-let or arbitrage the lease by downgrading to those with a shorter lease term.

SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - In 1Q2023, the overall occupancy rate for the industrial property market fell to 88.8%, according to the latest quarterly market report by JTC. This is a fall of 0.6 percentage points compared to the previous quarter and a decline of 1.0 percentage points compared to the same period a year ago. The fall in overall occupancy is due to new project completions in 1Q2023 as new industrial supply continues to exceed demand, says JTC. The statutory board says that around 10.76 million sq ft of new industrial space is expected to be completed for the whole of 2023. Of the upcoming supply, single-user factory space makes up about 62%, warehouse space makes up 21%, while the remaining 17% comprises multiple-user factory and business park space. Q As a result, the end of 1Q2023 saw total available industrial real estate stock increased to around 3.84 million sq ft, while total occupied stock increased by 53,820 sq ft in 1Q2023 compared to the previous quarter. FE Midtown Modern D... Notwithstanding the drop in occupancy, prices and rentals have continued to rise amid inflationary pressures. For example, the overall price of industrial space increased by 1.5% q-o-q in 1Q2023 and 6.9% on a yearly basis. Meanwhile, industrial rents grew 2.8% q-o-q in 1Q2023 and 8.8% y-o-y. Moreover, the rise in industrial prices and rents in 1Q2023 continued to be supported by \u201cnew, innovative and diverse manufacturing activities\u201d that have started operations or are planning to, says Leonard Tay, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore. One example is Hyundai Motor Group's Innovation Centre that started operations at Jurong in April 2023 with the production of electric vehicles. The establishment is Singapore\u2019s first vehicle assembly plant.

The % change refers According to Tay Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy, JLL Singapore, warehouse rents posted a strong quarterly growth of 2.9% in 1Q2023. This was likely fuelled by a persistent supply crunch in this sector, and islandwide warehouse vacancy stays below the pressure point of 10% for the eighth consecutive quarter, she says. On the other hand, the rental indices for multiple-user and single-user factories each increased by 3.0% q-o-q. This means that factories stand out as the segment with the highest rental growth in 1Q2023. However, with an expected spike in supply for high-specification factory space and slowing demand on the back of a tempered manufacturing outlook, rental growth is expected to moderate going forward, says Catherine He, head of research, at Colliers. Where business parks are concerned, He of Colliers points out that that rents in this segment have grown 0.6% q-o-q in 1Q2023, with newer assets in the city-fringe outperforming older assets across the island. She adds that demand for business park space is expected to slow in light of prevailing macroeconomic conditions and higher supply coming onstream this quarter. Looking ahead, a slowdown in the manufacturing sector and lacklustre export performance over the coming months will coincide with a surge in new factory supply this year. This could result in slower rental growth of around 1.0% for conventional factories in general, says Brenda Ong, executive director for logistics & industrial at Cushman & Wakefield. Under the current economic environment, landlords with newer and quality assets will be better positioned to weather through the market uncertainty,\u201d says Tricia Song, head of research, Southeast Asia at CBRE. With choice spaces remaining limited, further rental increases in the near term can be expected, especially for prime logistics space. However, for landlords of older developments, they may consider embarking on asset enhancement initiatives and redevelopment works to remain relevant or offer incentives to retain tenants, says Song."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Industrial Demand Sustains Despite Headwinds Despite a weaker economic outlook, most property types experienced rental growth in Q1 2023, except for conventional factory spaces which saw rents held constant, according to C&W's basket of industrial properties. Prime logistics properties and conventional warehouses outperformed in Q1 2023, with rents rising by 7.5% and 3.1% respectively qoq, driven by sustained demand from third-party logistics (3PL) players amidst very tight supply. Supported by active expansion plans of the knowledge sectors, especially the biomedical sector, high-tech properties witnessed further rental growth of 1.2% qoq from 0.4% qoq growth in Q4 2022, while city fringe business park's rental growth moderated slightly to around 0.5% qoq from previous quarter's 0.9% qoq growth. Industrial rental growth is expected to hold up this year, though performance will differ across property types. Due to its tight vacancies and low rental base, prime logistics could witness double-digit rental growth in 2023 as underlying demand from 3PL players remains surprisingly resilient, despite an easing of supply chain challenges and a weaker economic outlook. Given tight supply, most prime logistics occupiers are renewing their leases despite higher rents, and pent-up demand has continued to accumulate. The anticipated strong rental growth for prime logistics in 2023 comes on the back of high pre-commitments for major prime logistics supply completing this year. High-tech factories and business parks rents are expected to see moderate rental growth, with modern and high-spec developments leading growth as they can meet business requirements and sustainability targets of new economy tenants. Meanwhile, the manufacturing slowdown and lacklustre export performance coincides with a surge in factory supply coming forth this year, leading to a likelihood of slower rental growth of around 1.0% for conventional factories in general. While most new factory supply are single-user factory space and fully pre-committed, a portion of space could be sublet out into the market.

Following another quarter of elevated new completions, 1Q23 recorded the third consecutive quarter of negative net absorptions for industrial space. Total available stock rose by 357,000sqm while take-up during the quarter only increased by a marginal 5,000sqm. All four segments reported negative net absorption, and there was a decline in occupied stock for three out of the four segments. The warehouse, business park, and single-user factory segments reported a reduction in occupied space, while only the multi-user factory segment saw an increase in occupied space. Interestingly, despite the optimism surrounding the logistics sector, there was a decline of c.30,000sqm in occupied space for the warehouse segment. This was only the second quarter in over the past three years where the warehouse segment saw a decline in occupied stock. Similarly, for the business park segment, the c.18,000sqm decline in occupied space in 1Q23 marked only its second quarter of decline in over the past three years. Looking ahead, an estimated 1.0m sqm of new supply is expected to be delivered in the next three quarters of FY23. The bulk of the new supply for the year will come from the single-user factory segment (c.62%), c.21% will come from the warehouse segment, and the remaining c.17% will be attributed to the multiple-user factory and business park segments. This brings the total estimated new supply in FY23 to c.1.3m sqm, similar to the amount of new stock that came online last year. Singapore PMI remained in contractionary territory for the second consecutive month. Amid the global economic slowdown, Singapore's April PMI came in at 49.7, a 0.2 point decline from March. The contraction in PMI was led by the ninth consecutive quarter of contraction in the electronics sector (which represents 42% of manufacturing output), as demand of electronic goods from Singapore's major trading partners such as the US, Europe, and Japan, remains weak. Despite the earlier optimism of a rebound of the electronics sector as China reopens, it has largely driven domestic consumption and services so far, providing limited demand for exports. New orders and inventories for the electronics sector continue to contract, and the order backlog also recorded a decline after muted growth in the two months prior. On a y-o-y basis, Singapore's manufacturing output retreated by 4.2% in March 2023. Although transport engineering and biomedical manufacturing recorded an increase in output, general manufacturing, precision engineering, electronics, and chemical output declined y-o-y. Looking ahead, the Economic Development Board is expecting the output of electronics and chemicals to continue contracting in 2Q23. Consequently, employment in these two sectors is also expected to remain weak and potentially contract as well. What are we watching? Take-up rates of industrial properties. With the pick-up in new supply over the past few quarters, we continue to see negative net absorption in industrial properties. Most notable in 1Q23 was the decrease in occupied stock for warehouses despite the continued strength of the logistics sector. We believe that this may be a function of a timing difference between when the tenants return space at existing properties and when they physically occupy the new space. Judging by a similar trend seen last year (1Q22), the second quarter posted a strong rebound in occupied space for warehouses following a slight decline in the first quarter. With the EDB reporting a contraction in several sectors, such as electronics and precision engineering, coupled with expectations of a further slowdown in these sectors, we will be keeping a close eye on how this will impact the multiple-user and business park segments for the rest of FY23. Despite this, we believe that the biomedical sector, marine and offshore, and aerospace sectors will continue to support take-up and rents for the business park segment. The protracted rebound of the precision engineering and general manufacturing sectors in 2Q23 will also likely support continued rental growth for newer and high-specification multiple-user factory space.

The negative net absorption was mainly contributed by the single-user factory segment, while the other segments like warehouse and business parks reported a slowdown in take-up. * In the medium term, we expect net absorption to continue to stay in negative territory, leading to the softening of occupancy and rental rates, unless demand in FY23 surprises on the upside. 10.7% 10.8% 10.1% 9.8% 10.6% 11.0% 11.4% 11.4% 5.0% 6.0% 7.0% 8.0% 9.0% 10.0% 11.0% 12.0% (6.0) (4.0) (2.0) (0.0) 2.0 4.0 6.0 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F 2025F m' sqft Net Absorption Rate Market Vacancy Rate (%) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 6 . Rental reversion trend expected to remain healthy in the coming years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * After several years of negative rental reversions (three-year cycle) for the factory and warehouse segments, the trend reversed in FY21. * Positive rental reversions for business parks have been tapering off in the past two years and were slightly negative in FY22. However, we expect the trend to reverse in FY23 due to limited new supply. * The positive rental reversion cycle continued into FY22 for the warehouse and factory segments, owing to strong demand, despite the pick-up in new supply. * Overall rentals in the near term are expected to continue to remain healthy, even as more new supply is expected to come online. * Over the last two years, the logistics sector has been driven by the advancement of e-commerce and stockpiling activities. This has led to the outperformance of rentals for the warehouse segment, and we believe its outperformance will continue through to the coming years. -20% -10% 0% 10% 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F 2025F % reversions (3-year cycle) Business Park Warehouse Factory Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 7 . Industrial Sub-sector - Multi-User Factory Multi-user factory supply: Supply spike in 2022 due to construction delays in previous two years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * New completions picked up in FY22 after more than three years of construction delays. A total of 634,000sqm of new supply of multi-user factory space was delivered in FY22, the largest increase in annual supply in over a decade. * Despite the spike in supply, take-up of multi-user factory space was very strong. A total of 442,000sqm of space was taken up in FY22, thereby cushioning the increase in the vacancy rate. The vacancy rate in FY22 was 10.9%, only a 100bps increase. * The sudden spike in both supply and demand in FY22 was likely a result of construction delays over the past three years and pent-up demand from businesses waiting to occupy the newly completed projects. Although we saw a slight increase in vacancy rates in FY22, overall occupancy is still at a very healthy level, the strongest seen in over a decade. * We are expecting another year of healthy supply for the multi-user factory space, with an estimated 235,000sqm of new supply projected to come online in FY23. Demand is also expected to taper off, as we believe most of the pent-up demand has already been satisfied. * We could see a slight increase in vacancy rates unless demand picks up and available stock is backfilled at a faster pace. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F 2025F '000 Sqm Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 8 . Multi-user factories: Surprise rebound in occupancy rate despite delivery of more stock Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * Rentals surprised on the upside with a c.8.2% increase in FY22 despite the spike in new supply delivered. This was likely due to cost inflation as well as higher rents that the newer multi-user factory commands. * As anticipated, occupancy rates dipped slightly due to the spike in delivery of new supply. Occupancy rates dipped 110bps in FY22 to c.89.1%, but this is still at a multi-year high. Aside from the past three years (where new supply was constrained by construction delays), occupancy rates are currently at the level last seen in FY13. * We expect some downward pressure in occupancy rates going ahead, as the market has to gradually backfill the bumper crop of new supply in FY22. * Rents could also see some downward pressure, but we believe it will remain relatively sticky in the near term. In fact, rentals in 1Q23 remain on an upward trajectory, rising 3.0% q-o-q. * However, occupancy and rents could surprise on the upside if there is any further slowdown in construction and new supply continues to be rolled over to the following years. 85% 86% 87% 88% 89% 90% 91% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023f 2024f 2025f 2026f 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 S$ psf pm Multi-User Factory Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 9 .

According to the Singstat Q1 2023 Business Expectations Survey, business sentiments for the manufacturing sector remained negative for the period January to June 2023, with transport engineering the exception. In addition, the Monthly Manufacturing Performance Report released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) reported that Singapore's manufacturing output decreased 8.9% y-o-y in February 2023, with bio-medical manufacturing declining the most substantially at 33.6%, resulting in slightly less demand for factory spaces for Q1 2023. As a result, the overall Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) in March 2023 contracted by a marginal 0.1 point to 49.9 after being in neutral territory at 50.0 in February. Prior to that, there were five consecutive months of contraction, while the electronics PMI has been under 50 for eight straight months. However, new, innovative, and diverse manufacturing activities have started or are planning operations, injecting vitality amid the dim market outlook. These include, the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre starting operations at Jurong in April 2023 with the production of electric vehicles, Singapore's first vehicle assembly plant in more than 40 years, and a first-of-its-kind in Singapore glass recycling plant operated by Abraclean, repurposing glass waste into new products at an over 170,000 sf facility in Pioneer. Esco Aster, a cell-based meat manufacturer will set up an 80,000 sf facility in Changi, while Commonwealth Kokubu Logistics (CKL) broke ground on a S$200 million 500,000 sf cold-chain food logistics facility at Jalan Besut. Both these facilities are expected to be ready in 2025. LOWER SALES AND LEASING ACTIVITY IN Q1 Given the softening business expectations, the first quarter of 2023 closed with a total amount of S$799.4 million in industrial sales, a decrease of 11.6% q-o-q. Nevertheless, there were several large deals such as the sale of four properties by Cycle & Carriage to M&G Real Estate for S$333 million, and J'Forte Building that was sold to Boustead Industrial Fund for almost S$100 million. Apart from these, about 97.3% of the caveats lodged during the quarter were for deals of S$10 million or lower. Similar to sales activity, the pace of leasing in January and February 2023 also moderated, although rents strengthened slightly across all property types. The islandwide leasing volume for multiple-user factories fell 1.5% q-o-q to 1,548 tenancies in January and February 2023 compared to the first two months of Q4 2022, but the median rent improved 4.7% q-o-q to S$2.01 psf pm.

Business parks performed better compared to other industrial property types this quarter. Islandwide, the total number of business park leasing deals increased 66.7% to 70 tenancies for the period of January and February 2023, compared to the two-month period of October and November 2022, with a majority in the Central Region due to a strong preference for accessibility. Additionally, median rents of business parks increased 1.4% q-o-q to S$4.22 psf pm, with some of the demand from life-sciences. RECORD FIXED ASSET INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS TO FACILITATE LONG-TERM GROWTH In 2022, Singapore recorded a total of S$22.5 billion in fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments, an increment of more than 90% compared to the S$11.8 billion in 2021. Out of the total inflow, about 77.2% was for manufacturing with 66.8% contributed by the electronics sector. Singapore's manufacturing sector was a key pillar of the economy during the pandemic, and now faces headwinds as a result of post-pandemic adjustments, inflation, ongoing supply chain disruptions as well as shortened business cycles in a general cloud of disruptive uncertainty. Nonetheless, the record FAI investments in 2022 particularly for manufacturing demonstrates the confidence and faith that technologically advanced and globally mobile manufacturers have in Singapore's stability, educated workforce and modern infrastructure, setting up the platform for a compelling rebound once this business cycle turns and certainty returns to the global economy.

MARKET OUTLOOK The outlook for industrial and logistics will remain stable with cautious price and rental growth of 1% to 3% for most industrial property types in 2023, despite the deteriorating business sentiment. Due to tight supply, quality logistics spaces can be expected to increase by a greater 3% to 5%. Furthermore, with China's reopening of borders, Chinese manufacturers could also be looking at alternative secure locations outside their home borders. With an aim of geographical diversification in order to mitigate the risks of production in an increasingly uncertain world, Singapore is an attractive alternative for companies to establish production facilities and headquarter functions for the region."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Growth in Q1/2023 was largely attributed to the expansion in the construction sector and services producing industries, particularly accommodation & food services, real estate, administrative & support services and other services sectors. The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, contracted 6.0% YoY in the fi rst quarter of 2023, a deceleration from the 2.6% drop in Q4/2022. This was due to output contractions across all manufacturing sectors, except for the transport engineering sector. The growth momentum in the manufacturing sector has been slowing in recent months, arising from increasing global growth concerns and a slowdown in the global electronics sector, particularly the semiconductor industry. The overall Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell back to contraction territory in March 2023 after having expanded in February 2023. The expansion came after fi ve consecutive months of contraction. The electronics PMI remained in contraction territory for an eighth consecutive month. In a similar light, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) also contracted on a YoY basis for a sixth consecutive month. In March 2023, it fell 8.3% YoY compared to the 15.8% YoY contraction in February 2023. RENTAL MARKET Following three consecutive quarters of YoY decline, leasing volume1 rebounded in Q1/2023, increasing 2.5% YoY to 3,229 tenancies in total. In the quarter, more tenancies were signed across all property types except the single-user factory segment. While leasing volume for multiple- user factory spaces rose 1.8% YoY in the quarter, leasing transactions for single-user factory spaces fell by a larger 17.5% YoY, as compared to the 15.5% decline in the previous quarter. Like the multiple-user factory segment, leasing transactions in the warehouse segment also increased by 12.1% in Q1/2023, a reversal from the 9.4% decline in the previous quarter. Due to a contraction in demand for single-user factory space and lower leasing transactions, the vacancy rate grew for a seventh consecutive quarter by 0.4 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 11.3% in Q1/2023, which was largely attributed to an increase in vacancy levels in the Central (+0.9 of a ppt), North East (+0.6 of a ppt) and West (+0.5 of a ppt) Regions. For the multiple-user factory segment, the islandwide vacancy rates rose for a third consecutive quarter by 0.2 of a ppt to 11.1% in the quarter. While vacancy 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). rates in the North-East and Central Planning Regions grew by 2.9 ppts and 0.8 of a ppt respectively, this was largely off set by declines in vacancy rates in the North (-1.8 ppts), East (-0.7 of a ppt) and West (-0.3 of a ppt) Planning Regions. Warehouse vacancy levels expanded in the quarter as well, increasing 1.4 ppts QoQ to 9.7% after declining in the previous quarter, which was attributed to an increase of 1.3 million sq ft in supply. This was the largest completed warehouse supply in a quarter since Q2/2021 when completions amounted to 2.8 million sq ft. Signifi cant increases in vacancy rates were observed in the North, West and North-East Planning Regions, increasing by 2.4 ppts, 1.9 ppts and 1.6 ppts respectively. Overall industrial rents continued to increase for a tenth consecutive quarter in Q1/2023, with JTC's rental index for all industrial properties rising by a larger 2.8% QoQ, compared to the 2.1% in Q4/2022. This was the largest quarterly increase since the rental index expanded 4.4% in Q3/2013. The rental index for both single-user and multiple- user factory spaces grew 3.0% QoQ, the largest rise since Q1/2014 and Q3/2013 when rents for single-user and multiple-user factory space rose by 3.5% and 4.4%. Similarly, JTC's rental index for warehouses increased by a larger 2.9% in Q1/2023, in comparison to the 2.2% QoQ growth in the previous quarter. This was the largest QoQ increase since warehouse rents rose 3.4% in Q4/2013. In a similar light, Savills' average monthly rents for prime multiple-user factories2 grew 0.9% QoQ to S$2.03 per sq ft in Q1/2023 after remaining unchanged in the previous quarter. For warehouse and logistics properties3, Savills' average monthly rents continued to increase further, albeit at a moderated pace of 0.4% QoQ to S$1.54 per sq ft, amid rising infl ation and strong demand for logistics and food spaces. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 across all segments continued falling for a third consecutive quarter, decreasing 22.3% QoQ to 349 transactions in Q1/2023. This was brought about by a slowdown in the manufacturing sector amid uncertainties in the global economy and a lacklustre electronics industry. The decline was largely evident for the multiple-user factory and warehouse segments, with sales volume for warehouses decreasing 28.0% QoQ to 18 transactions while multiple-user factories fell 22.2% QoQ to 330 transactions in the quarter. Despite a slowing transaction volume in the strata industrial sales market, industrial prices continued to escalate further, albeit at 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 5 May 2023.

Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for 60-year leasehold and freehold industrial properties rose by 2.2% and 1.6% QoQ to S$484 per sq ft and S$788 per sq ft respectively in Q1/2023. For freehold properties, prices have risen for a 14th consecutive quarter while 60-year leasehold properties have increased for a ninth consecutive quarter. The attractiveness of these properties may be attributed to the longer remaining leases and a scarcity of freehold properties. Similarly, prices of 30-year leasehold properties continued to rise for an eighth consecutive quarter by a smaller 0.5% QoQ to S$315 per sq ft. Properties which are centrally located were observed to have larger price increments. BUSINESS PARKS AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Vacancy levels of islandwide business parks increased for a second consecutive quarter by a smaller 1.2 ppts to 18.7% in Q1/2023, compared to the 2.7 ppts increase in the previous quarter. Demand for business parks may have weakened due to global economic uncertainties. Across the regions, the growth in vacancies was largely attributed to a 2.3 ppts growth in vacancy rates of business parks in the East Region, which was led by vacancy levels in Changi Business Park (CBP) increasing by a signifi cant 2.8 ppts to 26.3%. The GEAR at Changi Business Park Crescent was completed in the quarter, and this serves as Kajima Corporation's Asia Pacifi c headquarters. While this may have contributed to the signifi cant increase in vacancy rates, in subsequent quarters, the moving in of the occupiers who called for the construction of the building may result in vacancy rates in the area stabilising. On the other hand, vacancy rates in Cleantech Park declined further by a smaller 1.1 ppts to 47.4% in the quarter. Nevertheless, business park rents remained strong, particularly for prime properties. Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents rebounded in Q1/2023, reversing the marginal decline of 0.3% in the previous quarter and registering a QoQ increase of 0.6% to S$5.95 per sq ft. On the other hand, monthly rents of Savills' standard business park properties6 continued to fall for a second consecutive quarter by a marginal 0.3% QoQ to S$3.99 per sq ft. With the prime-quality specifi cations of high-spec buildings, there is still strong occupier demand for such properties, resulting in rising rents. According to Savills' high-spec industrial basket7, the average monthly rent for high- spec industrial properties rose for a seventh consecutive quarter at a slightly higher 0.7% QoQ 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. are domestic will fi nd respite in the form of either government pump priming eff orts or the continuing practice of stocking up inventory to hedge against infl ation and potential supply chain disruptions. Still, while this may lend support on the multiple-user factory and warehousing front, if interest rates remain elevated, demand from the domestic sector may wane over time when margins thin out. Nevertheless, for the next two to three quarters, we may get to see both price and rental support from the multiple-user factory and warehousing segments of the industrial market, particularly those focused on the domestic front. For business parks, so long as the tech sector does not pull out of its dive, conditions will remain challenging.

OUTLOOK On the one hand, fundamentals in the industrial market appears to be fl ashing amber as vacancies are rising across broad segments of the market. On the other, rents and prices are going against the grain. In particular, vacancy levels for single-user factories rose for a seventh consecutive quarter by 0.4 of a ppt QoQ to 11.3% in Q1/2023 while rents and prices continue to rise signifi cantly. For instance, rents for single- user factories rose 3.0% QoQ in Q1/2023. In the warehouse segment, although vacancy levels increased 1.4 ppts QoQ, JTC's statistics show that rents rose by a sharp 2.9% QoQ in the quarter in review. On the transaction front, the same story of rising sales prices across the various tenures of industrial space was recorded. While the metrics like vacancies correlate with the general economic malaise confronting the manufacturing sector, rents and prices appear to be trending the other way. One interpretation of this divergence is that it is only short-term in nature and soon, both rents and prices may fall back in line to refl ect the challenging economic circumstances. If rents and prices were measured in real terms i.e. after accounting for infl ation, this could already have been happening. However, there is more to just pinning the reason down to infl ation. In our Q2/2022 Industrial Briefi ng, we mentioned that domestic pump priming eff orts may result in industrial demand being channelled to the multiple user space market. We see this playing out in Q1/2023 when more tenancies were signed across all property types except the single- user factory segment. While leasing volume for multiple-user factory spaces rose 1.8% YoY in the quarter, leasing transactions for single-user factory spaces fell by a larger 17.5% YoY. The Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) serving the domestic market are those that are often found in multiple-user factories. Multinational Companies are often located in single-user factories. In other words, the global economic slowdown and tech sector restructuring is impacting the single user factory as well as the business park space market.
