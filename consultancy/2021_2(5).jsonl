Rental values refer to warehouse-logistics rents. Yields refer to industrial properties with 30-year land leases. Total net absorption grew 58.4% HOH to 5.5 million sq ft in H1 2021, driven by an increase in demand for factories. We remain optimistic on the sector in 2021 as the manufacturing sector continues to recover. Planned supply for 2021 remains high at 1.6x the 10- year historical average, 69% of which comes from factories, although construction delays could potentially avert an oversupply situation. We forecast warehouse-logistics rent to grow 1.3% in 2021 on sustained demand from e-commerce growth. Rents of other industrial segments should also recover along with the economic recovery. We expect overall industrial vacancy rates to rise in 2021 from higher planned factory supply. Vacancy could improve from 2023 onwards as supply tapers off. We expect overall capital values to remain stable, possibly rising for selected prime data centres and logistics properties, due to rising rents.

Manufacturing continued to outperform in Q2 2021, expanding by 18.5% YOY, with growth supported by output expansions in all clusters except for the biomedical manufacturing cluster. Over the next 10 years, Singapore intends to grow its manufacturing sector by 50%, maintaining its contribution at about a fifth of economic output over the medium term. According to Colliers' research, average monthly industrial gross rents declined 0.4% HOH in H1 2021, as supply jumped 8.5x HOH. Warehouse rents did well rising 0.7% HOH to SGD1.22 (USD0.91) per sq ft, while Business Park rents weakened 1.2% HOH after being the most resilient segment in 2020. Based on data from JTC, all- industrial occupancy improved marginally by 0.2ppts to 90.1% in H1 2021, led by Multi-user factories which saw occupancy rise 1.2ppts HOH to 89.7%, while all other segments saw a drop in occupancy as landlords prioritised rents over occupancy amid a recovery. As supply completions gain momentum, 2021 supply, 69% of which is factory space, looks abundant at 21.3 million sq feet (2.0 million sq metres) barring further construction delays. This is equivalent to 1.6x the 10-year historical average as factory supply is scheduled to increase 5.1x YOY. As such, we expect all- industrial vacancy to rise 1.4 ppt to 11.5% by end of 2021. Recovery underway in 2021 In 2021, we expect the industrial sector to recover along with the overall economy, with Oxford Economics forecasting GDP growth of 6.4% in 2021. We forecast sustained warehouse demand to drive 1.3% YOY rental growth, the highest among all segments, led by ramp-up logistics space. Business Park and Factory rents could rise at a slower rate of 0.5% YOY and 0.7% YOY respectively given ample supply. We expect rents of hi-specs space to grow 0.8%, supported by the technology sector. All-industrial new supply, new demand & vacancy rate Colliers average monthly industrial gross rents declined 0.4% HOH in H1 2021 due to higher supply, but Warehouse rents did well rising 0.7% HOH.

Notably, transactions of Single-user factories, a laggard in H2 2020, jumped 214% HOH in value and 50% HOH in number of caveats, reflecting some pent-up demand.

Interest for industrial assets from property funds and REITs continues, particularly in Hi-specs space, Factories and Warehouses. There were a few major deals transacted in H1 2021, including the establishment of Boustead Industrial Fund and Ascendas REIT's purchase of a 75% stake in Galaxis.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Singapore Economy Got Back on Track Singapore economy turned around by 1.3% yoy in Q1 2021, while the labour market has improved with unemployment rate falling to 2.6% in the same period. The outperforming manufacturing sector continued to be the main GDP driver, expanding by 10.7% yoy in Q1 2021. Based on data released by EDB, manufacturing growth between January and May 2021 has been led by output expansions in three key sub-sectors - Electronics that soared 22.9% yoy, Precision Engineering that rose 22.7% yoy and Chemicals that increased 10.3% yoy. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stayed in expansion territory at 50.8 points in June 2021, even as community infection cases resurged and pandemic measures tightened in the region. City Fringe Business Parks Leading the Pack in Growth Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, city fringe business park rents registered the highest growth of 2.3% qoq in Q2 2021, as vacancy rates continue to fall to 7.8% in Q2 2021 compared to 9.9% in the preceding quarter. Blue chip corporations across the thriving technology and pharmaceutical sectors have been drawn to city fringe business parks due to the robust infrastructure and favourable locality to reach talents and users. Coupled with firms in CBD decentralising more back-end functions such as R&D, the city fringe business park segment is expected to achieve the highest growth rate in 2021. The segment's sanguine outlook is also backed by strong investment sales such as Ascendas Reit acquiring the remaining 75% stake in Galaxis for $534m. Science Park, high tech, prime logistics and warehousing spaces also outperformed in tandem with the K-shaped economic recovery, registering a qoq rental growth of 0.6%, 0.2%, 1.6% and 0.9% respectively. These segments that cater to the rapidly expanding advanced manufacturing and e-commerce sectors, will see higher rental growth potential amid increasing demand and limited supply. In contrast, outlying business park rents continued to be pulled down by older developments, dropping by 0.5% qoq in Q1 2021, while factory rents held steady due to limited new supply. Broad-based Growth Expected across Factory Spaces Towards the End of 2021 Amidst the recovering economy, widespread growth in the industrial market, including all segments of factory spaces, are expected towards the end of 2021 or early 2022. As output demand continues to grow, more manufacturing firms could seize the opportunity to expand, positioning for growth amidst roll-out of vaccines and reopening of global economies. Expansions of food establishments and cloud kitchens will continue to drive demand for food zone factories, while electronics occupiers will go on to pursue high-specification factory spaces amidst digital transformation. For instance, GlobalFoundries was reported to be investing over $4 billion to build a new fabrication plant in Singapore to meet the unprecedented global demand for chips. Although demand for conventional factory spaces has faltered, their rents will hold firm this year, as new supply may be further delayed due to labour constraints and tightened measures. This is also supported by the 6.2% yoy (January to May 2021 YTD) expansion of the general manufacturing sector in terms of manufacturing outputs.

Investment volume for Q2 2021 was boosted by residential and industrial transactions. For the residential sector, investment sales increased by 92.6% quarter-on-quarter to $3.098 bn, mainly due to the sale of three Government Land Sales (GLS) sites (Northumberland Road, Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, and Tengah Garden Walk (EC)). Excluding these GLS sites, residential sales volume still stood at $1.871 bn, attributed to healthy activity in the luxury market for good class bungalows and luxury apartments. This reflects the confidence both private buyers and developers have in the long-term future and potential of Singapore real estate market. Industrial transactions kept its pace at $992.06 mil this quarter. This reflects just a slight 7.9% drop q-o-q from the large transactions and Boustead portfolio deal recorded last quarter. AREIT acquired the remaining 75% interest in Galaxisfor $534 mil, while ESR REIT acquired Global Trade Logistics Centre, a prime logistics facility for $119.6 mil. In addition to these two major transactions, another eight factories and five warehouses were transacted.The active real estate investment sales scene in Singapore indicates that there is abundant liquidity waiting to be deployed, with investors undeterred by travel restrictions and the recent heightened measures. Undeniably, technology had a big part to play with facilitating deals through virtual viewings and presentations.For the remaining quarters of 2021, in addition to some attractive and relatively large GLS sites which have their tenders closing, there are also a handful of large-quantum quality commercial assets coming onto the market. These should provide a further boost to investment volumes. Consequently, CBRE Research believes that investment sales volume for 2021 is likely to see a strong rebound from the previous year, led by residential, office, and industrial sales.

Initially, leasing momentum gathered pace as business sentiment improved and more staff were allowed to return to the office. However, the emergence of COVID-19 clusters led to the tightening of measures in May. Under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), restrictions were imposed to curb the transmission of the virus. Once again, work from home became the default working arrangement and these restrictions impacted leasing enquiry levels.Net absorption was -0.36 mil sq. ft. in Q2 2021, which was contributed by the earlier relocation moves and downsizing efforts by occupiers. Coupled with the injection of the uncommitted supply in Afro-Asia, islandwidevacancy rate rose from 5.9% in Q1 2021 to 6.8% in Q2 2021. With limited new and expansionary demand, most of the leasing transactions comprised renewals and relocations. Key demand drivers were confined to the technology and financial services sectors, and to a lesser degree, transport & storage, and energy & commodities firms. As a result of earlier relocation moves, Grade A vacancy rates rose from 3.3% in Q1 2021 to 4.4% in Q2 2021. Nevertheless, this remained well below the 10-year historical average vacancy rate of 5.9%. Encouraged by the fairly tight vacancy rate in the Grade A market, some landlords of better performing buildings have begun to push for higher rents as they benefit from the prevailing tightness. In Q2 2021, Grade A Core CBD rents rose 1.0% q-o-q to $10.50 psf/month, the first rental growth since Q4 2019. Conversely, the Grade B market struggled to backfill the existing vacant stock, and this placed further pressure on Grade B Core CBD rents.Looking forward, there are still potential risks on the demand side, but the tapering supply pipeline bodes well for the market. It remains a two-tiered market; the medium-term outlook for the Grade A market looks positive, but the recovery in the Grade B market is likely to lag the Grade A market as landlords grapple with rising vacancy rates.

Islandwidenet absorption was 0.13 mil sq. ft. in Q2 2021. The two business parks that obtained TOP in Q2 2021 were located in one-north: Razer's SEA headquarters along one-north Crescent and Wilmar's headquarters along BiopolisRoad. This resulted in 0.16 mil sq. ft. of net supply. With net absorption trailing behind net supply, islandwidevacancy rate rose marginally from 12.9% in Q1 2021 to 13.0% in Q2 2021. The only firms that exhibited expansionary appetite within the business park sector were those in the technology and media industries. While most of the leasing demand was concentrated within the new builds of higher specifications within the City Fringe submarket, some positive take-up was also noted in the Rest of Island submarket in this quarter. Given the high vacancy rates in the Rest of Island submarket, landlords maintained some flexibility in rental negotiations, and this helped to shore up occupancy levels. In Q2 2021, rents in the Rest of Island submarket kept stable at $3.65 psf/month. On the other hand, the City Fringe submarket continued to be underpinned by tight availability of space for lease. With strong demand for space in this submarket, City Fringe rents expanded by 0.9% q-o-q to $5.80 psf/month in Q2 2021. Over the next three and a half years, a total of 5.04 mil sq. ft. of new supply is expected to come onstream. With only 13.2% of upcoming supply located within the City Fringe submarket, any rental growth is likely to stem from the one-north precinct as this submarket is underpinned by tight availability of space and high demand. However the same level of optimism is not reflected in the other submarkets; with 86.8% of upcoming supply located within the Rest of island submarket, there is likely to be further downward pressure on rents in the Rest of Island submarket. Nonetheless, overall demand for the business park market remains resilient.

MARKETVIEWThe retail market encountered another setback with stricter measures during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 16 May till 13 June 2021. Retail sales (excluding motor vehicles), posted a decline of 6.3% m-o-m in May 2021, with department stores, wearing apparel & footwear and watches & jewellery the most affected. It was observed that F&B operators were more adjusted to delivery and takeaway with the dine-in ban, as compared to last year's \"circuit breaker\" period. Amongst the physical constraints that COVID-19 posed this year, the Great Singapore Sales took an omnichannel format, with e-commerce platforms being actively involved.Despite the uncertainty, new openings and expansions were observed in the F&B, sporting goods and fashion segment. That said, for certain segments, the number of closures outweighed openings, with fashion, F&B and entertainment segments having the highest number of casualties. For instance, Karaoke Manekinekoclosed all its outlets; Marche Movenpick and Food Republic closed its Raffles City and Capitol Piazza outlet respectively, while TEMT and Abercrombie & Fitch exited the Singapore market. With work-from-home remaining as the default and tourism borders still closed, the retail market continue to face pressures though the magnitude of rental decline has slowed. Islandwide prime retail rents fell by 0.4% q-o-q this quarter, as compared to -1.2% q-o-q in Q1 2021. This was mainly propped up by the suburban market, where prime spaces registered healthy reversionary rents. As such, the rental gap between Orchard and suburban markets narrowed further.Even though the retail market is poised to benefit from an improvement in economic activity and consumer sentiment on the back of the vaccination rollout, the retail sector has yet to reach full recovery. Secondary outbreaks could continue to disrupt economic activity and tightening of border controls will be a continued setback to the market recovery for the rest of 2021.

Preliminary estimates for new home sales year to date came to 5,652 units, which is already 56.6% of the volume achieved last year. This was bolstered by the year to date sales of Irwell Hill Residences (332 units), Provence Residence (245 units) and Normanton Park (191 units). With safe distancing measures at show galleries relaxed, this momentum is likely to continue as developers are encouraged to proceed with their launches, with more mass market launches in the pipeline.According to URA's flash estimates, private residential property prices rose 0.9% in Q2 2021, a slowdown compared to Q1 2021's 3.3% increase. Within the non-landed segment, the stronger price increase in the OCR (1.8% q-o-q) was weighed down by the CCR (0.6% q-o-q) and RCR (0.3% q-o-q). The slower growth could be attributed to a slower pace of launches due to restrictions in the first half of May, pushing buyers to the resale market. Further, the trend for larger homes may have resulted in lower psfprices for some projects. There was also healthy take-up from earlier launches in the suburban market, which signifies resilient demand from upgraders.Private property prices have increased by 4.3% year to date. The moderation in price growth might have lowered the risks of cooling measures being implemented. While the government is expecting a GDP growth forecast of 4-6%, the launch of some upcoming projects at higher psf pricing might continue to push the price index higher to exceed this forecast.New launches have been predominantly located in the CCR and RCR locations year-to-date. However, the next few major launches will mostly be mass-market projects in the OCR. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, CBRE Research expects new home sales to fall within the region of 10,000 to 11,000 units for 2021. In the longer term, the potential reopening of borders will also bring about the return of foreign investors and buying interest to the luxury segment.

Manufacturing output rose by 30.0% y-o-y in May, its fastest pace in a decade due to the low base effect in part to \"circuit breaker\" measures last year. Highest increases were observed in biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering clusters, due to higher production of semiconductor equipment. NODX increased 8.8% y-o-y in May 2021, the sixth consecutive month of exports growth, while SIPMM's PMI sustained its expansion for the eleventh consecutive month in June 2021.Leasing activity continued to remain stable in Q2 2021, consisting of new set ups and relocations. Warehouse leasing volume increased the fastest, with third-party logistics and marine & offshore being the main demand drivers. Furthermore, recent commitments byBioNTechand Sanofi to build their vaccine production facility in Singapore shows the endorsements of the biopharmaceutical segment, which bodes well for Singapore's advanced manufacturing scene in the mid to long term. On the back of healthy demand, factory rents tracked by CBRE Research registered its first quarter of increase by 0.7% q-o-q in Q2 2021. Space availability for the warehouse and prime logistics remained tight, hence rents for both segments began to materialise at a quicker pace, by 1.3% q-o-q and 2.9% q-o-q respectively. Moving forward, the positive outlooks for Singapore's manufacturing and e-commerce sectors will underpin demand for quality factory and warehouse space. Warehouse rents are expected to grow at a faster pace as vacancies among prime logistics remain extremely low, in addition to a more manageable warehouse pipeline. Take-up for JTC Logistics Hub @ Gul and LOGOS Tuas Logistics Hub have been healthy, driven by e-commerce, food stockpiling and third-party logistics storage for pharmaceutical and oil & gas. On the other hand, the rental performance for the factory submarket could be weighed down by older stock, as the submarket remains two-tier.

It came on the back of the manufacturing sector's 10.7% yoy growth, faster than the 10.3% growth recorded in 4Q 2020. * The two worst performing sectors in 4Q 2020, namely construction and the transportation and storage sector, saw expansion during this quarter. The construction sector contracted by 22.7% yoy in 1Q 2021 (compared with -27.4% in 4Q 2020) and the transportation and storage sector shrank by 16.5% (compared with -27.4% in 4Q 2020). * Singapore attracted $2.8bn in FAI in 1Q 2021, a slight decrease from $3.0bn in 4Q 2020 with the services sector leading at $1.6bn. The info-communications and media cluster within the service sector drew $1.1bn of FAI. Investors from the United States contributed the most to the total FAI in 1Q 2021. Singapore's efforts to keep borders open, stay connected, and ensure business continuity have given global firms the confidence to invest in projects in the Republic. * The labour market continued to recover from the impact of the pandemic. The unemployment rate declined to 2.9% in 1Q 2021 from 3.3% in 4Q 2020. Employment grew in 1Q 2021 by 14,000 workers after four quarters of decline. In 1Q 2021, the bulk of the employment increases were in services. The unemployment rate for May declined to 2.8%. * Inflation may pick up due to low base effects from last year but is unlikely to step up excessively in the second half of 2021. External inflation expected to rise in the near term amid the recovery in global oil prices and the rebound of the world's two largest economies i.e. the US and China. As for Singapore, price pressures are likely to gradually pick up as the labour market and private consumption nudged up. * The external economic environment has improved since February 2021 mainly due to upgrades in the growth outlook for advanced economies like the United States. * While the tightening of domestic restrictions and border controls in May 2021 represented a setback to segments of the Singapore economy, this was partially relaxed partially in June 2021 and the broader economy should still see a recovery this year in tandem with the global economic rebound and further progress in the domestic vaccination programme. * On 25 May 2021, MTI forecasted Singapore's economic growth in the range of 4% to 6% in 2021. While a survey conducted by MAS of private- sector economists on 14 June 2021 showed that Singapore's GDP tipped to grow 6.5% in 2021, led by manufacturing and exports. * Singapore is reopening in a calibrated manner and will have more confidence to ease up further when two- thirds of the population is fully vaccinated by National Day (9 August), as targeted.

As there was no activity in GLS in 1Q 2021, the government sold three residential sites in this quarter. The tenders drew intense competition from 7 to 15 bidders per site, who ran out of land amid healthy home sales. * Commercial sales in 2Q 2021 comprised 15% office, 8% retail and 4% shop house deals. In addition, the transactions for office and retail sales were predominantly strata-titled transactions or acquisitions of the remaining stakes of investors' existing properties. * Ascendas Reit acquired the remaining 75% interest in Galaxis. It now has full ownership of the property. Galaxis is a business park located in One-North which houses key growth sectors such as biomedical sciences, information and communications technologies and media, science and research institutes as well as start-ups. * Subsidiaries from SingHaiyi, Chip Eng Seng and Hong Kong-listed Chuan Holdings won the collective sale tender for Maxwell House, a 13-storey commercial building, which has potential for redevelopment into a mixed-use development. * Lendlease Global Commercial Reit proposed to increase its effective interest to 31.8% in Jem, which is a 108,170sqm mixed- use development comprising of retail (major use) and office. Key tenants include Singapore's Ministry of National Development, Swedish furniture chain IKEA, hypermarket FairPrice Xtra and fashion retailers H&M and Uniqlo. * RESIDENTIAL: The government is releasing more private housing sites for sale in 2H 2021 by almost 25%, under the Confirmed List of the GLS programme, due to the dwindling unsold inventory of the private housing units. Amidst robust housing demand and riding on the positive market outlook, more developers are actively seeking to replenish their residential land banks, which may result in stiffer competition to secure a site. * RETAIL: This sector expected to take longer to recover given the lack of tourists, the return of tighter measures due to the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, and the impact of remote working. These may add pressure on occupancy and investment activities. * OFFICE: There are uncertainties over the longer-term impact of remote working on office demand. Healthy buildings are the new minimum and there is an increasing need for space that can flexibly adapt to the requirements of a post-Covid world, where the role of the office shifts towards collaboration and innovation. * INDUS TRIAL: We obser ve that investments in data centres, logistics and warehouse facilities, as well as cloud kitchens are on the rise. Covid-19 has brought many opportunities for new businesses. With the industrial upswing speeding ahead, it may be apt to innovate and invest in business expansion towards research & development and advanced manufacturing. Additionally, under the Industrial GLS programme, more industrial land totalling 5.14ha will be available for sale in 2H 2021, increased from 3.86ha in 1H 2021. 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH OFFICE - Occupiers value flexibility 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2021 2022 2023 2024 Under Construction Planned mn sq ft KEY HIGHLIGHTS Average monthly gross rents (SGD/sq ft) SUPPLY - Singapore OFFICE SUPPLY (sq ft) OFFICE SUPPLY PIPELINE (2021-2024) (sq ft) As of 2Q 2021, nearly 4.6mn sq ft of new office space will be completed from 2021 to 2024, down from 4.9mn as of 1Q 2021.

The improvement fuelled by the decentralised regions, which experienced the highest positive net absorption, a testament to the trend of decentralisation, as more companies opt for offices located outside the CBD. * Occupancy rate for CBD has fallen by 0.7% pts in 2Q 2021 from 92.7% in 4Q 2020. As companies re-evaluate their business operations needs due to Covid-19, they are rethinking their real estate footprint, with some preferring the \"asset light\" approach. This approach enables them to have some cost savings from office rents, flexibility and also allow them to transit their office spaces into an avenue for collaboration and socialisation. * The recent Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) curbs have resulted in working-from-home still being the default arrangement in Singapore, resulting in thinner crowds at hot office spots. However, with Singapore hastening its roll out of vaccination and controlling the spread of the virus, we expect more office goers to return to their offices to work, albeit on a more flexible basis. * As companies revaluate their office spaces and the economy gradually recovers, the trend of flexible workspaces expected to continue, as seen from the expansion plans of the co-working operator, JustCo. In March 2021, JustCo announced its plans to open an office in Tampines located at Asia Green and further announced in June 2021 that they will manage and occupy two floors at The Metropolis in Buona Vista, the only Grade-A office located in One-North precinct. * Tenants continues to shift towards better quality buildings, as better property management by developers provide a higher ventilation system in buildings which prevents the spread of Covid-19. A safe work environment translates to better employee well-being and productivity. * Office demand is bolstered by Information and communications, finance, and insurance sectors. Employment in these sectors has improved and fuelled by government support, job schemes and overseas foreign investment. The MAS is projecting 6,500 jobs in the finance sector this year, while retaining existing employees. The demand and expansion of the technology workforce by companies have contributed significantly to employment. * Monthly rents in the various subzones of the office sector held steady or declined slightly in 2Q 2021. Within the CBD and Non-CBD subzones, there is a continued emphasis on a flight to quality office spaces while taking advantage of the current climate to negotiate better rates for office rentals. Overall, we expect a bottom in the office market by the end of the year. 8 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL - Expected to ride on global trade growth 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 First-storey multiple-user factory Upper-storey multiple-user factory $ psf 70 80 90 100 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1Q 2021 Single-user factory Multiple-user factory Business park Warehouse % KEY HIGHLIGHTS RENTAL OF FIRST STOREY MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY OCCUPANCY RATE OF MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY Buoyant prospects for the manufacturing sector drove the slight 1.0% qoq increase in rent.

The purchasing managers' index (PMI) recorded a marginal increase in June 2021, with a reading of 50.8, marking the 12th straight month expansion (i.e., with a reading above 50) from 50.7 in May. The increase was attributed to faster expansion rates in the key indices of new orders, new exports, factory output, inventory and employment. * Non-oil exports (NODX) rose 9.7% yoy in 1Q 2021 reversing the dip of 0.5% in 4Q 2021. The expansion was driven by electronic products such as integrated circuits, personal computers, telecom gear and non-electronic products like specialised machinery, petrochemicals, primary chemicals. * Overall industrial net absorption decreased from 2.3mn sq ft in 4Q 2020 to 1.5mn sq ft in 1Q 2021. Demand was contributed by the multiple-user factory segment (1.0mn sq ft) and warehouse segment (0.6mn sq ft), while the negative business park segment showed negative net absorption of 0.1mn sq ft. * Island-wide, only the multiple-user factory occupancy rate increased in 1Q 2021 (0.6% qoq). The rest of the occupancy rates for other industrial segments decreased with business park declining the most at 0.8% qoq. * Approximately 46% of the supply pipeline will be completed in 2021, followed by 33% in 2022. Multiple- user factories accounted for the bulk (33%) of the supply pipeline with approximately 13.7mn sq ft NLA. Single-user factory space made up 22% of the supply pipeline, projected to be about 9.0mn sq ft NLA. * The full-year trajectory for manufacturing remains sound which saw little impact from stricter Covid-19 measures during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). * Barring a worsening of the Covid-19 situation, the manufacturing sector is expected to be one of the key pillars of growth, as export-oriented industries ride on global trade growth. * Prices and rentals of industrial space are likely to remain stable for 2021 with higher-than-average supply pipeline balancing off with improving demand. * We see substantial investments in new economy assets like data centres. For instance, in May 2021, Mapletree Industrial Trust proposed a US$1.32b acquisition of 29 data centres in the United States. Likewise, in June 2021, Singapore-based Princeton Digital revealed that it is investing US$1b to build a data centre campus in Japan. In March 2021, Ascendas Reit announced its US$0.67b acquisition of 11 data centres in Europe. In 2019, the Singapore government imposed a moratorium (temporary pause) on new data centres built locally due to concerns over the industry's carbon footprint. The local authorities are expected to provide an update on the moratorium situation at the end of the year. * The shift of food & beverage (F&B) sales online, triggered by Covid-19, drove the growth of cloud kitchens. We see cloud kitchen as an emerging niche market segment with significant growth opportunities. For instance, Singapore-based Select Group, announced in March 2021 their plans to invest S$10 million to open 20 cloud kitchens locally over the next five years. 10 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Orchard/Scotts Road 88.4% Fringe/Suburban Areas 93.3% Other City Areas 88.6% SUPPLY OF RETAIL SPACES (2021-2024) (sq ft) The largest development in the immediate term is the A&A to i12 Katong, featuring new retail tenants such as PS Cafe and Climb Asia.

The occupancy rate increased by 0.3% pts qoq to 91.5% in 1Q 2021 from 91.2% in 4Q 2020. * The occupancy rate for the Fringe/ Suburban area improved by 0.8% pts to 93.3% in 1Q 2021. More retailers prefer to open their shops located at the Fringe/Suburban subzone due to the sustained footfall and the continuation of the work-from-home arrangements for some companies, especially for the food and beverage sectors located at suburban malls. * The 3-month moving average of yoy change in retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) improved from -5.7% in December 2020 to 35.2% in May 2021. Retail sales grew for the third consecutive month yoy, implying an improvement in retail sales as Singapore continues to gradually open its economy. * Retail sales for furniture & household equipment, recreational goods, watches & jewellery and computer & telecommunications continued to grow yoy in 1Q 2021. Consumers were still cautious in their spending of discretionary items. For 1Q 2021, watches & jewellery reported the highest growth in sales of 22.6% yoy. However, food & alcohol declined the most by 26.2% yoy. * For the food and beverage services index for 1Q 2021, food caterers reported the greatest decline of 60.4% yoy, due to the continued restriction of large gatherings, resulting in the low demand for event catering. Restaurants sales registered a moderated improvement of -33.1% yoy in 4Q 2020 to a -6.3% in 1Q 2021. * As more retailers jump onto the bandwagon of setting up online stores to drive sales, Robinsons has recently announced that it will partner with Grab and return as an online department store. Additionally, with the Great Singapore Sale (GSS) taking an omni-channel approach this year, we expect more retailers to reinvent and adopt this new approach to drive sales. By partnering with Lazada, retailers can leverage the ease of accessibility of applications and online platforms. * As retail tenants face a challenging business climate amid tightening social distancing restrictions and capacity limits, landlords should continue managing their expectations in terms of retail rents. Support extended to assist retailers, in terms of rental incentives, more flexible operating hours and digital marketing of products to reach broader consumers. * We expect potential upside for retail rents in the Fringe/Suburban Areas, given the continued strong retail performance and the tight supply pipeline. With the lack of tourism and office crowd due to the work- from-home arrangement, landlords of retail malls at Orchard/Scotts Road and Other City Areas are more flexible their commercial terms, to optimize their trade mix. 12 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 1Q 2011 1Q 2012 1Q 2013 1Q 2014 1Q 2015 1Q 2016 1Q 2017 1Q 2018 1Q 2019 1Q 2020 1Q 2021 Residential pipeline Total unsold Years to clear unsold based on 3-year moving average new sales per annum (RHS) Units Years 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 100,000 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Units RESIDENTIAL - Sustained interest in the private residential sector as economy charts its path of recovery 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 1Q 2011 3Q 2011 1Q 2012 3Q 2012 1Q 2013 3Q 2013 1Q 2014 3Q 2014 1Q 2015 3Q 2015 1Q 2016 3Q 2016 1Q 2017 3Q 2017 1Q 2018 3Q 2018 1Q 2019 3Q 2019 1Q 2020 3Q 2020 1Q 2021 All Residential Price Index Landed Non-landed 1Q 2009 = 100 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 1Q 2011 1Q 2012 1Q 2013 1Q 2014 1Q 2015 1Q 2016 1Q 2017 1Q 2018 1Q 2019 1Q 2020 1Q 2021 Primary sales Secondary sales Residential launches* Unit KEY HIGHLIGHTS PROPERTY PRICE INDEX OF ALL PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES RESIDENTIAL PIPELINE SUPPLY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SALES TRANSACTION VOLUME PRIVATE HOME RENTAL TRANSACTIONS In 2Q 2021, based on URA's flash estimate, the Property Price Index (PPI) for all private residential properties, including Executive Condominiums, rose for the fifth consecutive quarter by 0.9% qoq to 163.7. This rise attributed to a 0.8% qoq increase in the PPI for landed private properties to 186.9, and a 0.9% qoq increase in the PPI for non-landed private properties to 158.5 in 2Q 2021. The residential supply pipeline decreased qoq in 1Q 2021. The total number of unsold units dropped 11.1% qoq. Correspondingly, the time needed to clear the unsold units have shrunk to 2.6 years from 2.9 years in 4Q 2020, based on a 3-year moving average of 9,563 units per annum for take-up of new units. Based on caveats lodged between 1 Apr and 27 Jun this year, overall sales transaction volumes for private residential units decreased qoq by 10.3% in 2Q 2021. The transaction volumes for both the primary and secondary markets declined qoq, by 18.5% and 4.1% respectively. The volume of private home rental transactions decreased marginally qoq by 1.0% in 1Q 2021. Conversely, on a yoy basis, there was a growth of 9.0%, suggesting a relatively stable and robust private homes rental market despite the ongoing pandemic. 1Q 2021 23,622 units 4Q 2020 23,854 units 2Q 2021 (URA flash estimate) 163.7 1Q 2021 162.2 2Q 2021 (caveats between 1 Apr 21 and 27 Jun 21) 7,267 units 1Q 2021 8,100 units Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA * Residential launch data for 2Q 2021 are based on new launches in Apr 21 and May 21 only. 1Q 2021 50,906 units, 24,401 total unsold 4Q 2020 52,403 units, 27,437 total unsold 13 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH MARKET COMMENTARY MARKET OUTLOOK * Based on URA's flash estimate for 2Q 2021, the PPI for all private residential properties rose for the fifth consecutive quarter, albeit at a slower rate of 0.9% qoq versus 3.3% qoq in 1Q 2021. The PPI for non-landed private residential properties rose at a marginally faster rate than landed private residential properties. Across the various market segments for the non-landed properties, the price increase was most pronounced in the Outside Central Region (OCR), at 1.8% qoq as compared to 0.6% and 0.3% for the Core Central Region (CCR) and Rest of Central Region (RCR) respectively. This trend suggested strong demand for units in the OCR against the backdrop of prevailing decentralisation and work-from-home trends. * Based on caveats lodged between 1 Apr 21 and 27 Jun 21, new sales and secondary transaction volumes dipped qoq in 2Q 2021. New sales volume recorded a more significant decline of 18.5% qoq. Across the market segments, new sales volumes within the RCR and OCR witnessed qoq declines of 40.9% and 2.3% respectively. On the other hand, new sales volume in the CCR witnessed a qoq growth of 16.6%. * The growth in new sales volume in the CCR correlated with the location of the new residential launches of this year. There were nine significant launches of non- landed projects between the start of the year and end-May 2021, out of which five (Midtown Modern, The Atelier, Irwell Hill Residences, Peak Residence, and Grange 1866) were located in the CCR. * The residential pipeline supply and the total number of unsold units for 1Q 2021 have declined, respectively for the third and ninth consecutive quarters. Based on the current 3-year moving average of new units take- up per annum, it would take an estimated 2.6 years to clear up the unsold supply. The government is cognisant of the tightening of the residential pipeline, and has decided to moderately increase the supply of private housing through the 2H 2021 Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. * In the private residential leasing market, total rental volume declined marginally by 0.97% qoq to 23,622 transactions in 1Q 2021. However, there was a 9.0% yoy growth from 1Q 2020, suggesting a relatively stable rental market for private homes. * As the economy gradually recovers against the backdrop of local and global vaccination programmes, the demand for private homes will likely hold steady amidst a low interest rate environment with ample liquidity and optimistic market sentiments. * Barring possible imposition of policy measures to cool the market, the private homes market is likely to remain on sound footing with transaction activity staying robust. * A further boost could be due to the increasing number of prospective HDB upgraders coming off a buoyant HDB resale market. * On the supply side, developers could continue to price new units at a premium to account for increases in construction costs resultant from a tight foreign labour market and delayed timelines due to COVID-19. * We expect developers to continue striving for products incorporating new home and lifestyle concepts that support the new normal of work, live, and play. * We expect the mass rental market to see sustained demand from expatriates relocating from prime properties and foreign workers seeking temporary accommodation due to the ongoing border restrictions.

This will lift retailer and consumer sentiment and, in turn, drive retail sales and business expansion. Thus, vacancy rates could fall in the short-term and rent declinesshould ease further. Warehouse * Demand for logistics/warehouse space remained healthy in 2Q21, underpinned by requirements from third-party logistics players and e-commerce firms. There were also enquiries for cold-room or temperature-controlled facilities. * The islandwide average logistics/warehouse rent rose in 2Q21 after holding steady for the past four quarters, driven by relatively tight supply, especially for better quality logistics assets. * Strong competition for logistics/warehouse assets drove up the average logistics/warehouse capital value for the first time in more than three years, and compressed yields in 2Q21. * Given the weight of capital chasing logistics/warehouse assets amid an earlier-than-expected rent recovery, we expect capital values to continue heading north, while yields are foreseen to compress further.AuthorsTay Huey YingHead of Research & ConsultancySingaporeHueyying.tay@ap.jll.com Ong Teck HuiSenior Director, ResidentialResearchSingaporeTeckhui.ong@ap.jll.comAngelia PhuaDirector, RetailResearchSingaporeAngelia.phua@ap.jll.comDoreen Goh Director, IndustrialResearchSingaporeDoreen.goh@ap.jll.comMichelle TeeDirector, OfficeResearchSingaporeMichelle.tee@ap.jll.comJLL Singapore9 Raffles Place#39-00 Republic PlazaSingapore 048619tel +65 6220 3888fax +65 6438 3361jll.com.sg 121.7Current stock (sq ft million) 1.37Gross effective rent (SGD psf pm NLA) 1.5%Rental growth (q-o-q) 190Capital value(SGD psf NLA) 6.2%Capital value growth (q-o-q)BanditsAll data are reflective of the islandwide market 5.1Current stock (sq ft million) 35.24Gross effective rent (SGD psf pm NLA) -3.3%Rental growth (q-o-q) 8,343Capital value (SGD psf NLA) -0.5%Capital value growth (q-o-q)All data are reflective of the Prime sub-submarketjll.com.sgCEA Licence No. L3007326E(c) Copyright 2021JLL.

MANUFACTURING, LED BY SEMICONDUCTORS, POWERING SINGAPORE'S RECOVERY DA N I E L D I N G, H E A D, CAP I TAL MARKE TS (L A N D & B U I LD I N G ,I N TE RNATI ONAL RE AL E STATE & I N DU STRIA L) According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Singapore's economy grew 1.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q1 2021, a surprising turnaround from the negative 2.4% y-o-y contraction recorded in the last quarter of 2020. Manufacturing continued to drive Singapore's recovery, with output expansions in electronics, precision engineering and chemical clusters outweighing output declines in the transport engineering, general manufacturing, and biomedical manufacturing clusters. In particular, semiconductor manufacturers and sub-contractors supporting electronics firms were observed to be exploring expansion space to ramp up production in Q2 2021, especially so with the global chip shortage and overall increasing reliance on devices in the pandemic era. In May 2021, the Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) recorded an expansion of 50.7, representing the 11th consecutive month of expansion for the industrial sector. This was a dip of 0.2 from the previous two-year high of 50.9 reported in April 2021, and slight fall from the 50.8 reported at the end of Q1 2021. Nevertheless, the persistent expansion in the PMI serves as a reassuring indicator that the industrial sector will be in a state of continued growth throughout 2021. 1The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in April and May 2021 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against January and February 2021) and y-o-y (against April and May 2020).

In Q2 2021, the island-wide median rent of multiple-user factory space remained unchanged from the previous quarter at S$1.73 per square foot per month (psf pm) (Exhibit 1). Despite that, the monthly data suggested an improvement in both rents and rental activity, mirroring the trends seen in the manufacturing sector at large.

In May, BioNTech, the German biotechnology company responsible Vaccine giants set up shop in Singapore As a result, there was a total of 1,801 rental transactions in April and May, representing an increase of 43.7% y-o-y from the 1,253 rental transactions in the same period last year, and an increase of 15.2% from 1,564 transactions in January and February 2021. With an increasing urgency to fulfil orders from all over the world, producers of technological components were active in seeking expansion space in order to grow output. The multiple-user factory segment showed some brisk transactional activity totalling some S$370.0 million, led by the S$35.3 million sale of Lam Soon Industrial Building in May 2021.

Pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur announced in April plans to expand its footprint in Singapore with the development of a S$638 million vaccine production centre. Construction is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2021, with full operations beginning in 2026. The new facilities are in line with the government's plan to position Singapore as a regional hub for the healthcare and biotechnology industries. While the resurgence in COVID-19 cases at home and abroad has put a dampener on the recovery in the transport engineering cluster, the manufacturing sector continued to lead the recovery in 2021 as expected. According to the Economic Development Board (EDB), recent business sentiments in the manufacturing sector were positive, with manufacturing firms anticipating a favourable business situation for the second and third quarters of 2021. And as new reports indicate that the global chip shortage may be more protracted than previously anticipated, semiconductor manufacturers may be more sanguine in committing capital to expand production volumes, driving demand for industrial space. However, the considerable supply of new industrial space in the pipeline would likely keep industrial rent growth in check. About 56.1 million sf gross floor area (GFA) of new industrial space is expected to come online between Q2 2021 to end 2024, with 45.7% of the new supply projected to be completed in the rest of 2021. Although a significant proportion of the new supply consists of factory space, construction delays due to COVID-19 induced labour shortages and healthy pre-commitment levels for upcoming factory space may alleviate the impact on factory rentals, allowing rents to increase moderately between 1% and 3% for the whole of 2021.

This was largely attributed to the low base in Q2/2020 when large parts of the economy were shut to curb the spread of the pandemic. Compared with the preceding quarter, the economy contracted by 1.8% in Q2/2021, ending three consecutive quarters of growth since Q3/2020. The similar trend was also observed in the manufacturing sector. Although the sector extended its three- quarter expansion with a 17.7% YoY growth in Q2/2021, it nevertheless contracted by 2.5% from the previous quarter. This marked a signifi cant pullback from its 11.5% quarterly growth in Q1/2021. Nonetheless, Singapore's overall manufacturing sentiment remained buoyant in Q2/2021, with June's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) staying in expansionary territory for the 12th straight month (PMI: 50.8). Despite a slower rate of growth in May due to the impact of tighter COVID-19 measures on the sector, momentum in factory activity remained strong in Q2. In the same quarter, Singapore exports continued its growth trend from March. Coupled with the improving global economic backdrop and global demand for semiconductor-related products, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose at a faster pace of 15.9% in June. RENTAL MARKET Owing to the strong leasing interest for factory and warehouse spaces, the industrial leasing scene was more active in Q2/2021. Leasing volume1 was up 43.7% YoY to 3,381, far surpassing the quarterly average of around 2,400 transactions for the last fi ve years. From our focal group discussions with industrial market specialists, for factory space, it appears that more companies still prefer leasing to owning, especially the multinational corporations (MNCs). On the other hand, for warehousing space users, there is a mixed preference amongst users with sales and leasing demand evenly balanced. In Q2/2021, leases for multiple-user and single-user factories increased by 46.6% YoY and 43.0% YoY respectively, while that for warehouses went up by 30.3% YoY. Arising from strong leasing demand, vacancy rate of multiple-user factory fell 0.7 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.3% in Q2/2021, the lowest since Q3/2013. Despite an improvement in net demand, vacancy for single-user factory and warehouse segments remained relatively fl at from the previous quarter as new supply outpaced net demand. As the construction industry slowly overcome the delays caused by the 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). pandemic, more new completions come to the fore with some major projects such as Cogent Jurong Island Logistics Hub and Digital Loyang II data centre being completed in Q2. Consequently, this led to downward pressures on the overall occupancy level for the two segments. Industrial rents trended along with the demand across respective segments. While rents for multiple-user factories were recovering after a year of decline from Q4/2019, that for warehouses were starting to stabilise after rising for the last few quarters. In Q2/2021, JTC's rental index for multiple- user factories rose at a faster pace at 1.0% QoQ. Similarly, Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 increased by 1.4% QoQ to S$1.74 per sq ft in Q2, compared to the 1.1% QoQ increase in Q1. On the other hand, warehouse rental growth continued to slow in Q2, with JTC's rental indices inching up 0.2% QoQ. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, the average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics3 properties remained fl at at S$1.44 per sq ft. SALES MARKET Singapore's strata industrial market started to quieten down since early this year. Even though the total sales volume of 419 in Q2/2020 was signifi cantly more than 149 deals transacted in Q2/2020, the pace of sales growth slowed down in 1H/2021. Notably, number of sales caveats lodged for multiple- user factories declined from the peak in Q4/2020. Many industrialists, particularly the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs), are looking to acquire multiple-user factory spaces at a favourable price. Although some sellers are now more realistic with their price expectations, most buyers expect greater price reduction amid pandemic-led disruptions. As a result of a mismatch in price expectations, sellers rather keep the property for stable revenue income than to dispose at a huge price discount. For the warehouse segment, sales volume had remained stable since Q3/2020, the quarter when the number of deals surged after the economy unlocked a notch. There is still strong buying interest from both end-users and investors who are looking for industrial assets including logistics warehouse and cold storage facilities. Coupled with limited supply available in the market, investors see warehouse logistics as one of the attractive asset classes, which have a strong potential in the long run and appeal to users from various industries. 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.40 per sq ft.

Industrial prices in Q2/2021 continued to increase on the back of healthy sales level. From Savills' basket of industrial properties4, prices for freehold properties increased at a faster rate at 0.6% QoQ to S$705 per sq ft in Q2/2021. Savills' basket of leasehold industrial properties showed that prices for 60-year leasehold properties continued trending up with a 0.5% QoQ uptick to S$434 per sq ft, while that for 30-year leasehold properties ended a six-quarter decline with a 0.1% QoQ growth to S$292 per sq ft. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL The take-up for business park space was uneven across locations in Q2/2021. Notably, occupier demand in older clusters such as Changi Business Park remained weak, driving the vacancy level in East Planning Region up by 1.0 ppt QoQ to a record high of 18.7%. Even though the net take-up in prime areas remained at healthy levels, the vacancy level in the Central Planning Region (where the more sought-after Business Parks are located) inched up by 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 10.9%, the highest since Q4/2018. This was attributed to the recent completions in one-north, including Razer SEA HQ and Wilmar International, which are likely not fully physically occupied yet. As the overall rental growth for business parks were limited by the subdued demand in the older clusters, JTC's rental index for business park stayed fl at in Q2/2021. This was in line with the direction for average monthly rent in Savills' basket of prime business park properties5 and standard business park properties6. 4 Only include upper-storey strata-titled factory (single- and multiple-user factory) and warehouse units, excluding all ground fl oor units. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. They remained unchanged at S$5.76 per sq ft and inched up by 0.1% QoQ to S$3.97 per sq ft respectively. In Q2/2021, the occupier demand for high-spec industrial segment showed some signs of picking up and this could be one of the factors supporting the occupancy level of multiple-user factories (high-spec industrial buildings are a subset of multiple-user factories). Landlords of high-spec industrial space continued to see leasing interest from fi ntech fi rms, new IT start-up companies and creative agencies. However, as prospective tenants are still quite cost conscious, well-maintained older developments are competitors to these buildings. Consequently, landlords have been unable to raise their rents too much as prospective tenants are price sensitive and substitute spaces are available. As such, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket7 remained rather fl at with a -0.1% QoQ growth to S$3.48 per sq ft in Q2/2021. OUTLOOK Unlike the other sectors of the property market, the industrial and warehousing sectors have been performing in synch with exigencies that came about due to the pandemic. While the landscape for the other sectors of the market have been evolving 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. since the start of the pandemic, the industrial and warehousing market has in fact maintained a consistent storyline, one that is intuitive in nature and thus extrapolatable. After almost eighteen months since the inception of measures to contain the pandemic, the common themes that have been dominating the industrial and warehousing market have been supply chain disruptions and new economy demand. We have supply chain disruptions and the increased demand for healthcare related equipment driving the demand for logistics space. We also have new economy companies spearheading demand for business park and high-spec industrial space together with such companies that serve the online consumer market on the lookout for logistics space. These have been described in our Q1/2021 briefi ng and its currency still holds. The additional observation for the second quarter is that buyers have actively been looking for deals but sellers, especially those on 30- year land leases, though having lowered their price expectations are not willing to go down further to consummate a sale. In view of the recovery in the multiple-user factory market, we have revised our rental forecast from -3% to 0% to 2.5%. For warehouse and logistics space, we maintain our 1% to 3% forecast range.
