Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Sustained Economic Growth into 2022 According to advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Singapore's economy grew 7.2% for the whole of 2021. The economy witnessed a strong rebound last year after 2020's record 5.4% contraction. Full-year 2021 manufacturing growth reached 12.8%, extending the 7.3% expansion in the preceding year. Singapore's economic expansion is expected to slow to about 4% in 2022. Nonetheless, 2022 expected growth would still indicate a solid economic recovery as it remains above pre-Covid-19 trend levels of about 3.1% GDP growth. New Economy Assets Outperform Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, there were steady increases in rents during 2021 for various types of industrial properties, except for outlying business park and factory space. Prime logistics and high-tech properties were the star performers, enjoying highest rental growth of more than 2% for the whole of 2021, bolstered by digital transformation and e-commerce adoption and outperformance of high-value manufacturing sectors such as biomedical and electronics. Rents of factories remained stable last year on the back of relatively tight vacancy rates, in line with Singapore's economic recovery. While city fringe business park experienced stable growth, rents of outlying business parks were weighed down by lower rents at older projects during the year. Nonetheless, outlying business park rents appeared to be bottoming out, inching up marginally by 0.1% qoq in Q4 2021 after several quarters of declines. Broad-based Growth in 2022 Positive outlook is expected for industrial rents across different segments. Rents for business parks in the city fringe are expected to continue rising while rents of outlying business parks could start recovering this year amidst ongoing economic recovery and newer business park space expected to come into the market in 2022. Similarly, demand for high-tech, prime logistics and warehouse spaces are likely to stay healthy given continued expansion from companies in pharmaceuticals, life science, technological and logistics sectors, fueled by the exponential growth in e-commerce and business digitalization. However, performance will be differentiated depending on their specifications. Newer and higher spec developments that are able to better meet evolving end-user requirements would lead growth while older warehouse stock would likely see stagnant rents. As such, we could see a slew of redevelopments to meet the needs of quality and higher specifications' demand. Occupancy rates of factory space could come under pressure in 2022 due to substantial upcoming supply in the pipeline. While majority of factory stock coming onstream in 2022 are single-user factory, which are already pre-committed, multi-user factory new supply is set to increase substantially in 2022 as compared to that 2021, based on latest JTC data as of Q3 2021. Nonetheless, demand for factories would be supported by continued outperformance in the biomedical, electronics and related industries and ongoing improvements in the general manufacturing landscape as the economy continues to recover into 2022. As such, overall factory rents could rise in 2022.

However, full yoy growth stood at 7.2% in 2021, the highest since 2010. * The manufacturing sector expanded by 14.0% yoy in Q4 2021, accelerating from the 7.9% growth recorded in the previous quarter. The services sector contracted by 4.6% yoy in Q4 2021, compared to a growth of 6.2% in Q3 2021. * Singapore attracted $3.7bn in FAI in Q3 2021, an increase from $3.6bn in Q2 2021 with the electronics sector leading at around $3.4bn. * MAS kept its inflation outlook unchanged on 25 October 2021. Singapore's core inflation for 2021 will likely come near the upper end of its 0 - 1% forecast and increase to 1 - 2% in 2022. Overall inflation is forecast to come in around 2% in 2021 and average 1.5 - 2.5% in 2022. * The labour market continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate declined marginally to 2.6% in Q3 2021 from 2.7% in Q2 2021. In Q3 2021, total employment contracted by 8,400, with construction (-6,600), food and beverage services (-2,100) and other service industries (-6,400) bearing the brunt. On the other hand, the information and communications (+4,000), and professional services (+2,500) and administrative and support (+2,000) recorded employment growth. * The road ahead is expected to remain uneven for various sectors of the economy. In particular, manufacturing and wholesale trade are expected to remain resilient due to external demand, although slowing Chinese growth does pose a key risk. The recovery for the aviation and tourism industry is also expected to slow due to the fresh Omicron threat. * With the country's high vaccination rate and the rapid rollout of booster shots for a wider age group, industries in the service line such as hospitality and food and beverage industry should benefit from an uplift in sentiment and easing restrictions. * On 24th November 2021, MTI announced that Singapore's GDP growth forecast for 2022 will be within the range of \"3.0% to 5.0%\" as more industries resume their activities progressively. As Singapore reconnects increasingly with the world and with the easing of borders, new areas of growth can be expected in terms of ramping up digitalisation and moving towards a greener economy. However, time is required to meet the manpower shortages in various industries, particularly the construction sector.

In addition, the transactions for office sales were predominantly strata-titled transactions. * The collective sale market registered strong activity with a consecutive string of sites launched for sale. A total of six deals were sealed in the quarter, of which three of them constituted part of the top five private investment deals. * The largest deal in the year was the acquisition of One George Street, a 23-storey office building, by a joint venture between JPMorgan Global Alternatives and Nuveen Real Estate for $1.3bn from CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust and FWD Group. The transaction was completed in December. * A joint venture between Hoi Hup Realty and Sunway Developments was awarded two freehold land parcels at Thiam Siew Avenue for $815mn via a public tender exercise. It was the largest residential development site sold since the previous round of property cooling measures implemented in July 2018. * Peace Centre and Peace Mansion, a mixed-use development, was sold via private treaty to a joint venture between Chip Eng Seng, SingHaiyi Crystal, and Ultra Infinity for $650mn. It was launched for collective sale in September. * Located at Shelford Road, Watten Estate Condominium was jointly sold to UOL Group and Singapore Land Group for $550.8mil via collective sale in its third attempt. * RESIDENTIAL: The demand for Good Class Bungalows (GCB) is expected to remain strong, though transaction sale volume may ease due to limited available listings. Given the fresh property cooling measures, developers will be subjected to a higher additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) rate of 35 per cent (including 5 per cent non-remittable) and are likely to adopt a more cautious approach towards their land bids. However, amid the tight unsold inventory of private housing units, developers may continue to turn towards the collective sale market to stock up on their land banks. * RETAIL: Amid the uncertainty brought about by the emergence of the Omicron variant and current restrictive safe management measures, investor sentiment in the retail market remains cautious. Prime retail assets are also tightly held, limiting transaction activity. * OFFICE: With the gradual resumption of the workforce back to the office, starting with 50 per cent from 1 January 2022, demand for high quality and green spaces will rise to suit occupiers' evolving requirements. The office market rental recovery has supported investment activity, which is expected to continue in 2022 amid tight supply and companies' realignment of workplace space strategies. * INDUSTRIAL: Industrial assets are anticipated to remain attractive to investors due to the sector's resilient performance and its growing importance accentuated by the pandemic. Amid rising environmental concerns, more investors will place their environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda at the forefront of investment decision-making efforts. 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH OFFICE - Quality office spaces fuel rental growth 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2021 2022 2023 2024 Under Construction mn sq KEY HIGHLIGHTS Average monthly gross rents (SGD/sq ft) SUPPLY - Singapore OFFICE SUPPLY (sq ft) OFFICE SUPPLY PIPELINE ( Q4 2021-2024) (sq ft) At Q3 2021, nearly 3.9mn sq ft of new office space will be completed from Q4 2021 to 2024, down from 4.6mn as of Q2 2021.

Prime office spaces in the central region experienced a positive uptick in leasing demand in the fourth quarter as companies prepared to work from the office in the new year. The occupancy rate for office spaces in the CBD rose by 0.7% to 93.0% in 4Q 2021. Amid flight to quality, Premium and Grade A CBD rents fell marginally by 0.1% in 2021 although overall CBD rents fell by 3.6%. CBD occupancy rate fell marginally by 0.1% last year; the market was weighed down in the first half of the year before sentiment stabilised. * With an improved business confidence in 2H 2021 technology companies and the financial sector, in particular the wealth management sector and family offices, continued to expand their office footprint and drive leasing demand. Additionally, with Singapore being a safe haven for global investors and international firms, companies are setting up offices locally in anticipation of a reopening of the workplace. * Another driver for prime office demand is derived from displaced tenants of Grade B office buildings, who are looking to upgrade to Grade A office buildings. With anticipation for employees to return to the office in 2022, employers are finding the right ways to entice employees to work from the physical office to enhance the company culture and drive innovation. * Some examples of leasing demand for the quarter are Shopee who is expanding their office into Rochester Commons, PGIM's relocation from One Raffles Place to CapitaSpring, Gojek shifting from AXA Tower to Suntec Tower 5 and Twitter's expansion into CapitaSpring from their current office located at CapitaGreen. * Moving into 2022, we expect flexibility to be the key theme for the office sector. Flexibility for employees working in the office and companies adopting a hybrid work approach in the long haul, as well as flexibility for tenants as they prefer more flexible lease options. Some companies may gravitate towards incorporating co- working spaces for the employees as an added amenity. * With office employment improving, companies are also looking to rethink and redesign their office space for current and future employees. Information and communications sector employment has experienced the most growth, followed by financial and insurance services. As the labour market for office employment gradually improves, the government has also been pushing to upskill workers to meet the market demands. * With Singapore progressing along with its Covid-19 endemic road map, we expect leasing demand to pick up further. In line with the changing preferences of occupiers, traditional office spaces are evolving to facilitate and encourage collaboration and brainstorming of ideas. * We expect a positive net absorption for 2022, with rental growth of likely 3% to 5% for good quality office buildings as demand continues to strengthen. We expect companies to acknowledge the importance of well-designed quality workspaces in facilitating business networking, employee collaboration and fostering company culture. With the redevelopment of older office stock and a tight supply pipeline in the year, vacancy is expected to fall, and office rents are expected to rise, led by the prime segment. 8 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL - Optimism for 2022 held back by Omicron 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 First-storey multiple-user factory Upper-storey multiple-user factory $ psf 70 80 90 100 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Single-user factory Multiple-user factory Business park Warehouse % KEY HIGHLIGHTS RENTAL OF FIRST STOREY MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY OCCUPANCY RATE OF MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY F i r m p r o s p e c t s f o r t h e manufacturing sector drove the slight 0.5% qoq increase in rent.

The overall manufacturing sector has now recorded the 18th month of expansion, albeit slowing growth amid concerns over the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and disruptions to supply chains. * On a 3-month moving average yoy basis, NODX grew by 17.9% yoy in November 2021, following a 10.5% rise in October 2021. Both electronics and non-electronics grew. * Overall industrial net absorption decreased from 3.9mn sq ft in Q2 2021 to 2.4mn sq ft in Q3 2021. possibly due to uncertainties surrounding global trade markets and concerns about cost escalation from fuel, transport, materials and labour amid disruptions from Covid-19. The drivers were multiple-user factory segment (1.1mn sq ft), warehouse segment (0.6mn sq ft), business park segment (0.4mn sq ft) and single- user factory segment (0.3mn sq ft). * Island-wide, the occupancy rate for warehouse increased 0.4% qoq to 90.1% in Q3 2021, whilst that of the multiple-user factory increased 0.1% qoq to 89.8% in Q3 2021. The rest of the occupancy rates for other industrial segments decreased, with business parks declining the most at 0.5% qoq to 84.3% in Q3 2021. * As of Q3 2021, approximately 27% of the supply pipeline will be completed in 2021, followed by 33% in 2022. Multiple-user factories accounted for the bulk (35%) of the supply pipeline with approximately 12.2mn sq ft NLA. Single-user factory space made up 29% of the supply pipeline, projected to be about 10.3mn sq ft NLA. * Amid robust manufacturing activity in Q4 2021, multiple-user factory rents rose by 0.2-0.5% qoq in the quarter. Buoyant demand for spaces with modern specifications pushed up rents by 0.5% qoq for hi-tech spaces in Q4 2021. For the full year, rents of hi-tech spaces rose by 2.7%, while multiple-user (ground floor) factory rents rose by 1.9%. On the other hand, upper storey factory rents fell by 0.3%. * Looking ahead, while the prospects for the industrial sector remain robust and intact, especially for high-specification logistics and factory spaces, the significant supply pipeline and other ongoing economic and business risks will cap the strength of the recovery. As major global economies prepare to embark on policy normalization, coupled with slowing China's growth and global supply chain bottlenecks, trade momentum could slow in the coming months. Businesses are thus expected to be cautious with their space requirements. However, we see firm expansion from firms in certain clusters such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, precision engineering and logistics. * Supported by Industry 4.0 and the e-commerce avalanche, new-economy assets such as logistics warehouses, high-specs industrial properties and business parks will continue to feature steady investment activity and fuel potential price growth in the near term. * Rents of industrial space are likely to grow between 2-3% for multiple-user factory space in 2022, while hi-tech factory and warehouse spaces will likely see higher rental growth of 3-5%. Even as demand prospects improve, the sizeable supply pipeline will cap the upside of rental growth. * Even as global Covid-19 vaccination rates increase and businesses continue to reopen, global growth is expected to soften for 2022. Furthermore, the spread of omicron infections may prove to be a wildcard going forward. On balance, the positive outlook for the industrial sector is tempered by some downside risks. 10 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH SUPPLY OF RETAIL SPACES (2021-2024) (sq ft) The i12 Katong mall has started to open progressively from Q4 2021, where six levels of retail shops will consist of about 180 stores.

The occupancy rate improved marginally by 0.4% to 91.9% in Q3 2021. In 2021, the occupancy rate grew by 1.5% points, mainly uplifted by the growth in the Fringe/Suburban Area. Rent for Fringe/suburban rose by 2.6% for the year, compared to a marginal growth of 0.1% in Orchard/Scotts Road and a fall in rental rates of 1.2% in Other City Areas. * The occupancy rate for the Fringe/ Suburban Area improved by 0.2% points to 93.8% in Q3 2021, the fifth quarter of consecutive increase since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. * Retail openings in Q4 2021 include GoldHeart at Causeway Point, Tsui Wah at The Heeren, Yakiniku Like at Sengkang Compass One and Don Don Donki opening at Tampines Mall. Retail closures include Omakase Burger closing all their outlets in Singapore, Food Junction at Bugis Junction and Ben's cookies at Wisma Atria. * The 3-month moving average of yoy change in retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) has fallen from 7.5% in August 2021 to 8.0% in November 2021. Retail sales for Petrol Service Stations, Computer & Telecommunications Equipment and Watches & Jewellery experienced the greatest improvement yoy in 3Q 2021. The majority of the retail trade categories experienced a positive growth except for Optical Goods & Books, Others and Departmental stores which are the top three categories that experienced losses. * For the food and beverage services index for Q3 2021, Restaurants reported the highest decline of 16.8% yoy, due to the dining restrictions. Fast food outlets recorded the most improvement increasing by 12.6% yoy in Q3 2021 followed by Cafes, Food Courts & Other Eating Places which rose by 5.7% yoy. * Northshore Plaza I, located in the Punggol Northshore district, has also opened. The new development features a supermarket, eateries, shops, childcare centre and enrichment centres to cater to the needs of residents in the area. * We expect suburban malls to continue their outperforming pace in 2022. With their curated tenant mix over the years, the malls are able to cater to the needs of the residential catchment, catering to the daily needs, which further encourage them to patronise the malls. As Covid gains acceptance as endemic within the community, retail sentiment will improve further and we expect stabilisation in the retail sector in 2022. Suburban retail rents will lead the recovery with around 5% to 10% of rental growth, while prime rents in OCR and OCA are also poised for a recovery in 2022. * D e s p i t e t h e p a n d e m i c , s o m e international brands are still looking for opportunities to expand their presence in the Singapore market, particularly F&B brands. Local brands, such as By Invite Only, The Editors Market and Bynd Artisan, have also expanded their retail footprint despite the pandemic. * Digitalisation, adoption of an omni channel approach and experimental retail are key trends going into 2022 for the retail sector. Retailers will continue to reinvent themselves and build their online presence, allowing their online and physical storefronts to complement each other. Malls will also continue to adjust their tenant mix, including securing unique and well-known international brands to entice more customers and increase footfall and spending in the malls. 12 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Q1 2011 Q3 2011 Q1 2012 Q3 2012 Q1 2013 Q3 2013 Q1 2014 Q3 2014 Q1 2015 Q3 2015 Q1 2016 Q3 2016 Q1 2017 Q3 2017 Q1 2018 Q3 2018 Q1 2019 Q3 2019 Q1 2020 Q3 2020 Q1 2021 Q3 2021 Residential pipeline Total unsold Years to clear unsold based on 3-year moving average for new sales per annum (RHS) Years '000 units 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 100,000 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Units RESIDENTIAL - Upward trajectory of demand and price attesting to resilience of the private residential sector 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 Q1 2011 Q3 2011 Q1 2012 Q3 2012 Q1 2013 Q3 2013 Q1 2014 Q3 2014 Q1 2015 Q3 2015 Q1 2016 Q3 2016 Q1 2017 Q3 2017 Q1 2018 Q3 2018 Q1 2019 Q3 2019 Q1 2020 Q3 2020 Q1 2021 Q3 2021 All Residential Price Index Landed Non-landed 1Q 2009 = 100 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 Q1 2011 Q1 2012 Q1 2013 Q1 2014 Q1 2015 Q1 2016 Q1 2017 Q1 2018 Q1 2019 Q1 2020 Q1 2021 Primary sales Secondary sales Residential launches* Units KEY HIGHLIGHTS PROPERTY PRICE INDEX OF ALL PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES RESIDENTIAL PIPELINE SUPPLY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SALES TRANSACTION VOLUME PRIVATE HOME RENTAL TRANSACTIONS In Q4 2021, based on URA's flash estimate, the overall Property Price Index (PPI) for private residential properties rose for the seventh consecutive quarter by 5% qoq. This rise can be attributed to a 5.4% qoq increase in the PPI for non-landed private properties and a 3.7% qoq increase for the landed private properties. The pipeline supply for private homes remained relatively unchanged, with a marginal decline of 0.6% qoq in Q3 2021. The total number of unsold units contracted by 11.6% qoq and we expect the units to be absorbed in 1.7 years (previously 2.0 years). Based on caveats lodged between 1 Oct 2021 and 31 Dec 2021, overall sales transaction volumes for private residential units decreased qoq by 9.3% in Q4 2021. The transaction volumes for both the primary and secondary markets declined qoq, by 15% and 4.7% respectively. The number of private rental transactions grew significantly by 11.9% qoq in Q3 2021, driven by the continual ongoing uncertainties within the construction sector, which created demand for rental units. On a yoy basis, rental transactions remained relatively similar with a total of 26,969 private rental transactions in Q3 2020. Q3 2021 26,759 units Q2 2021 23,923 units Q4 2021 (URA flash estimate) 173.6 Q3 2021 165.3 Q4 2021 7,377 units Q3 2021 8,973 units Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA * Residential launch data for Q4 2021 is based on new launches in Oct 2021 and Nov 2021 only.

Prices for the landed properties grew by 3.7%, while the non-landed prices by 5.4%. * Based on caveats lodged, new sales and secondary transaction volumes dipped 15% and 4.7% qoq respectively in 4Q 2021. Across the market segments, new sales volumes within the OCR witnessed decline of 50% qoq due to a sharp decline in launched units, while new sales volume in the CCR and RCR recorded qoq growth of 35.0% and 37.0% respectively. On the other hand, secondary sales volume recorded a more uniform decline of about 16.0% - 20.0% qoq across all segments in 4Q 2021. * Despite the dropped in sale volume, prices continued to climb. The price increase was observed across all segments in Q4 2021, with RCR registering the highest qoq price growth of 7.3%, while CCR and OCR saw an increase of 2.5% and 5.4% respectively. The RCR price growth was attributable to the robust sale of CanningHill Piers at an average price of $2,937 psf. * There were 4 new non-landed project launches, namely Cairnhill 16 (CCR), Perfect Ten (CCR), CanningHill Piers (RCR) and The Commodore (OCR). The robust take-up rate of 82.8% for CanningHill Piers attested to demand for RCR properties while nearly 75% take-up rate for The Commodore indicated the continual interest for homes in the suburbs. In contrast, Perfect Ten sold only 12 out of 230 units, as it was launched in the immediate aftermath of the 16 December cooling measures. * The pipeline supply for private residential homes as of Q3 2021 fell by 0.6% qoq to 52,101 units. Likewise, the total number of unsold units for Q3 2021 dropped by 11.6% qoq to a record low of 17,165 units for the period commencing from Q4 2017. Based on the last four quarters' sales pace of new units, it would take just 1.7 years to absorb the unsold supply, attesting to the tight inventory situation. * Non-landed rental transactions grew by 11.9% qoq to 26,759 transactions in Q3 2021. The growth in rental volume was likely fuelled by delays in the completion of the properties arising from the supply chain disruption, coupled with the return of expatriates/ students via the vaccinated travel lanes (VTL). The growth across all the market segments was broad- based, roughly 11.2% to 12.4% qoq in Q3 2021. * The strong sales momentum from Q3 2021 initially continued into the first two months of Q4 2021 but slowed in December on the back of the cooling measures and a limited number of new project launches. * With the imposition of the latest cooling measures to promote housing affordability and curb market exuberance, price growth is expected to moderate. However, we do not expect strong pressures on developers to reduce prices, especially for projects with limited unsold inventory. * Looking ahead, the tightening of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) could divert some demand towards suburban homes which are more affordable. We also expect some rotation of demand from RCR to OCR in 2022, given the strong price increases in RCR in 2021. * Demand will continue to be largely supported by local first-time home buyers and HDB upgraders, who are least impacted by the cooling measures. Stable economic prospects and an improving job market in 2022 will further support the demand for private homes. * However, sales momentum is expected to slow on the back of fewer units from new launches in 2022. Developers will likely exercise more caution in bidding for land parcels over the next few months. We expect a recovery in launch and sales activity in 2H 2022 if the collective sales market stabilises. * While the cooling measures will dampen sales momentum, the overall market remains supported by a robust labour market, ongoing economic growth, and healthy demand-supply dynamics in the property market. The nation is also better prepared to face new Covid challenges, given the high vaccination rates and booster programme. Our base projection is for a slight correction of primary sales to about 11,000 - 12,000 units for 2022. * 2022 will be a robust year for the rental market. With the VTL and resumption of air travel bringing more expatriates, foreign workers and students back to Singapore, we foresee rental demand to strengthen further in 2022.

The manufacturing sector posted a growth of 12.8% y-o-y, led by output expansions in all clusters, particularly electronics and precision engineering. The precision engineering cluster, being one of the critical industries that boost growth in the domestic manufacturing industry, provides components to a variety of businesses ranging from semiconductor to marine and offshore as well as medical technology. The government launched a three-stage digital roadmap known as the Precision Engineering Industry Digital Plan (IDP) to aid firms in the sector in identifying digital solutions to be adopted at each stage of business growth in order to thrive in an increasingly-digitalised world. In December, the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered a slight increase of 0.1 point from November to record an expansion of 50.7, marking the 18th straight month of expansion, albeit at a moderate pace as manufacturers remained wary of production and logistics disruptions arising from the Omicron variant. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in October and November 2021 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against July and August 2021) and y-o-y (against October and November 2020). In the fourth quarter, the island-wide median rent of multiple-user factory space increased by 1.6% q-o-q to S$1.79 psf pm, posting a continued q-o-q uptick in rental growth from Q3 (Exhibit 1). However, rental activity declined slightly as the months of October and November registered a total of 1,628 tenancies, 10% lower than the 1,809 rental transactions recorded in July and August 2021. On a y-o-y basis, this was nonetheless 4.2% higher than the 1,562 tenancies signed in the same period last year. In light of the expanding small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in Singapore, many have been on a lookout for affordable industrial spaces to locate their facilities. As such, this steady demand contributed to the increasing proportion of transactions valued at less than S$10 million. In Q4, out of the total 312 multiple-user factory caveats lodged at an average price of S$459 psf as at 31 December 2021, about 99.4% of them were of smaller- sized deals that are characteristically more palatable for this group.

Market outlook Singapore remains a key location for post-pandemic manufacturing Nor Adila Rahim Senior Analyst Research +65 6228 6856 nor.adila@sg.knightfrank.com Recent Publications INDUSTRIAL Q3 2021 SINGAPORE VIEW 24TH EDITION The global pandemic has changed the nature of various human and economic activities with a greater reliance on emerging technology coupled with an emphasis on sustainability and the environment. As new products have been borne out of the COVID-19 crisis stimulating the industrial sector, Singapore remains at the forefront of this evolution with investment from multinational manufacturers. American life sciences company Labcorp launched a new bioanalytical lab facility as an expansion of its central laboratory services in Jurong East, contributing to the capabilities of Singapore's biomedical ecosystem. Besides Labcorp, Thermo Fisher Scientific, BioNTech, Sanofi and GSK also announced investments in Singapore in the past two years. German multinational Siltronic broke ground on a new S$3 billion wafer manufacturing facility at JTC's Tampines Wafer Fab Park. This is its biggest investment in its history and its second 300mm fab in Singapore. The manufacturing sector led Singapore's economic recovery in 2021 as precision engineering supported growth in multiple downstream clusters such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, together with the electronics sector ramping up output due to the global chip shortage. Should overall recovery and health measures stay on the current trajectory of transitioning into a new norm, then barring any recurring waves of infections or new variants, the transport engineering sector might also turn a corner in 2022 as more borders open and travel volume improves. In the upcoming year, some 21.1 million sf GFA of new space is projected to come on stream across 2022, comprising 42.6% of the total stock set to be completed from Q4 2021 to 2025. As such, Knight Frank envisages growth in the industrial sector to continue in 2022, with investment activity likely to be driven by end-users looking for manufacturing facilities for their own use as well as Grade A warehouses that boast high-quality specifications which facilitate growing supply chain demand. The healthy demand and expanding activity in the sector will support rent and price increases of between 3% and 5% for the whole of 2022."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This led to a 7.6% YoY economic growth for the whole of 2021, showing a strong rebound from the 4.1% contraction in 2020. While the services producing industries grew by 5.6% YoY in 2021, the overall economic growth was led by the recovery (13.4% YoY) in the goods producing industries. The construction industry saw a robust expansion of 20.1% YoY while the manufacturing grew signifi cantly by 13.2% YoY. Singapore manufacturing sentiment ended 2021 on a positive note amid improving global economic conditions. Manufacturing activity grew for the 18th straight month in December, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inching up 0.1 point to 50.7. Singapore's key exports also continued growing for the 13th straight month in December, albeit at a slower rate than the previous month. Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose 18.4% YoY on the back of healthy demand for electronic products and pharmaceuticals. RENTAL MARKET The quarterly leasing volume1 continued to increase, rising by 4.9% YoY to 3,055 transactions in Q4. This brings total annual leasing volume to record level at 13,081, 18.8% higher than that in 2020. It was mainly lifted by strong leasing demand for single-user factory space which almost doubled from a year ago (+49.3%). This was largely driven by Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the electronics, manufacturing, and pharmaceutical industries, which require larger facilities for their business operations. The multiple-user factory and warehouse segments also saw healthy take- up from digital and creative businesses, as well as ecommerce and third-party logistics (3PL) companies. Compared with 2020 when leasing demand was largely driven by shorter leases to accommodate the surge in stockpiling, demand was more stable in 2021 as more industrialists committed to longer leases amid improving business sentiment. The vacancy rate for single-user factory and warehouse remained relatively stable in Q4, inching up by 0.1 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 9.4% and 10.0% respectively. With removal of 178,900 sq ft of stock, the vacancy rate for multiple-user factory eased by 0.4 of a ppt QoQ to 9.8% in Q4. Rents continued to trend up across all industrial segments in Q4, with JTC's rental index for factory and warehouse hitting a record since 2017. The Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). factories2 increased by 3.7% QoQ to S$1.84 per sq ft in Q4, which is 8.1% higher than a year ago. Savills' average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics properties3 also rose at a faster pace by 1.2% QoQ to S$1.46 per sq ft in Q4. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 remained relatively stable at 501 transactions in Q4, compared to 506 in Q3. This brings the total number of caveats to 1,922 for the whole of 2021, 52.1% higher than the previous year. This marked the the highest volume recorded since 2013. While most Multinational Corporations (MNCs) adopt an asset-light business model, many local SMEs were looking to acquire properties for their own operations. This helped to boost the demand for multiple-user factory and warehouses, especially from companies in the electronics, manufacturing, pharmaceutical distribution, ecommerce, and last mile transportation services. Although there was a gap between buyers and sellers' price expectations, buyers who need new facility with required specifi cations for their business operations were more motivated to commit to higher asking prices. Although there was some new project launches in Q4/2021, such as In Space and Citrine Foodland, industrial property prices continued to rise. In particular, the Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for freehold properties increased at a faster pace at 1.5% QoQ to S$721 per sq ft in Q4. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, the price of 60-year leasehold units rose by 1.1% QoQ to S$443 per sq ft. Savills' basket of 30-year leasehold industrial properties also showed a more signifi cant price increase in Q4, rising 0.8% QoQ to S$295 per sq ft. However, 30-year leasehold industrial prices are still 1.6% lower than a year ago. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL The vacancy level for business park space in the East Planning Region increased by 2.9 ppts QoQ in Q4/2021 to 21.5% largely due to reduced occupational pressures in ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee and Changi Business Park. Despite the completion of asset enhancement work for some buildings, it is nevertheless still challenging fi nding tenants.

Nonetheless, vacancy level in the Central Region eased by 1.7% ppt QoQ to record low at 8.5% due to stock removal for redevelopment of 1 Science Park Drive, bringing the islandwide vacancy level down 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 15.5% in Q4. The limited availability of space and constant demand in Mapletree Business City and one- north regions continued to support rental growth, driving Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents up by 0.9% QoQ to S$5.86 per sq ft in Q4, 0.8% above that a year ago. Savills' standard business park properties' monthly rents remained in recovery mode, rising by 0.4% QoQ to S$4.01 per sq ft in Q4, the same rental level as a year ago. However, the rental growth could be attributed to the REIT-owned properties which held their rents up while off ering other incentives such as Capital Expenditure (CapEx) allowance or rent- free period. While there was some spill-over of demand from high-spec industrial spaces to Grade B offi ces, some new high-spec industrial developments such as UBIX saw healthy commitment rate. Coupled with the strong demand in some prime high-spec industrial developments, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket increased by 0.7% QoQ to S$3.56 per sq ft in Q4, albeit at a moderated pace compared with the 1.7% QoQ rate achieved in Q3. OUTLOOK Singapore was set for an economic recovery in the beginning of the year, largely driven by the manufacturing sector. However, elevated oil and energy prices caused by Russia's attack on Ukraine are expected to have an impact on the electricity 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. temperature-controlled facilities. This is fuelled by manufacturers gearing up for a post-pandemic future where supply chains will have to be increasingly nimble. Notably, due to the pivot to Industry 4.0, landlords of older developments are likely to take the opportunity to embark on asset enhancement initiatives and redevelopment works to remain relevant. Nonetheless, the supply of modern industrial facilities with quality specifi cations is expected to remain limited in the near term because of construction delays. If infl ation, which was already high, catalysed by supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, gets further boosted by the Ukrainian confl ict, it may spur companies to purchase their own properties or sign long term leases. Although the prospect of stagfl ation may set in, the situation we have now could create the conditions for industrial/warehousing rents and prices to rise despite the economy not performing well. Taking the abovementioned factors into account, rent for prime multiple-user factory and warehouse & logistics properties is forecast to grow by up to 2% and 3% respectively in 2022.

The Russia-Ukraine confl ict will further strain global manufacturing and supply chains as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of commodities such as wheat, nickel and palladium. This could in turn lead to another wave of disruption and stockpiling. A protracted confl ict will aff ect business confi dence and weigh on global economies and impact their recovery from the pandemic. Despite the global headwinds, industrial and logistics are likely to remain as a favoured real estate sector. In light of operational constraints amid the pandemic, many businesses intensifi ed their eff orts to embrace advanced manufacturing, adopt new technology and upskill their workforce. Some initiatives to address the accelerated structural shifts resulting from COVID-19 include the digitalisation of warehousing operations and automation of production lines to cope with fl uctuations in demand.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast A better-than-expected economic performance Singapore's economy grew by 14.7% yoy in Q2 2021, much faster than the 1.5% growth in the previous quarter. Growth was continuingly led by manufacturing sector that expanded by 17.7% yoy in Q2 2021. Overall unemployment rate has also improved, coming down from 3% for the whole of 2020 to 2.9% in Q1 2021 and 2.7% in Q2 2021. Amidst a strong global economic recovery and accelerated vaccination programmes in key advanced economies, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on 11 August 2021 upgraded its GDP growth forecast range for 2021 to 6%- 7% from 4%-6% previously forecasted. Rents remained stable across most segments Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, rents of city fringe business park, prime logistics, warehouse and factory space remained stable in Q3 2021 as vacancy rates stayed tight alongside economic recovery. Science Park rents ($4.27 psf/mth) registered a rise of 0.5% qoq, extending the growth in the previous quarter. Similarly, high-tech rents continued to increase by 0.3% qoq in Q3 2021. COVID-19 could have accelerated the digital adoption by manufacturers and industrialists. This coupled with the government's push towards advanced manufacturing activities has supported demand for higher specification industrial developments. On the other hand, outlying business park rents ($3.54 psf/mth) fell by 0.9% qoq, weighed down by lower rents achieved by older developments. Nonetheless, the rates of rental decline have been moderated for the past two quarters of 2021 as compared to that in 2020, indicating that rents of outlying business park are likely to bottom out soon amid relatively limited supply of new business park space. Recovery is well underway Rental growth registered across different types of industrial properties in the first nine months of 2021 has reflected the expansion seen in the manufacturing sector - a key pillar of Singapore's economy. The ongoing global chip shortage could lead to semiconductor manufacturers being more confident in committing capital to increase production volumes, increasing demand for factory space. Increased flow of biotechnology investments into Singapore as well as possible expansion from technology and logistics firms, which have been riding well on the exponential growth in e-commerce and business digitalization, could drive up demand for high-tech and prime logistics space. In Q3 2021, healthy demand amid moderate supply of prime logistics space has further tightened their vacancy rates, which are anticipated to remain low in the upcoming quarters. On the other hand, despite expected robust demand, occupancy rates of factory space could come under pressure in the latter part of 2021 and 2022 given the influx of new multi-user factory stock coming onstream after the year-long construction delays. Nevertheless, sustained uptrend in factory rents is expected, albeit tempered, underpinned by strong manufacturing output growth and progressive re-opening of the economy. Similarly, city fringe business park and warehouse rents are projected to continue rising. E-commerce needs together with vaccine and food storage requirements remain as key demand drivers for warehouse and prime logistics space in the near future.

On a quarter-on- quarter (q-o-q) seasonally-adjusted basis, Singapore's economy actually contracted by 1.8% in Q2 2021, compared to the 3.3% q-o-q expansion recorded in the first quarter of 2021. Manufacturing continued to drive the recovery in Singapore, as semiconductor manufacturers and sub-contractors supporting electronics firms reaped the benefits of the global chip shortage. The precision engineering and electronics clusters recorded 24.3% and 18.3% y-o-y growth respectively. These numbers were overshadowed by the impressive growths seen in the transport engineering and chemicals clusters, which recorded 29.6% and 20.1% y-o-y growth respectively, although this was largely the result of the low base effects in 2020. In September, the Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) recorded an expansion of 50.8 representing 15 consecutive months of expansion for the industrial sector, but a slight decline from the two-year high of 51.0 recorded in July. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in July and August 2021 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against April and May 2021) and y-o-y (against July and August 2020).

Monthly rental activity remained strong, recording a total of 1,809 rental transactions in July and August, representing an increase of 14.7% y-o-y from the 1,577 rental transactions in the same period last year, and a marginal increase of 0.4% from the 1,801 transactions in April and May 2021. Transactional activity in the multiple- user factory segment hit a lull in Q3 2021, with transactions totalling some S$309.5 million, led by the S$11 million sale of a 10,000-sf freehold strata unit in Ann Chuan Industrial Building. Prices generally remained stable in Q3 2021, averaging about S$414 psf on the back of sustained industrial activity (Exhibit 2). Although recent transactions have generally comprised properties with smaller quantums, more sizable deals are in the works. According to the Knight Frank Capital Markets team, larger sellers are taking advantage of improving industrial market sentiments to carry out previously planned asset disposals, using the opportunity to liquidate underutilised industrial properties. Despite the uptick in interest, it might take some time for such transactions to be reflected as these typically take around 10 to 12 months to complete.

Market outlook In accordance with the government's bid to produce 30% of Singapore's nutritional needs domestically, further investments were made in the domestic food and agri- tech industries. In September, top Japanese egg producer ISE Food Holdings signed a memorandum of understanding with the Singapore Food Agency to invest S$100 million to build Singapore's fourth egg farm. Construction is expected to begin in 2022, with facilities progressively opening from 2024 onwards. Alternative protein production also continued to gain traction in Singapore in Q3. Esco Aster, a Singaporean contract development and manufacturing organisation, gained approval and started production of cell-cultured chicken at their Ayer Rajah Crescent facility in July. In the same vein, Chinese biotech firm Avant announced the development of a pilot production facility for cultivated fish cells in September. The research laboratory will be located in Biopolis and is expected to begin operations by 2022. Growing food in urban Singapore Sustained demand for pandemic- era goods, such as bio-technology components, healthcare and sanitary goods, as well as electronics components for the pandemic-induced digital transformation, will continue to draw high-value-added manufacturing investment to Singapore. While the amount of upcoming industrial space has dropped to 53.0 million sf gross floor area (GFA) by end 2025, new supply remains substantial, with 18.8 million sf GFA and 17.3 million sf GFA expected to complete in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Nevertheless, healthy sustained demand and strong global manufacturing investment interest should allow rents to increase moderately between 1% and 3% for the whole of 2021 as expected. As Singapore stabilises from the fallout of the pandemic, factory prices and rents could potentially increase by 3% to 5% in 2022. $0 $100 $200 $300 $400 $500 $600 $700 $800 $900 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Benedict Yeo Executive Research +65 6228 6837 benedict.yeo@sg.knightfrank.com Recent Publications INDUSTRIAL Q2 2021 SINGAPORE VIEW 24TH EDITION Q3**"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

For the quarter in review, even though all industries registered YoY growth, momentum eased across the board. The manufacturing sector grew by 7.5% YoY in Q3, down from 18.0% YoY in Q2. The electronics and precision engineering clusters remained the main drivers, supported by sustained global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. The growth in Singapore's manufacturing activity also slowed slightly in August and September, with the Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) falling from 51.0 in July to 50.8 in September. Nonetheless, Singapore's factory sector has remained in positive territory for 15 consecutive months, owing to the resilient electronics sector. Singapore exports rose for a 10th straight month in September, up by 12.3% from a year ago. The growth was led by the petrochemicals, specialised machinery and pharmaceutical segments. RENTAL MARKET The leasing market saw its highest level of activity in Q3/2021, with total leasing volume1 rising 13.9% YoY to 3,423. The number of leases increased across all segments, especially for single-user factory (+77.8% YoY) and warehouse spaces (+21.7% YoY). Even though there was greater buying interest for single-user factory facilities for own use, leasing deals continued to climb in Q3 as there is still some mismatch between buyers and sellers' price expectations. The warehouse segment also saw strong take- up from industries such as ecommerce, electronics and third-party logistics. Despite a slower growth (+8.1% YoY) compared with other segments, the number of tenancies for multiple-user factory units is still on the high side. This was largely led by digital and creative businesses which are expanding their real estate footprint, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises in agricultural, plastic and metal manufacturing businesses. In terms of physical occupation, arising from new completions in the West Planning Region, the vacancy rate for single-user factory space rose 0.2 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 9.3% in Q3. However, with a relatively stable net take-up of 1.1 million sq ft, vacancy for multiple-user factories slipped by 0.1 of a ppt QoQ to 10.2%, the lowest since Q3/2013. For the warehouse segment, occupier demand in the West Planning Region remained healthy, with larger fi rms taking up signifi cant space in Tuas due to a lack of ready-built ramp-up facilities in other 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). parts of the island. Despite an addition of 111,000 sq ft of new warehouse stock in the region, vacancy in the West Planning Region managed to ease 0.3 of a ppt QoQ to 9.8% in Q3. The vacancy rate in the East Planning Region also fell 1.1 ppt QoQ to 7.8% in Q3, the lowest since Q1/2016. This was attributed to strong take-up from warehousing and logistics needs arising from ecommerce and consolidation of supply chains. Compared with Q2, industrial rents continued to post positive growth in Q3/2021. Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 registered a third consecutive quarterly increase of 1.7% QoQ to S$1.77 per sq ft. After witnessing no growth in Q2, Savills' average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics3 properties inched up by 0.3% QoQ to S$1.44 per sq ft, reaching its highest level since Q3/2014. SALES MARKET After some signs of slowing down in the fi rst half of this year, strata industrial sales activity started to pick up momentum in Q3. Sales volume4 increased by 3.7% QoQ to 472, bringing the total number of caveats to 1,387 over the fi rst three quarters. This has already surpassed the annual average of 1,206 for the last three years. The sales growth could be backed by buyers who are keen to purchase private properties as they do not have to go through stringent application procedures with JTC when buying public industrial properties. Moreover, they are also looking for capital appreciation potential from private property acquisition as these properties generally have longer lease tenures than JTC properties, with some even being freehold. Sales activity for multiple-user factory and warehouse spaces continued to pick up in Q3, rising by 4.6% and 35.7% QoQ respectively. While demand in the Central and North Planning Region stayed strong, there was an uptick in sales demand for multiple-user factory in the West Planning Region after a decline in the previous quarter. For the warehouse segment, most users within the West Planning Region tend to lease as they usually require large ramp-up facilities which are limited in the sales market. As such, the majority of the warehouse sales demand came from the Central Planning Region where smaller warehouse spaces are required for last mile delivery services. Interested buyers for single-user factories are still on the lookout, but very few translated into actual sales because of the price gap between buyers and sellers. As such, the sales volume for single-user factory spaces continued to fall by 34.4% QoQ in Q3. 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.40 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 15 November 2021.

As a result, Savills' basket of leasehold industrial properties showed that prices for freehold properties increased at a faster rate of 0.6% QoQ to S$710 per sq ft in Q3. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, 60-year leasehold prices rose by 1.0% QoQ to S$438 per sq ft. For the quarter in review, this was because sellers are more willing to negotiate prices before their leases deplete further, and buyers are looking for good deals with reasonable remaining leases. Compared with Q2, Savills' basket of leasehold industrial properties showed that prices for 30-year leasehold properties remained stable with a 0.1% increase to S$292 per sq ft in Q3. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Arising from the tight supply and steady demand in the Mapletree Business City and one-north regions, the vacancy level for business park space in the Central Planning Region eased by 0.7 of a ppt in Q2 to 10.2% in Q3. As a result of improving occupancy levels, prospective tenants are accepting higher rents for these prime locations, driving Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents up by 0.7% QoQ to S$5.80 per sq ft in Q3. After registering a record high vacancy level of 18.7% in Q2 due to a dip in demand in Changi Business Park, vacancy in the East Planning Region remained almost unchanged at 18.6% in Q3. On the other hand, vacancy in the West Planning Region spiked from 25.1% in Q2 to 30.0% in Q3. Even though vacancy for International Business Park only saw a marginal increase of 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 25.5%, the addition of new stock from the newly completed Cleantech Three put pressure on the overall occupancy in the West. Nonetheless, rents in the older business park clusters are starting to show signs of bottoming out, with Savills' standard business park properties6 monthly rents recovering by 0.5% QoQ to S$3.99 per sq ft in Q3. Overall sentiment remained mixed in the high-spec industrial leasing market. In the face of the accelerated pace of digital transformation, there is still demand from technology fi rms, as well as creative agencies which support ecommerce activity. However, as Grade B offi ce rents have reached a level where the rental gap between them and prime high-spec industrial spaces have narrowed considerably, more businesses that need quality spaces with a central location to maintain their corporate image are considering moving to Grade B offi ces. While landlords of prime high-spec industrial 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. spaces who have maintained their rental expectations (high-S$4 psf per month) faced slow take-up, owners of less prime or older high-spec industrial spaces who are willing to off er more aff ordable rents (around S$3 psf per month) continue to register good take-up. Nevertheless, selected developments have been attracting healthy demand and driving overall rental growth. In the reviewed quarter, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket7 went up by 0.8% QoQ to S$3.51 per sq ft. Having inserted the recently completed 351 on Braddell development into Savills' high-spec industrial basket, monthly rents increased by 1.7% QoQ to S$3.54 per sq ft in Q3. OUTLOOK The outlook of the industrial and logistics market will be impacted by micro and macro events. The former involves emerging industries which are taking root here. Notwithstanding the surge in supply in 2022, the overall occupancy rate is likely to stay unchanged as the increase could be matched by strong demand from these industries. Especially with a greater emphasis on healthcare, technology and digital transformation, new economy sectors such as biomedical sciences, digital and technology, continue to expand in Singapore. The vacancy level in areas like one-north are likely to remain tight with demand coming from companies engaged in technology and biomedical research and development (R&D). This has not gone unnoticed amongst landlords and 1 Science Park Drive is set to be redeveloped into a life science and innovation campus. Scheduled to complete by Q2/2025, the new campus will comprise three interconnected Grade 'A' buildings with over 1.2 million sq ft of new business park space. Around 860,000 sq ft, accounting for 71% of the total business park space, will be allocated for wet labs to accommodate biomedical R&D activities. Going forward, rents for prime business park space are likely to be lifted upon completion of such rejuvenation of older business park developments. On the macro front, while the disruptions wrought by SARs-CoV-2 continue to affl ict the offi ce, retail and hospitality sectors, industrial and warehousing continue to push against the tide of negativism. In fact, the uncertainty levels across many of the economic sectors are benefi tting these sectors. In the quarters ahead, the ramping up of economic activity in major commodity producing and manufacturing export powerhouses will continue to be plagued by supply chains problems. The supply side struggles to sate the demand for consumer goods which are continuing to break records as developed economies begin unlocking themselves from a prolonged period of 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft.

During the period of pandemic isolation, consumers got addicted to ecommerce, spurring demand for consumption goods. Within the supply chain industry, issues ranged from crews of container ships suff ering from burn out syndrome having remained for months onboard container carriers and prevented from on-shore visits due to strict pandemic measures; major ports becoming choke points as they lacked the effi ciencies of the Amazonian order taking-distribution process during a time when ecommerce is experiencing exponential growth; modern container ships are now two or three times bigger than they were 10 to 15 years ago, creating a chokepoint during offl oading; a shortage of truck drivers and a bunching up of containers in inland depots or stacking up at cargo ports. This year's Black Friday (November 26) and the year-end festive season will compound the COVID induced logjam further. That is not the end of the story. The rollout of new consumer products has driven up the demand for semiconductors. Before the start of the pandemic, the world was already in a tech boom. The strict lockdown measures in 2020 and 2021 threw both supply and demand badly off kilter. Across the board, primary and secondary inputs to the manufacturing process are seeing sharp increases in prices. Graphs 4 and 5 show that from the shipping cost of a 40-foot container to semiconductor prices, since 2019, all have increased substantially. Even crude oil prices are about 50% higher than they were at the start of 2019. For gains like wheat and corn, although global prices are not at record levels, they are closing in on their respective seven to eight-year highs. Today, both supply chain and semiconductor industry experts appear to hold the view that chaos in their respective markets will only be resolved by early-2023. The upshot of this logjam is infl ation and how long this will last will have a direct impact on our industrial and warehousing sectors. Infl ation is given a boost when in the US, money supply growth is still at rates signifi cantly higher than pre-pandemic times (please refer to Graph 6). Also, consumer credit there has been rising strongly on an annual basis with no signs of a let up in demand because salaries in Q3/2021 increased by 1.5% QoQ, the highest in 20 years. Nevertheless, it must be added that while demand in developed economies is growing, the constraints are building to a point where it has begun to hinder expansion. This would cap global GDP growth. However, even if economic growth tapers, it may not impact the industrial and logistics sector globally because the need to stockpile has become paramount. The same is true for Singapore but the reason has a slight twist. The litany of problems confronting major economies originated from the large production and end-demand countries, for example US consumer demand shot up due to pent up demand as states started to loosen movement restrictions, ports and semiconductor plants shut down during the pandemic etc. Their impact on Singapore is one where businesses supply to the domestic market needs to take account of the uncertainties surrounding supply and prices. The need to smooth over supply hiccups and combat infl ation should therefore lead to greater demand for warehouse space. If infl ation becomes endemic, besides hedging against future price increases by stockpiling merchandise, expect businesses to also attempt PERIOD YoY % CHANGE IN MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY RENTS YoY % CHANGE IN WAREHOUSE & LOGISTICS RENTS 2021F 2.5% to 4.5% 1.0% to 3.0% 2022F 1.0% to 2.0% 1.0% to 3.0% TABLE 1: Rental Forecast For Multiple-User Factory And Warehouse & Logistics Segments Source Savills Research & Consultancy to profi teer by building in anticipatory price increases. However, for the next one to two quarters, the impact of infl ation on rents is not one-one because the ability of tenants to pay much higher rents is still weak. It is weak because the delays in meeting production or construction deadlines plus rises in material prices cannot be fully passed through to the customer because many are caught in contracts signed during pre- COVID days which have limited scope to adjust for cost variations. Beyond that, businesses which made it through these tough times, will be those which are stronger and have a better ability to pay higher rents. On the capital markets side, sellers may withdraw from the market as they may fi nd replacement premises coming at a higher price or rent and this would move prices of industrial and warehousing space up. In view of the dynamics surrounding the rental and capital markets, we are forecasting rents in 2022 to rise by 2.0% to 3.0% with capital values rising between 3.0% to 5.0%. Warehousing space would see rental increases clustered around the higher end of the range and buildings with longer land lease terms remaining experiencing greater price appreciation. In summary, because both micro and macro forces are looking down favourably on the industrial and logistics sectors, the downside risk in 2022 is reduced considerably.

We forecast warehouse-logistics rent to grow 1.3% in 2021 on sustained demand from e-commerce growth. Rents of other industrial segments should also recover along with the economic recovery. We expect overall industrial vacancy rates to rise in 2021 from higher planned factory supply. Vacancy could improve from 2023 onwards as supply tapers off.

Manufacturing continued to outperform in Q2 2021, expanding by 18.5% YOY, with growth supported by output expansions in all clusters except for the biomedical manufacturing cluster. Over the next 10 years, Singapore intends to grow its manufacturing sector by 50%, maintaining its contribution at about a fifth of economic output over the medium term. According to Colliers' research, average monthly industrial gross rents declined 0.4% HOH in H1 2021, as supply jumped 8.5x HOH. Warehouse rents did well rising 0.7% HOH to SGD1.22 (USD0.91) per sq ft, while Business Park rents weakened 1.2% HOH after being the most resilient segment in 2020. Based on data from JTC, all- industrial occupancy improved marginally by 0.2ppts to 90.1% in H1 2021, led by Multi-user factories which saw occupancy rise 1.2ppts HOH to 89.7%, while all other segments saw a drop in occupancy as landlords prioritised rents over occupancy amid a recovery. As supply completions gain momentum, 2021 supply, 69% of which is factory space, looks abundant at 21.3 million sq feet (2.0 million sq metres) barring further construction delays. This is equivalent to 1.6x the 10-year historical average as factory supply is scheduled to increase 5.1x YOY. As such, we expect all- industrial vacancy to rise 1.4 ppt to 11.5% by end of 2021. Recovery underway in 2021 In 2021, we expect the industrial sector to recover along with the overall economy, with Oxford Economics forecasting GDP growth of 6.4% in 2021. We forecast sustained warehouse demand to drive 1.3% YOY rental growth, the highest among all segments, led by ramp-up logistics space. Business Park and Factory rents could rise at a slower rate of 0.5% YOY and 0.7% YOY respectively given ample supply. We expect rents of hi-specs space to grow 0.8%, supported by the technology sector.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Singapore Economy Got Back on Track Singapore economy turned around by 1.3% yoy in Q1 2021, while the labour market has improved with unemployment rate falling to 2.6% in the same period. The outperforming manufacturing sector continued to be the main GDP driver, expanding by 10.7% yoy in Q1 2021. Based on data released by EDB, manufacturing growth between January and May 2021 has been led by output expansions in three key sub-sectors - Electronics that soared 22.9% yoy, Precision Engineering that rose 22.7% yoy and Chemicals that increased 10.3% yoy. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stayed in expansion territory at 50.8 points in June 2021, even as community infection cases resurged and pandemic measures tightened in the region. City Fringe Business Parks Leading the Pack in Growth Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, city fringe business park rents registered the highest growth of 2.3% qoq in Q2 2021, as vacancy rates continue to fall to 7.8% in Q2 2021 compared to 9.9% in the preceding quarter. Blue chip corporations across the thriving technology and pharmaceutical sectors have been drawn to city fringe business parks due to the robust infrastructure and favourable locality to reach talents and users. Coupled with firms in CBD decentralising more back-end functions such as R&D, the city fringe business park segment is expected to achieve the highest growth rate in 2021. The segment's sanguine outlook is also backed by strong investment sales such as Ascendas Reit acquiring the remaining 75% stake in Galaxis for $534m. Science Park, high tech, prime logistics and warehousing spaces also outperformed in tandem with the K-shaped economic recovery, registering a qoq rental growth of 0.6%, 0.2%, 1.6% and 0.9% respectively. These segments that cater to the rapidly expanding advanced manufacturing and e-commerce sectors, will see higher rental growth potential amid increasing demand and limited supply. In contrast, outlying business park rents continued to be pulled down by older developments, dropping by 0.5% qoq in Q1 2021, while factory rents held steady due to limited new supply. Broad-based Growth Expected across Factory Spaces Towards the End of 2021 Amidst the recovering economy, widespread growth in the industrial market, including all segments of factory spaces, are expected towards the end of 2021 or early 2022. As output demand continues to grow, more manufacturing firms could seize the opportunity to expand, positioning for growth amidst roll-out of vaccines and reopening of global economies. Expansions of food establishments and cloud kitchens will continue to drive demand for food zone factories, while electronics occupiers will go on to pursue high-specification factory spaces amidst digital transformation. For instance, GlobalFoundries was reported to be investing over $4 billion to build a new fabrication plant in Singapore to meet the unprecedented global demand for chips. Although demand for conventional factory spaces has faltered, their rents will hold firm this year, as new supply may be further delayed due to labour constraints and tightened measures. This is also supported by the 6.2% yoy (January to May 2021 YTD) expansion of the general manufacturing sector in terms of manufacturing outputs.

Investment volume for Q2 2021 was boosted by residential and industrial transactions. For the residential sector, investment sales increased by 92.6% quarter-on-quarter to $3.098 bn, mainly due to the sale of three Government Land Sales (GLS) sites (Northumberland Road, Ang Mo Kio Ave 1, and Tengah Garden Walk (EC)). Excluding these GLS sites, residential sales volume still stood at $1.871 bn, attributed to healthy activity in the luxury market for good class bungalows and luxury apartments. This reflects the confidence both private buyers and developers have in the long-term future and potential of Singapore real estate market. Industrial transactions kept its pace at $992.06 mil this quarter. This reflects just a slight 7.9% drop q-o-q from the large transactions and Boustead portfolio deal recorded last quarter. AREIT acquired the remaining 75% interest in Galaxisfor $534 mil, while ESR REIT acquired Global Trade Logistics Centre, a prime logistics facility for $119.6 mil. In addition to these two major transactions, another eight factories and five warehouses were transacted.The active real estate investment sales scene in Singapore indicates that there is abundant liquidity waiting to be deployed, with investors undeterred by travel restrictions and the recent heightened measures. Undeniably, technology had a big part to play with facilitating deals through virtual viewings and presentations.For the remaining quarters of 2021, in addition to some attractive and relatively large GLS sites which have their tenders closing, there are also a handful of large-quantum quality commercial assets coming onto the market. These should provide a further boost to investment volumes. Consequently, CBRE Research believes that investment sales volume for 2021 is likely to see a strong rebound from the previous year, led by residential, office, and industrial sales.

Initially, leasing momentum gathered pace as business sentiment improved and more staff were allowed to return to the office. However, the emergence of COVID-19 clusters led to the tightening of measures in May. Under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), restrictions were imposed to curb the transmission of the virus. Once again, work from home became the default working arrangement and these restrictions impacted leasing enquiry levels.Net absorption was -0.36 mil sq. ft. in Q2 2021, which was contributed by the earlier relocation moves and downsizing efforts by occupiers. Coupled with the injection of the uncommitted supply in Afro-Asia, islandwidevacancy rate rose from 5.9% in Q1 2021 to 6.8% in Q2 2021. With limited new and expansionary demand, most of the leasing transactions comprised renewals and relocations. Key demand drivers were confined to the technology and financial services sectors, and to a lesser degree, transport & storage, and energy & commodities firms. As a result of earlier relocation moves, Grade A vacancy rates rose from 3.3% in Q1 2021 to 4.4% in Q2 2021. Nevertheless, this remained well below the 10-year historical average vacancy rate of 5.9%. Encouraged by the fairly tight vacancy rate in the Grade A market, some landlords of better performing buildings have begun to push for higher rents as they benefit from the prevailing tightness. In Q2 2021, Grade A Core CBD rents rose 1.0% q-o-q to $10.50 psf/month, the first rental growth since Q4 2019. Conversely, the Grade B market struggled to backfill the existing vacant stock, and this placed further pressure on Grade B Core CBD rents.Looking forward, there are still potential risks on the demand side, but the tapering supply pipeline bodes well for the market. It remains a two-tiered market; the medium-term outlook for the Grade A market looks positive, but the recovery in the Grade B market is likely to lag the Grade A market as landlords grapple with rising vacancy rates.

Islandwidenet absorption was 0.13 mil sq. ft. in Q2 2021. The two business parks that obtained TOP in Q2 2021 were located in one-north: Razer's SEA headquarters along one-north Crescent and Wilmar's headquarters along BiopolisRoad. This resulted in 0.16 mil sq. ft. of net supply. With net absorption trailing behind net supply, islandwidevacancy rate rose marginally from 12.9% in Q1 2021 to 13.0% in Q2 2021. The only firms that exhibited expansionary appetite within the business park sector were those in the technology and media industries. While most of the leasing demand was concentrated within the new builds of higher specifications within the City Fringe submarket, some positive take-up was also noted in the Rest of Island submarket in this quarter. Given the high vacancy rates in the Rest of Island submarket, landlords maintained some flexibility in rental negotiations, and this helped to shore up occupancy levels. In Q2 2021, rents in the Rest of Island submarket kept stable at $3.65 psf/month. On the other hand, the City Fringe submarket continued to be underpinned by tight availability of space for lease. With strong demand for space in this submarket, City Fringe rents expanded by 0.9% q-o-q to $5.80 psf/month in Q2 2021. Over the next three and a half years, a total of 5.04 mil sq. ft. of new supply is expected to come onstream. With only 13.2% of upcoming supply located within the City Fringe submarket, any rental growth is likely to stem from the one-north precinct as this submarket is underpinned by tight availability of space and high demand. However the same level of optimism is not reflected in the other submarkets; with 86.8% of upcoming supply located within the Rest of island submarket, there is likely to be further downward pressure on rents in the Rest of Island submarket. Nonetheless, overall demand for the business park market remains resilient.

MARKETVIEWThe retail market encountered another setback with stricter measures during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 16 May till 13 June 2021. Retail sales (excluding motor vehicles), posted a decline of 6.3% m-o-m in May 2021, with department stores, wearing apparel & footwear and watches & jewellery the most affected. It was observed that F&B operators were more adjusted to delivery and takeaway with the dine-in ban, as compared to last year's \"circuit breaker\" period. Amongst the physical constraints that COVID-19 posed this year, the Great Singapore Sales took an omnichannel format, with e-commerce platforms being actively involved.Despite the uncertainty, new openings and expansions were observed in the F&B, sporting goods and fashion segment. That said, for certain segments, the number of closures outweighed openings, with fashion, F&B and entertainment segments having the highest number of casualties. For instance, Karaoke Manekinekoclosed all its outlets; Marche Movenpick and Food Republic closed its Raffles City and Capitol Piazza outlet respectively, while TEMT and Abercrombie & Fitch exited the Singapore market. With work-from-home remaining as the default and tourism borders still closed, the retail market continue to face pressures though the magnitude of rental decline has slowed. Islandwide prime retail rents fell by 0.4% q-o-q this quarter, as compared to -1.2% q-o-q in Q1 2021. This was mainly propped up by the suburban market, where prime spaces registered healthy reversionary rents. As such, the rental gap between Orchard and suburban markets narrowed further.Even though the retail market is poised to benefit from an improvement in economic activity and consumer sentiment on the back of the vaccination rollout, the retail sector has yet to reach full recovery. Secondary outbreaks could continue to disrupt economic activity and tightening of border controls will be a continued setback to the market recovery for the rest of 2021.

Preliminary estimates for new home sales year to date came to 5,652 units, which is already 56.6% of the volume achieved last year. This was bolstered by the year to date sales of Irwell Hill Residences (332 units), Provence Residence (245 units) and Normanton Park (191 units). With safe distancing measures at show galleries relaxed, this momentum is likely to continue as developers are encouraged to proceed with their launches, with more mass market launches in the pipeline.According to URA's flash estimates, private residential property prices rose 0.9% in Q2 2021, a slowdown compared to Q1 2021's 3.3% increase. Within the non-landed segment, the stronger price increase in the OCR (1.8% q-o-q) was weighed down by the CCR (0.6% q-o-q) and RCR (0.3% q-o-q). The slower growth could be attributed to a slower pace of launches due to restrictions in the first half of May, pushing buyers to the resale market. Further, the trend for larger homes may have resulted in lower psfprices for some projects. There was also healthy take-up from earlier launches in the suburban market, which signifies resilient demand from upgraders.Private property prices have increased by 4.3% year to date. The moderation in price growth might have lowered the risks of cooling measures being implemented. While the government is expecting a GDP growth forecast of 4-6%, the launch of some upcoming projects at higher psf pricing might continue to push the price index higher to exceed this forecast.New launches have been predominantly located in the CCR and RCR locations year-to-date. However, the next few major launches will mostly be mass-market projects in the OCR. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, CBRE Research expects new home sales to fall within the region of 10,000 to 11,000 units for 2021. In the longer term, the potential reopening of borders will also bring about the return of foreign investors and buying interest to the luxury segment.

Manufacturing output rose by 30.0% y-o-y in May, its fastest pace in a decade due to the low base effect in part to \"circuit breaker\" measures last year. Highest increases were observed in biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering clusters, due to higher production of semiconductor equipment. NODX increased 8.8% y-o-y in May 2021, the sixth consecutive month of exports growth, while SIPMM's PMI sustained its expansion for the eleventh consecutive month in June 2021.Leasing activity continued to remain stable in Q2 2021, consisting of new set ups and relocations. Warehouse leasing volume increased the fastest, with third-party logistics and marine & offshore being the main demand drivers. Furthermore, recent commitments byBioNTechand Sanofi to build their vaccine production facility in Singapore shows the endorsements of the biopharmaceutical segment, which bodes well for Singapore's advanced manufacturing scene in the mid to long term. On the back of healthy demand, factory rents tracked by CBRE Research registered its first quarter of increase by 0.7% q-o-q in Q2 2021. Space availability for the warehouse and prime logistics remained tight, hence rents for both segments began to materialise at a quicker pace, by 1.3% q-o-q and 2.9% q-o-q respectively. Moving forward, the positive outlooks for Singapore's manufacturing and e-commerce sectors will underpin demand for quality factory and warehouse space. Warehouse rents are expected to grow at a faster pace as vacancies among prime logistics remain extremely low, in addition to a more manageable warehouse pipeline. Take-up for JTC Logistics Hub @ Gul and LOGOS Tuas Logistics Hub have been healthy, driven by e-commerce, food stockpiling and third-party logistics storage for pharmaceutical and oil & gas. On the other hand, the rental performance for the factory submarket could be weighed down by older stock, as the submarket remains two-tier.

It came on the back of the manufacturing sector's 10.7% yoy growth, faster than the 10.3% growth recorded in 4Q 2020. * The two worst performing sectors in 4Q 2020, namely construction and the transportation and storage sector, saw expansion during this quarter. The construction sector contracted by 22.7% yoy in 1Q 2021 (compared with -27.4% in 4Q 2020) and the transportation and storage sector shrank by 16.5% (compared with -27.4% in 4Q 2020). * Singapore attracted $2.8bn in FAI in 1Q 2021, a slight decrease from $3.0bn in 4Q 2020 with the services sector leading at $1.6bn. The info-communications and media cluster within the service sector drew $1.1bn of FAI. Investors from the United States contributed the most to the total FAI in 1Q 2021. Singapore's efforts to keep borders open, stay connected, and ensure business continuity have given global firms the confidence to invest in projects in the Republic. * The labour market continued to recover from the impact of the pandemic. The unemployment rate declined to 2.9% in 1Q 2021 from 3.3% in 4Q 2020. Employment grew in 1Q 2021 by 14,000 workers after four quarters of decline. In 1Q 2021, the bulk of the employment increases were in services. The unemployment rate for May declined to 2.8%. * Inflation may pick up due to low base effects from last year but is unlikely to step up excessively in the second half of 2021. External inflation expected to rise in the near term amid the recovery in global oil prices and the rebound of the world's two largest economies i.e. the US and China. As for Singapore, price pressures are likely to gradually pick up as the labour market and private consumption nudged up. * The external economic environment has improved since February 2021 mainly due to upgrades in the growth outlook for advanced economies like the United States. * While the tightening of domestic restrictions and border controls in May 2021 represented a setback to segments of the Singapore economy, this was partially relaxed partially in June 2021 and the broader economy should still see a recovery this year in tandem with the global economic rebound and further progress in the domestic vaccination programme. * On 25 May 2021, MTI forecasted Singapore's economic growth in the range of 4% to 6% in 2021. While a survey conducted by MAS of private- sector economists on 14 June 2021 showed that Singapore's GDP tipped to grow 6.5% in 2021, led by manufacturing and exports. * Singapore is reopening in a calibrated manner and will have more confidence to ease up further when two- thirds of the population is fully vaccinated by National Day (9 August), as targeted.

As there was no activity in GLS in 1Q 2021, the government sold three residential sites in this quarter. The tenders drew intense competition from 7 to 15 bidders per site, who ran out of land amid healthy home sales. * Commercial sales in 2Q 2021 comprised 15% office, 8% retail and 4% shop house deals. In addition, the transactions for office and retail sales were predominantly strata-titled transactions or acquisitions of the remaining stakes of investors' existing properties. * Ascendas Reit acquired the remaining 75% interest in Galaxis. It now has full ownership of the property. Galaxis is a business park located in One-North which houses key growth sectors such as biomedical sciences, information and communications technologies and media, science and research institutes as well as start-ups. * Subsidiaries from SingHaiyi, Chip Eng Seng and Hong Kong-listed Chuan Holdings won the collective sale tender for Maxwell House, a 13-storey commercial building, which has potential for redevelopment into a mixed-use development. * Lendlease Global Commercial Reit proposed to increase its effective interest to 31.8% in Jem, which is a 108,170sqm mixed- use development comprising of retail (major use) and office. Key tenants include Singapore's Ministry of National Development, Swedish furniture chain IKEA, hypermarket FairPrice Xtra and fashion retailers H&M and Uniqlo. * RESIDENTIAL: The government is releasing more private housing sites for sale in 2H 2021 by almost 25%, under the Confirmed List of the GLS programme, due to the dwindling unsold inventory of the private housing units. Amidst robust housing demand and riding on the positive market outlook, more developers are actively seeking to replenish their residential land banks, which may result in stiffer competition to secure a site. * RETAIL: This sector expected to take longer to recover given the lack of tourists, the return of tighter measures due to the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, and the impact of remote working. These may add pressure on occupancy and investment activities. * OFFICE: There are uncertainties over the longer-term impact of remote working on office demand. Healthy buildings are the new minimum and there is an increasing need for space that can flexibly adapt to the requirements of a post-Covid world, where the role of the office shifts towards collaboration and innovation. * INDUS TRIAL: We obser ve that investments in data centres, logistics and warehouse facilities, as well as cloud kitchens are on the rise. Covid-19 has brought many opportunities for new businesses. With the industrial upswing speeding ahead, it may be apt to innovate and invest in business expansion towards research & development and advanced manufacturing. Additionally, under the Industrial GLS programme, more industrial land totalling 5.14ha will be available for sale in 2H 2021, increased from 3.86ha in 1H 2021. 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH OFFICE - Occupiers value flexibility 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2021 2022 2023 2024 Under Construction Planned mn sq ft KEY HIGHLIGHTS Average monthly gross rents (SGD/sq ft) SUPPLY - Singapore OFFICE SUPPLY (sq ft) OFFICE SUPPLY PIPELINE (2021-2024) (sq ft) As of 2Q 2021, nearly 4.6mn sq ft of new office space will be completed from 2021 to 2024, down from 4.9mn as of 1Q 2021.

The improvement fuelled by the decentralised regions, which experienced the highest positive net absorption, a testament to the trend of decentralisation, as more companies opt for offices located outside the CBD. * Occupancy rate for CBD has fallen by 0.7% pts in 2Q 2021 from 92.7% in 4Q 2020. As companies re-evaluate their business operations needs due to Covid-19, they are rethinking their real estate footprint, with some preferring the \"asset light\" approach. This approach enables them to have some cost savings from office rents, flexibility and also allow them to transit their office spaces into an avenue for collaboration and socialisation. * The recent Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) curbs have resulted in working-from-home still being the default arrangement in Singapore, resulting in thinner crowds at hot office spots. However, with Singapore hastening its roll out of vaccination and controlling the spread of the virus, we expect more office goers to return to their offices to work, albeit on a more flexible basis. * As companies revaluate their office spaces and the economy gradually recovers, the trend of flexible workspaces expected to continue, as seen from the expansion plans of the co-working operator, JustCo. In March 2021, JustCo announced its plans to open an office in Tampines located at Asia Green and further announced in June 2021 that they will manage and occupy two floors at The Metropolis in Buona Vista, the only Grade-A office located in One-North precinct. * Tenants continues to shift towards better quality buildings, as better property management by developers provide a higher ventilation system in buildings which prevents the spread of Covid-19. A safe work environment translates to better employee well-being and productivity. * Office demand is bolstered by Information and communications, finance, and insurance sectors. Employment in these sectors has improved and fuelled by government support, job schemes and overseas foreign investment. The MAS is projecting 6,500 jobs in the finance sector this year, while retaining existing employees. The demand and expansion of the technology workforce by companies have contributed significantly to employment. * Monthly rents in the various subzones of the office sector held steady or declined slightly in 2Q 2021. Within the CBD and Non-CBD subzones, there is a continued emphasis on a flight to quality office spaces while taking advantage of the current climate to negotiate better rates for office rentals. Overall, we expect a bottom in the office market by the end of the year. 8 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL - Expected to ride on global trade growth 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 First-storey multiple-user factory Upper-storey multiple-user factory $ psf 70 80 90 100 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1Q 2021 Single-user factory Multiple-user factory Business park Warehouse % KEY HIGHLIGHTS RENTAL OF FIRST STOREY MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY OCCUPANCY RATE OF MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY Buoyant prospects for the manufacturing sector drove the slight 1.0% qoq increase in rent.

The purchasing managers' index (PMI) recorded a marginal increase in June 2021, with a reading of 50.8, marking the 12th straight month expansion (i.e., with a reading above 50) from 50.7 in May. The increase was attributed to faster expansion rates in the key indices of new orders, new exports, factory output, inventory and employment. * Non-oil exports (NODX) rose 9.7% yoy in 1Q 2021 reversing the dip of 0.5% in 4Q 2021. The expansion was driven by electronic products such as integrated circuits, personal computers, telecom gear and non-electronic products like specialised machinery, petrochemicals, primary chemicals. * Overall industrial net absorption decreased from 2.3mn sq ft in 4Q 2020 to 1.5mn sq ft in 1Q 2021. Demand was contributed by the multiple-user factory segment (1.0mn sq ft) and warehouse segment (0.6mn sq ft), while the negative business park segment showed negative net absorption of 0.1mn sq ft. * Island-wide, only the multiple-user factory occupancy rate increased in 1Q 2021 (0.6% qoq). The rest of the occupancy rates for other industrial segments decreased with business park declining the most at 0.8% qoq. * Approximately 46% of the supply pipeline will be completed in 2021, followed by 33% in 2022. Multiple- user factories accounted for the bulk (33%) of the supply pipeline with approximately 13.7mn sq ft NLA. Single-user factory space made up 22% of the supply pipeline, projected to be about 9.0mn sq ft NLA. * The full-year trajectory for manufacturing remains sound which saw little impact from stricter Covid-19 measures during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). * Barring a worsening of the Covid-19 situation, the manufacturing sector is expected to be one of the key pillars of growth, as export-oriented industries ride on global trade growth. * Prices and rentals of industrial space are likely to remain stable for 2021 with higher-than-average supply pipeline balancing off with improving demand. * We see substantial investments in new economy assets like data centres. For instance, in May 2021, Mapletree Industrial Trust proposed a US$1.32b acquisition of 29 data centres in the United States. Likewise, in June 2021, Singapore-based Princeton Digital revealed that it is investing US$1b to build a data centre campus in Japan. In March 2021, Ascendas Reit announced its US$0.67b acquisition of 11 data centres in Europe. In 2019, the Singapore government imposed a moratorium (temporary pause) on new data centres built locally due to concerns over the industry's carbon footprint. The local authorities are expected to provide an update on the moratorium situation at the end of the year. * The shift of food & beverage (F&B) sales online, triggered by Covid-19, drove the growth of cloud kitchens. We see cloud kitchen as an emerging niche market segment with significant growth opportunities.

The occupancy rate increased by 0.3% pts qoq to 91.5% in 1Q 2021 from 91.2% in 4Q 2020. * The occupancy rate for the Fringe/ Suburban area improved by 0.8% pts to 93.3% in 1Q 2021. More retailers prefer to open their shops located at the Fringe/Suburban subzone due to the sustained footfall and the continuation of the work-from-home arrangements for some companies, especially for the food and beverage sectors located at suburban malls. * The 3-month moving average of yoy change in retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) improved from -5.7% in December 2020 to 35.2% in May 2021. Retail sales grew for the third consecutive month yoy, implying an improvement in retail sales as Singapore continues to gradually open its economy. * Retail sales for furniture & household equipment, recreational goods, watches & jewellery and computer & telecommunications continued to grow yoy in 1Q 2021. Consumers were still cautious in their spending of discretionary items. For 1Q 2021, watches & jewellery reported the highest growth in sales of 22.6% yoy. However, food & alcohol declined the most by 26.2% yoy. * For the food and beverage services index for 1Q 2021, food caterers reported the greatest decline of 60.4% yoy, due to the continued restriction of large gatherings, resulting in the low demand for event catering. Restaurants sales registered a moderated improvement of -33.1% yoy in 4Q 2020 to a -6.3% in 1Q 2021. * As more retailers jump onto the bandwagon of setting up online stores to drive sales, Robinsons has recently announced that it will partner with Grab and return as an online department store. Additionally, with the Great Singapore Sale (GSS) taking an omni-channel approach this year, we expect more retailers to reinvent and adopt this new approach to drive sales. By partnering with Lazada, retailers can leverage the ease of accessibility of applications and online platforms. * As retail tenants face a challenging business climate amid tightening social distancing restrictions and capacity limits, landlords should continue managing their expectations in terms of retail rents. Support extended to assist retailers, in terms of rental incentives, more flexible operating hours and digital marketing of products to reach broader consumers. * We expect potential upside for retail rents in the Fringe/Suburban Areas, given the continued strong retail performance and the tight supply pipeline. With the lack of tourism and office crowd due to the work- from-home arrangement, landlords of retail malls at Orchard/Scotts Road and Other City Areas are more flexible their commercial terms, to optimize their trade mix. 12 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 1Q 2011 1Q 2012 1Q 2013 1Q 2014 1Q 2015 1Q 2016 1Q 2017 1Q 2018 1Q 2019 1Q 2020 1Q 2021 Residential pipeline Total unsold Years to clear unsold based on 3-year moving average new sales per annum (RHS) Units Years 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 100,000 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Units RESIDENTIAL - Sustained interest in the private residential sector as economy charts its path of recovery 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 1Q 2011 3Q 2011 1Q 2012 3Q 2012 1Q 2013 3Q 2013 1Q 2014 3Q 2014 1Q 2015 3Q 2015 1Q 2016 3Q 2016 1Q 2017 3Q 2017 1Q 2018 3Q 2018 1Q 2019 3Q 2019 1Q 2020 3Q 2020 1Q 2021 All Residential Price Index Landed Non-landed 1Q 2009 = 100 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 1Q 2011 1Q 2012 1Q 2013 1Q 2014 1Q 2015 1Q 2016 1Q 2017 1Q 2018 1Q 2019 1Q 2020 1Q 2021 Primary sales Secondary sales Residential launches* Unit KEY HIGHLIGHTS PROPERTY PRICE INDEX OF ALL PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES RESIDENTIAL PIPELINE SUPPLY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SALES TRANSACTION VOLUME PRIVATE HOME RENTAL TRANSACTIONS In 2Q 2021, based on URA's flash estimate, the Property Price Index (PPI) for all private residential properties, including Executive Condominiums, rose for the fifth consecutive quarter by 0.9% qoq to 163.7. This rise attributed to a 0.8% qoq increase in the PPI for landed private properties to 186.9, and a 0.9% qoq increase in the PPI for non-landed private properties to 158.5 in 2Q 2021. The residential supply pipeline decreased qoq in 1Q 2021. The total number of unsold units dropped 11.1% qoq. Correspondingly, the time needed to clear the unsold units have shrunk to 2.6 years from 2.9 years in 4Q 2020, based on a 3-year moving average of 9,563 units per annum for take-up of new units. Based on caveats lodged between 1 Apr and 27 Jun this year, overall sales transaction volumes for private residential units decreased qoq by 10.3% in 2Q 2021. The transaction volumes for both the primary and secondary markets declined qoq, by 18.5% and 4.1% respectively. The volume of private home rental transactions decreased marginally qoq by 1.0% in 1Q 2021. Conversely, on a yoy basis, there was a growth of 9.0%, suggesting a relatively stable and robust private homes rental market despite the ongoing pandemic. 1Q 2021 23,622 units 4Q 2020 23,854 units 2Q 2021 (URA flash estimate) 163.7 1Q 2021 162.2 2Q 2021 (caveats between 1 Apr 21 and 27 Jun 21) 7,267 units 1Q 2021 8,100 units Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA * Residential launch data for 2Q 2021 are based on new launches in Apr 21 and May 21 only. 1Q 2021 50,906 units, 24,401 total unsold 4Q 2020 52,403 units, 27,437 total unsold 13 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH MARKET COMMENTARY MARKET OUTLOOK * Based on URA's flash estimate for 2Q 2021, the PPI for all private residential properties rose for the fifth consecutive quarter, albeit at a slower rate of 0.9% qoq versus 3.3% qoq in 1Q 2021. The PPI for non-landed private residential properties rose at a marginally faster rate than landed private residential properties. Across the various market segments for the non-landed properties, the price increase was most pronounced in the Outside Central Region (OCR), at 1.8% qoq as compared to 0.6% and 0.3% for the Core Central Region (CCR) and Rest of Central Region (RCR) respectively. This trend suggested strong demand for units in the OCR against the backdrop of prevailing decentralisation and work-from-home trends. * Based on caveats lodged between 1 Apr 21 and 27 Jun 21, new sales and secondary transaction volumes dipped qoq in 2Q 2021. New sales volume recorded a more significant decline of 18.5% qoq. Across the market segments, new sales volumes within the RCR and OCR witnessed qoq declines of 40.9% and 2.3% respectively. On the other hand, new sales volume in the CCR witnessed a qoq growth of 16.6%. * The growth in new sales volume in the CCR correlated with the location of the new residential launches of this year. There were nine significant launches of non- landed projects between the start of the year and end-May 2021, out of which five (Midtown Modern, The Atelier, Irwell Hill Residences, Peak Residence, and Grange 1866) were located in the CCR. * The residential pipeline supply and the total number of unsold units for 1Q 2021 have declined, respectively for the third and ninth consecutive quarters. Based on the current 3-year moving average of new units take- up per annum, it would take an estimated 2.6 years to clear up the unsold supply. The government is cognisant of the tightening of the residential pipeline, and has decided to moderately increase the supply of private housing through the 2H 2021 Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. * In the private residential leasing market, total rental volume declined marginally by 0.97% qoq to 23,622 transactions in 1Q 2021. However, there was a 9.0% yoy growth from 1Q 2020, suggesting a relatively stable rental market for private homes. * As the economy gradually recovers against the backdrop of local and global vaccination programmes, the demand for private homes will likely hold steady amidst a low interest rate environment with ample liquidity and optimistic market sentiments. * Barring possible imposition of policy measures to cool the market, the private homes market is likely to remain on sound footing with transaction activity staying robust. * A further boost could be due to the increasing number of prospective HDB upgraders coming off a buoyant HDB resale market. * On the supply side, developers could continue to price new units at a premium to account for increases in construction costs resultant from a tight foreign labour market and delayed timelines due to COVID-19. * We expect developers to continue striving for products incorporating new home and lifestyle concepts that support the new normal of work, live, and play. * We expect the mass rental market to see sustained demand from expatriates relocating from prime properties and foreign workers seeking temporary accommodation due to the ongoing border restrictions.

Nonetheless, retail sales in April and May 2021 remained below pre-COVID levels. * Landlords compromised further on rents to support occupancy given the weak retail sales following a tightening of COVID-19 measures and uncertain business prospects after aresurgence inCOVID cases. Hence, rents of prime floor space fell q-o-q across the three sub-markets in 2Q21 but the pace of decline moderated. * Investment sales rose q-o-q, lifted by Sun Venture Realty's sale of a 45% interest in Paya Lebar Square for SGD 162.0 million and the sale of a 100% interest in Le Quest by Qingjian Realty and minority shareholders for SGD 139.4 million. * Achieving a high vaccination rate in 2H21, combined with the effective containment of the COVID-19 pandemic will support the further lifting of safe-distancing measures and the gradual easing of travel restrictions. This will lift retailer and consumer sentiment and, in turn, drive retail sales and business expansion. Thus, vacancy rates could fall in the short-term and rent declinesshould ease further. Warehouse * Demand for logistics/warehouse space remained healthy in 2Q21, underpinned by requirements from third-party logistics players and e-commerce firms. There were also enquiries for cold-room or temperature-controlled facilities. * The islandwide average logistics/warehouse rent rose in 2Q21 after holding steady for the past four quarters, driven by relatively tight supply, especially for better quality logistics assets. * Strong competition for logistics/warehouse assets drove up the average logistics/warehouse capital value for the first time in more than three years, and compressed yields in 2Q21. * Given the weight of capital chasing logistics/warehouse assets amid an earlier-than-expected rent recovery, we expect capital values to continue heading north, while yields are foreseen to compress further.AuthorsTay Huey YingHead of Research & ConsultancySingaporeHueyying.tay@ap.jll.com Ong Teck HuiSenior Director, ResidentialResearchSingaporeTeckhui.ong@ap.jll.comAngelia PhuaDirector, RetailResearchSingaporeAngelia.phua@ap.jll.comDoreen Goh Director, IndustrialResearchSingaporeDoreen.goh@ap.jll.comMichelle TeeDirector, OfficeResearchSingaporeMichelle.tee@ap.jll.comJLL Singapore9 Raffles Place#39-00 Republic PlazaSingapore 048619tel +65 6220 3888fax +65 6438 3361jll.com.sg 121.7Current stock (sq ft million) 1.37Gross effective rent (SGD psf pm NLA) 1.5%Rental growth (q-o-q) 190Capital value(SGD psf NLA) 6.2%Capital value growth (q-o-q)BanditsAll data are reflective of the islandwide market 5.1Current stock (sq ft million) 35.24Gross effective rent (SGD psf pm NLA) -3.3%Rental growth (q-o-q) 8,343Capital value (SGD psf NLA) -0.5%Capital value growth (q-o-q)All data are reflective of the Prime sub-submarketjll.com.sgCEA Licence No. L3007326E(c) Copyright 2021JLL.

Manufacturing continued to drive Singapore's recovery, with output expansions in electronics, precision engineering and chemical clusters outweighing output declines in the transport engineering, general manufacturing, and biomedical manufacturing clusters. In particular, semiconductor manufacturers and sub-contractors supporting electronics firms were observed to be exploring expansion space to ramp up production in Q2 2021, especially so with the global chip shortage and overall increasing reliance on devices in the pandemic era. In May 2021, the Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) recorded an expansion of 50.7, representing the 11th consecutive month of expansion for the industrial sector. This was a dip of 0.2 from the previous two-year high of 50.9 reported in April 2021, and slight fall from the 50.8 reported at the end of Q1 2021. Nevertheless, the persistent expansion in the PMI serves as a reassuring indicator that the industrial sector will be in a state of continued growth throughout 2021. 1The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in April and May 2021 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against January and February 2021) and y-o-y (against April and May 2020).

Despite that, the monthly data suggested an improvement in both rents and rental activity, mirroring the trends seen in the manufacturing sector at large. Continued on next page With the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the importance domestic vaccine production, Singapore managed to attract two vaccine manufacturers to open vaccine production centres in the country. In May, BioNTech, the German biotechnology company responsible Vaccine giants set up shop in Singapore As a result, there was a total of 1,801 rental transactions in April and May, representing an increase of 43.7% y-o-y from the 1,253 rental transactions in the same period last year, and an increase of 15.2% from 1,564 transactions in January and February 2021. With an increasing urgency to fulfil orders from all over the world, producers of technological components were active in seeking expansion space in order to grow output. The multiple-user factory segment showed some brisk transactional activity totalling some S$370.0 million, led by the S$35.3 million sale of Lam Soon Industrial Building in May 2021. Prices generally picked up across tenures, averaging about S$415 psf as general business sentiments improved on the back of the steady global vaccine rollout (Exhibit 2).

Pharmaceutical giant Sanofi Pasteur announced in April plans to expand its footprint in Singapore with the development of a S$638 million vaccine production centre. Construction is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2021, with full operations beginning in 2026. The new facilities are in line with the government's plan to position Singapore as a regional hub for the healthcare and biotechnology industries. While the resurgence in COVID-19 cases at home and abroad has put a dampener on the recovery in the transport engineering cluster, the manufacturing sector continued to lead the recovery in 2021 as expected. According to the Economic Development Board (EDB), recent business sentiments in the manufacturing sector were positive, with manufacturing firms anticipating a favourable business situation for the second and third quarters of 2021. And as new reports indicate that the global chip shortage may be more protracted than previously anticipated, semiconductor manufacturers may be more sanguine in committing capital to expand production volumes, driving demand for industrial space. However, the considerable supply of new industrial space in the pipeline would likely keep industrial rent growth in check. About 56.1 million sf gross floor area (GFA) of new industrial space is expected to come online between Q2 2021 to end 2024, with 45.7% of the new supply projected to be completed in the rest of 2021. Although a significant proportion of the new supply consists of factory space, construction delays due to COVID-19 induced labour shortages and healthy pre-commitment levels for upcoming factory space may alleviate the impact on factory rentals, allowing rents to increase moderately between 1% and 3% for the whole of 2021.

This was largely attributed to the low base in Q2/2020 when large parts of the economy were shut to curb the spread of the pandemic. Compared with the preceding quarter, the economy contracted by 1.8% in Q2/2021, ending three consecutive quarters of growth since Q3/2020. The similar trend was also observed in the manufacturing sector. Although the sector extended its three- quarter expansion with a 17.7% YoY growth in Q2/2021, it nevertheless contracted by 2.5% from the previous quarter. This marked a signifi cant pullback from its 11.5% quarterly growth in Q1/2021. Nonetheless, Singapore's overall manufacturing sentiment remained buoyant in Q2/2021, with June's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) staying in expansionary territory for the 12th straight month (PMI: 50.8). Despite a slower rate of growth in May due to the impact of tighter COVID-19 measures on the sector, momentum in factory activity remained strong in Q2. In the same quarter, Singapore exports continued its growth trend from March. Coupled with the improving global economic backdrop and global demand for semiconductor-related products, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose at a faster pace of 15.9% in June. RENTAL MARKET Owing to the strong leasing interest for factory and warehouse spaces, the industrial leasing scene was more active in Q2/2021. Leasing volume1 was up 43.7% YoY to 3,381, far surpassing the quarterly average of around 2,400 transactions for the last fi ve years. From our focal group discussions with industrial market specialists, for factory space, it appears that more companies still prefer leasing to owning, especially the multinational corporations (MNCs). On the other hand, for warehousing space users, there is a mixed preference amongst users with sales and leasing demand evenly balanced. In Q2/2021, leases for multiple-user and single-user factories increased by 46.6% YoY and 43.0% YoY respectively, while that for warehouses went up by 30.3% YoY. Arising from strong leasing demand, vacancy rate of multiple-user factory fell 0.7 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.3% in Q2/2021, the lowest since Q3/2013. Despite an improvement in net demand, vacancy for single-user factory and warehouse segments remained relatively fl at from the previous quarter as new supply outpaced net demand. As the construction industry slowly overcome the delays caused by the 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). pandemic, more new completions come to the fore with some major projects such as Cogent Jurong Island Logistics Hub and Digital Loyang II data centre being completed in Q2. Consequently, this led to downward pressures on the overall occupancy level for the two segments. Industrial rents trended along with the demand across respective segments. While rents for multiple-user factories were recovering after a year of decline from Q4/2019, that for warehouses were starting to stabilise after rising for the last few quarters. In Q2/2021, JTC's rental index for multiple- user factories rose at a faster pace at 1.0% QoQ. Similarly, Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 increased by 1.4% QoQ to S$1.74 per sq ft in Q2, compared to the 1.1% QoQ increase in Q1. On the other hand, warehouse rental growth continued to slow in Q2, with JTC's rental indices inching up 0.2% QoQ. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, the average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics3 properties remained fl at at S$1.44 per sq ft. SALES MARKET Singapore's strata industrial market started to quieten down since early this year. Even though the total sales volume of 419 in Q2/2020 was signifi cantly more than 149 deals transacted in Q2/2020, the pace of sales growth slowed down in 1H/2021. Notably, number of sales caveats lodged for multiple- user factories declined from the peak in Q4/2020. Many industrialists, particularly the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs), are looking to acquire multiple-user factory spaces at a favourable price. Although some sellers are now more realistic with their price expectations, most buyers expect greater price reduction amid pandemic-led disruptions. As a result of a mismatch in price expectations, sellers rather keep the property for stable revenue income than to dispose at a huge price discount. For the warehouse segment, sales volume had remained stable since Q3/2020, the quarter when the number of deals surged after the economy unlocked a notch. There is still strong buying interest from both end-users and investors who are looking for industrial assets including logistics warehouse and cold storage facilities. Coupled with limited supply available in the market, investors see warehouse logistics as one of the attractive asset classes, which have a strong potential in the long run and appeal to users from various industries. 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.40 per sq ft.

Industrial prices in Q2/2021 continued to increase on the back of healthy sales level. From Savills' basket of industrial properties4, prices for freehold properties increased at a faster rate at 0.6% QoQ to S$705 per sq ft in Q2/2021. Savills' basket of leasehold industrial properties showed that prices for 60-year leasehold properties continued trending up with a 0.5% QoQ uptick to S$434 per sq ft, while that for 30-year leasehold properties ended a six-quarter decline with a 0.1% QoQ growth to S$292 per sq ft. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL The take-up for business park space was uneven across locations in Q2/2021. Notably, occupier demand in older clusters such as Changi Business Park remained weak, driving the vacancy level in East Planning Region up by 1.0 ppt QoQ to a record high of 18.7%. Even though the net take-up in prime areas remained at healthy levels, the vacancy level in the Central Planning Region (where the more sought-after Business Parks are located) inched up by 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 10.9%, the highest since Q4/2018. This was attributed to the recent completions in one-north, including Razer SEA HQ and Wilmar International, which are likely not fully physically occupied yet. As the overall rental growth for business parks were limited by the subdued demand in the older clusters, JTC's rental index for business park stayed fl at in Q2/2021. This was in line with the direction for average monthly rent in Savills' basket of prime business park properties5 and standard business park properties6. 4 Only include upper-storey strata-titled factory (single- and multiple-user factory) and warehouse units, excluding all ground fl oor units. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. They remained unchanged at S$5.76 per sq ft and inched up by 0.1% QoQ to S$3.97 per sq ft respectively. In Q2/2021, the occupier demand for high-spec industrial segment showed some signs of picking up and this could be one of the factors supporting the occupancy level of multiple-user factories (high-spec industrial buildings are a subset of multiple-user factories). Landlords of high-spec industrial space continued to see leasing interest from fi ntech fi rms, new IT start-up companies and creative agencies. However, as prospective tenants are still quite cost conscious, well-maintained older developments are competitors to these buildings. Consequently, landlords have been unable to raise their rents too much as prospective tenants are price sensitive and substitute spaces are available. As such, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket7 remained rather fl at with a -0.1% QoQ growth to S$3.48 per sq ft in Q2/2021. OUTLOOK Unlike the other sectors of the property market, the industrial and warehousing sectors have been performing in synch with exigencies that came about due to the pandemic. While the landscape for the other sectors of the market have been evolving 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. since the start of the pandemic, the industrial and warehousing market has in fact maintained a consistent storyline, one that is intuitive in nature and thus extrapolatable. After almost eighteen months since the inception of measures to contain the pandemic, the common themes that have been dominating the industrial and warehousing market have been supply chain disruptions and new economy demand. We have supply chain disruptions and the increased demand for healthcare related equipment driving the demand for logistics space. We also have new economy companies spearheading demand for business park and high-spec industrial space together with such companies that serve the online consumer market on the lookout for logistics space. These have been described in our Q1/2021 briefi ng and its currency still holds. The additional observation for the second quarter is that buyers have actively been looking for deals but sellers, especially those on 30- year land leases, though having lowered their price expectations are not willing to go down further to consummate a sale. In view of the recovery in the multiple-user factory market, we have revised our rental forecast from -3% to 0% to 2.5%. For warehouse and logistics space, we maintain our 1% to 3% forecast range.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Manufacturing to Steer the Recovery Course Despite Singapore's record full-year GDP contraction of 5.4% in 2020, the manufacturing sector grew by 7.3% yoy, driven by the outperformance of biomedical manufacturing, electronics and precision engineering clusters. The purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a barometer for the manufacturing economy, maintains its affirmative market indication of 50.5 points as of February 2021. Amidst thriving demand for semiconductor and digital processing solutions, manufacturing, along with information & communications and finance & insurance sectors, are poised to drive growth. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Singapore's economy is expected to grow by 4% to 6% in 2021. Sectorial Performance Continue to Diverge But Rents Show Signs of Stability City-fringe business parks rents recorded a marginal growth of 0.2% qoq, reaching $5.90 psf/mth in Q1 2021, amidst tight supply and demand from technology and biomedical companies who favour high-spec and well-located developments. On the other hand, outlying business park rents ($3.59 psf/mth) fell by 1.3% qoq, driven by lower rents at business parks at the west. Science Park rents ($4.23 psf/mth) registered a fall of 0.9% qoq. High-tech and conventional factory (ground floor) rents remained stable in Q1 2021, at $3.12 and $1.78 psf/mth respectively. Additionally, conventional warehouses (ground floor) and prime logistics rents remained flat in Q1 2021, at $1.54 psf/mth and $1.39 psf/mth respectively. The prevalence of retail, food and healthcare e-commerce will continue to drive demand for logistics spaces, while the accelerated digital transformation has sustained demand for well-located business park and high-tech spaces. Growing demand will be sustained by occupiers across technology, life science and logistics industries have largely thrived since the pandemic. For example, the warehouse capacity of GKE Corp was reported to be full at present and the company is on the lookout for additional storage space. Shopee also cited that it will need to build up its fulfilment capability, in areas such as warehousing and distribution centres. As such, prime logistics, city-fringe business parks, Science Park and high-tech factory spaces are expected to register growth in 2021 amidst prevailing megatrends. Influx of Supply Not Expected to Derail Broad Recovery Due to construction delays in 2020, there will be an influx of upcoming supply of 28.8 million sf (msf) in 2021. This compares to 2020's net supply of only 3.8 msf. However, majority of incoming supply in 2021 are single-user factory space (12.3 msf) and business park space (1.3 msf) which have been mostly pre-committed. Warehouse supply is expected to increase by 4.8 msf in 2021, higher than the 5-year average annual net demand of 3.9 msf. New warehouse supply should see relatively good take-up rates, amidst current strong demand in 2021. Nonetheless, conventional warehouse rents are expected to remain flat in 2021. Notably, there would be around 9.5 msf of multi-user factory space coming online in 2021. This could weigh on conventional factory rents, which are expected to decline by 1.5% in 2021.

This is a respectable volume considering there were no public sites transacted in the quarter.The residential sector was the outperformer, coming in at 37.8% of investment sales, with the sale of private sites and strong luxury sales. In an enbloc sale, three sites at Institution Hill were sold to a local consortium for $33.60 mil. In two other collective sales, 6, 6A, 6B Mount Emily Road was sold for $18.00 mil while Surrey Point was sold for $47.80 mil. For luxury sales, 18 good class bungalows were sold, and another 31 apartments above $10.00 mil were transacted, 20 units of which were from Eden by Swire properties and sold collectively for $293.00 mil. Coming in a close second at $967.46 mil was industrial sales, boosted by a portfolio transaction of assets injected into the Boustead Industrial Fund by Boustead Projects Limited. Other sizeable transactions came from the office sector; this includes the sale of a 50% stake in OUE Bayfront for $633.75 mil, and the $150.00 mil sale of CertisCisco Centre to a trust set up by Certisand Lendlease for redevelopment. Despite travel restrictions still in place, foreign interest in Singapore assets remain strong with funds still actively seeking out investments. Investment volume is likely to improvewith the rollout of vaccination programs globally, border restrictions easing, and business confidence returning.Although investors are likely to remain discerning and cautious, spurred by the low interest rate environment and ample liquidity, they will still be in search of investments that provide them with higher returns, coupled with stability and value at the top of their minds. Due to their limited stock, Grade A offices and shophouses will still be in high demand. CBRE Research believes that investment volume in 2021 is likely to rebound on the back of a recovering economy, led by residential, office, and industrial sales.

This stemmed mainly from Dyson Limited's lease commitment atSt James Power Station which was added into total office stock for Q1 2021. In the past six months, CBRE Research has noted an uptick in leasing momentum. In particular, the Grade A (Core CBD) market also registered positive net absorption, as occupiers capitalised on the declining rents and moved to prime office buildings. Demand came from firms in the technology and financial services industries such as asset management firms, and to a smaller extent, family offices. In addition, the displacement of tenants from buildings scheduled for redevelopment such as AXA Tower and Fuji Xerox Towers have contributed to increased occupier activity over the past few months. With more flight to quality movement, the difference in the Grade A and Grade B markets became more stark. Supported by the tight vacancy in the Grade A (Core CBD) market, the rental decline was arrested after four quarters of correction. In Q1 2021, Grade A (Core CBD) rents remained stable q-o-q at $10.40 psf/month. Conversely, the Grade B market continued to grapple with higher vacancy rates and the Grade B (Core CBD) rents saw a further rental decline of 1.3% q-o-q to $7.80 psf/month. Although there remain concerns around the existing pool of secondary space, healthy take-up of secondary space within the Core CBD has indicated that interest for such fitted out space remains strong. Going forward, demand is expected to be supported by employment gains, a gradual recovery of the economy and a tight supply pipeline. However, it will not be a uniform recovery; the Grade A market is expected to be the main beneficiary as large corporates leverage on the pull-back in rents for an upgrade in location and quality.

A negative net absorption of -35,817 sq. ft. was noted, contributed by the City Fringe submarket. Consequently, islandwidevacancy saw a marginal increase of 0.1 percentage points q-o-q to 12.9%.Leasing activity was relatively subdued in Q1 2021, with renewals and relocations continuing to feature. While leasing demand was led by the technology sector, expansions from other sectors have eased, as firms become more conservative in their take-up. Further, more downsizing by companies with portions of employees working from home could be expected as they recalibrate their space requirements.Some landlords are becoming more flexible in rental negotiations as they seek to maintain occupancy levels. CBRE Research noted a fall in rents for both the City Fringe and Rest of Island submarkets; the former saw a 0.9% q-o-q drop to $5.75 psf/month whereas the latter declined by 1.4% q-o-q to $3.65 psf/month.Amid construction delays, the pipeline for 2021 now totals 1.40 mil sq. ft. This may place some pressure on rents, in particular for the Rest of Island submarket with some projects in CleanTechPark slated to complete this year. In addition, the total future pipeline will further increase with the inclusion of Perennial Business City, which has yet to be added as it is still pending rezoning approval from URA.Looking ahead, the updated safe management measures at workplaces, which took effect from 5 Apr, is likely to lend support to renewals and gradually aid in the overall recovery of the business parks market. However, with many occupiers expected to adopt hybrid models for the time being, the return to workplaces may be phased out as companies relook at their workplace strategies and flexible working arrangements. Meanwhile, quality will continue to be a priority for occupiers looking to relocate or expand. Buildings with higher specifications are therefore expected to see greater demand.

MARKETVIEWRetail indicators have continued to show signs of recovery. Unemployment has declined, while with the return of shopper traffic, business expectations have improved. With the protracted closure of tourism borders, local spending has increased. Retail sales (excluding motor vehicles), posted a y-o-y change of -1.3% and 3.5% in Jan and Feb 2021 respectively, a marked improvement as compared to the pre-pandemic period. For Q1 2021, retailers from the F&B, convenience stores and supermarkets sector were seen to be increasing their footprint. At the same time, they have reinvented concepts, creating new and innovative brands to gain market share. Leasing enquiries from boutique gyms, beauty, health and wellness related sectors remain relatively active, although their decision making process are taking longer.It was observed that there has been a slowdown in rental declines of prime retail spaces, from -3.6% q-o-q in Q4 2020 to -1.2% q-o-q this quarter. Notably, landlords continue to maintain a flexible stance towards rental expectations and leasing strategies to support tenants' requirements, favouring tenant retention over occupancy.Even though demand indicators are improving, the retail sector has yet to reach full recovery; it will be highly dependent on the global vaccine roll-out and how soon Singapore can reopen its borders. With these considerations, the retail sector is expected to bottom out in late 2021. As such, the recovery of the retail sector is likely to be a gradual one, potentially from 2022 onward, given that the retail sector is still highly challenged by e-commerce competition and labour woes. The introduction of the Code of Conduct (effective 1 Jun 2021) is a much welcome change and tilts the scale to achieve a more equitable balance in the leasing dynamics. It seeks to increase the competitiveness of Singapore's retail sector, which will be timely as the economy recovers from the pandemic.

Preliminary estimates for new home sales volume for Q1 2021 came to 3,376 units, which was 57.1% higher than the same period last year. This was bolstered by the sales of Normanton Park (728 units), Midtown Modern (362 units) and The Reef at King's Dock (343 units), which were all newly launched this quarter. Q1 2021's performance also indicated strong demand for high-end homes among local homebuyers.According to URA's flash estimates, private residential property prices rose in Q1 2021 for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by increasing buyers' confidence, pent-up demand and the low interest rate environment. It grew by another 2.9% q-o-q in Q1 2021, after a 2.1% q-o-q increase in the previous quarter. This was mainly attributed to the RCR, which rose by 6.1% q-o-q in Q1 2021, a bigger q-o-q increase than the 4.4% registered in Q4 2020. Transactions at The Reef at King's Dock (median unit price of $2,257 psf) were likely to have contributed to the higher psf prices registered in the RCR. In addition, there was healthy take-up from earlier launches in the suburban market, which signifies resilient demand from upgraders.To date, private property prices have increased by 6.2% since Q1 2020. This also raises the possibility that more cooling measures could be rolled out. At this pace, it is likely to exceed the government's GDP growth forecast of 4-6%, while the launch of some upcoming projects at higher psf pricing might continue to push the price index higher.Although these projects are predominantly located in the CCR and RCR locations, smaller sized units which tend to have an affordable price quantum will still be attractive and palatable investments. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, CBRE Research expects new home sales to fall within the region of 9,000 to 10,000 units for 2021. In the longer term, the potential reopening of borders will also bring about the return of foreign investors to the residential market.

Manufacturing output rose by 16.4% y-o-y in Feb, following its 9.2% y-o-y expansion in Jan, supported primarily by the electronics, biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering clusters; while NODX similarly increased 4.2% y-o-y in Feb, extending its growth from the previous two quarters. SIPMM's PMI maintained its strong performance, posting its ninth consecutive month of expansion in Mar at 50.8.Leasing activity was stable in Q1 2021, albeit slowing down from the strong performance of the previous sector. Transactions consisted mainly of renewals and relocations, along with a handful of new set ups and expansions. In particular, the warehouse submarket continued to be driven from the third-party logistics, e-commerce and food logistics segments. Meanwhile, some leasing activity was also observed for hi-tech factory buildings, primarily from the semiconductor, precision engineering and technology segments.Both factory and warehouse rents tracked by CBRE Research remained resilient this quarter, staying flat q-o-q for both the ground and upper floors. On the other hand, as vacancy remained low and demand continued to be robust, prime logistics rents grew 0.7% q-o-q to $1.39 psf/month in Q1 2021.Moving forward, while the saturated factory pipeline may place pressure on rents, high-specsbuildings will continue to be in demand along with the recovery of the manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, the factory submarket remains two-tier, and older buildings may continue to weigh on overall rental performance. Meanwhile, warehouse leasing demand is likely to remain stable, with upcoming supply expected to be absorbed gradually by the market. However, external pressures remain; with the ongoing global pandemic, as well as the Suez Canal blockage which may have knock-on effects on global trade.

This is the first positive turnaround after three consecutive quarters of decline. The economy expanded by 2.0% qoq in 1Q 2021, compared to an expansion by 3.8% qoq in 4Q 2020. * Economic activities were ramped up at the start of the year as the economy entered Phase 3 of recovery from 28th December 2021. After posting a strong 10.3% yoy growth, the manufacturing sector expanded by 7.5% yoy in 1Q 2021. Clusters such as electronics, precision engineering, chemicals and biomanufacturing performed better than the transport engineering and general manufacturing clusters, which experienced output declines. As the construction sector gradually picked up due to public and private sector demand, the contraction moderated to a decline of 20.2% yoy in 1Q 2021, an improvement from the 27.4% contraction in 4Q 2020. * The services sector fell by 1.2% yoy in 1Q 2021, an improvement from the drop of 4.7% in 4Q 2020. Among the services sectors, wholesale, retail trade and transportation & storage fell by 4.1% yoy in 1Q 2021, a slight improvement from the decline of 6.4% yoy in 4Q 2020. Accommodation & food services, real estate, administrative & support services and other services dropped by -3.9% yoy in 1Q 2021 from -9.9% in 4Q 2021. The bright spot was the information and communications, finance and insurance and professional services sector which grew 3.7% yoy in 1Q 2021 yoy from 1.4% in 4Q 2021.

The labour market conditions improved slightly in February 2021, as Singapore's overall unemployment rates fell to 3% from 3.2% in January, signifying a renewed confidence by firms to add to headcount. The labour market has turned the corner for now due to the various job support/conversion schemes initiated by the government. * The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded in April this year its 2021 growth outlook for Asia to 7.6% in 2021, up from the 6.9% forecasted as of October 2020. Global economic prospects have also brightened although the rising interest rates in the US could translate into higher borrowing costs. * Business and consumer confidence are rising due to the easing of border restrictions and the gradual rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines. Apart from travel dependent industries, we expect most sectors to experience stronger growth in 2021. MAS estimates Singapore's GDP growth in 2021 to fall within the upper range of their official forecasted growth of 4 to 6%. Cognizant of ongoing global and regional risks, MAS has maintained an accommodative monetary policy, keeping the rate of exchange rate appreciation at 0% per annum. 2 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Market commentary Investment sales Total investment sales nearly doubled from $2.5bn in Q4 2020 to $4.8bn in Q1 2021 (Figure 1). This was likely due to the improved business sentiments arising from Singapore's Phase 3 reopening on 28 December last year and the commencement of the Ministry of Health's (MOH) national vaccination programme that was piloted on 27 January this year. The recovery in investment sales is also reflective of the gradual pick-up of the construction sector, which posted a more moderate contraction of 20.2% yoy in Q1 2021, compared to the 27.4% contraction in Q4 2020. The public investment sales market recorded no activity in this quarter, given that there were no sites awarded under the public land sales programmes. This was in part due to the government's cautious approach towards releasing sites for tender given the COVID-19 pandemic and the prevailing macroeconomic situation at the end of last year. Furthermore, land parcels released under the 2H2020 GLS programme were granted longer tender periods by URA due to the COVID-19 situation and would only be awarded from Q2 2021 onward. On the other hand, the private investment sales market witnessed brisk activities and recorded 156% qoq growth, from $1.9bn in Q4 2020 to $4.8bn in Q1 2021. This was led by strong performances in the residential and office sectors, which posted total transaction amounts of $1.8bn and $1.6bn respectively, or 39% and 34% of Q1 2021's total investment sales (Figure 2). For the remaining sectors, industrial transactions made up 19% of total investment sales, followed by retail and shophouse transactions, which represented 5% and 3% of total investment sales respectively. There were no investment sales in the hospitality sector.

Table 3: Investment sales summary Source: Various sources, EDMUND TIE Research 4 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Sector trends and outlook * There were three significant office transactions in Q1 2021, with the highest amount posted by the divestment of 50% of OUE Bayfront by OUE Commercial REIT to Allianz Real Estate for $633.8mn (Table 4). The other significant transactions were the sale of Certis Cisco Centre at 20 Jalan Afifi for $150mn, and 108 Robinson Road for $142.8mn. These key transactions marked a contrast to Q4 2020, where there were no significant office transactions, and point to a possible return of interest for the office sector given that with effect from 5th April 2021, 75% of staff can return to their workplace at any one time and working from home is no longer the default arrangement. * Industrial investment sales amounted to $897.4mn in Q1 2021, more than doubling the $375.4mn recorded in Q4 2020. There were three significant industrial transactions, namely the sale of 20 - 23 Rochester Park at $144.8mn, followed by BreadTalk Group's divestment of BreadTalk IHQ at 30 Tai Seng Street for $118mn, and AIMS APAC REIT's $102mn acquisition of Sime Darby Business Centre at 315 Alexandra Road. * For retail investment sales, the sole significant transaction in Q1 2021 was FCT's divestment of YewTee Point for $220mn to unrelated parties. The shopping mall has around 70 tenants spread over 74,000 sq ft of NLA. This transaction marked FCT's third retail mall divestment over three consecutive quarters, adding to the REIT's divestment of Bedok Point and Anchorpoint Shopping Centre in Q3 2020 and Q4 2020 respectively. * There were two significant residential transactions in Q1 2021. The first was the $293mn sale of all 20 units of Eden, a freehold luxury condominium by Swire Properties at 2 Draycott Park, to the members of the Tsai family of Want Want China Holdings. The second was the sale of a Good Class Bungalow (GCB) at 30 Nassim Road to a private investor for $128.8mn. Apart from these, the residential sector was abuzz with 10 other transactions greater than $30mn each in Q1 2021, of which 7 were recorded by GCBs. The stark pick-up in transaction activities in Q1 2021 relative to the previous quarter is indicative of the improving appetite amongst investors. As MOH's ongoing vaccination drive helps the nation achieve herd immunity against COVID-19 and consequently normalcy in the economy, investment activity could be bolstered for the rest of 2021.

Within the CBD and Non-CBD, there was a flight to quality by corporates. Due to the tight vacancies, premium grade office rents held steady in the quarter. In addition, with the impending redevelopment of AXA Tower and Fuji Xerox Towers, there is some leasing demand from the displaced tenants seeking to lease alternative office premises. The steepest declines were recorded in Raffles Place Grade A and Shenton Way/Robinson Road/Tanjong Pagar Grade B as vacancies rose. In the Orchard Road and decentralised areas, leasing activity was limited but rents were broadly unchanged. Office demand and occupancy rates * With effect from 5th April 2021, 75% of staff can return to their workplace at any one time and working from home is no longer the default arrangement. Even as more workers gradually return to their office premises, some employees have indicated a preference for work-from-home arrangements, citing productivity gains and reduced commute times. As a result, businesses remain cautious about expanding traditional office spaces as they deliberated on the ideal hybrid working model. * Major banks are reviewing their operations and shrinking their physical offices. It was reported that DBS plans to shed 75,000 sq ft at Marina Bay Financial (MBFC) Tower Three, while Standard Chartered is also considering giving up its space in MBFC Tower One. ANZ Singapore is also considering terminating one floor of its current existing space in Ocean Financial Centre in 2021. * Co-working operator Just-Co had recently announced in March 2021 that it will be opening another office in Tampines located at Asia Green, after an announcement for an expansion located in One-North (30,000 sq ft). Bridge+ by CapitaLand also opened another co-working office at 79 Robinson Road in January 2021, three years after the debut of its Bridge+ flagship co-working office in Ascent building at Singapore Science Park 1. * Based on EDMUND TIE Research statistics, overall net absorption islandwide declined from a robust 390,000 sq ft in 4Q 2020 to 74,000 sq ft in 1Q 2021. The islandwide occupancy rate remained stabilised remaining at 93.3% in 1Q 2021 (Figure 3). The occupancy rate in CBD fell by 0.4% pts qoq to 92.7% in 1Q 2021 from 93.1% in 4Q 2020. 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Location Subzone Grade 4Q 2020 1Q 2021 Qoq change (%) CBD Marina Bay Premium 12.03 12.03 0.0 Raffles Place A 10.26 10.06 -1.0 Shenton Way/ Robinson Road/ Tanjong Pagar Premium 10.86 10.86 0.0 A 8.72 8.67 -0.5 B 7.11 7.04 -1.0 Non-CBD Marina Centre A 9.65 9.60 -0.5 City Hall/Bugis Premium 10.72 10.72 0.0 * 7.01 6.98 -0.5 Orchard Road * 8.84 8.84 0.0 Decentralised areas Decentralised areas * 6.03 6.03 0.0 Table 5: Average monthly gross office rents (S$ per sq ft) Source: EDMUND TIE Research *Ungraded office space Outlook On the whole, we expect office rents to bottom out by the end of this year as the employment outlook improves. Even as major banks continue to downsize their office spaces, demand for office spaces continues to be fuelled by technology, fintech and finance companies. Singapore has been a regional base for Western companies and is now becoming a hub for Chinese technology companies. This is supported by the office expansion of Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance, as they ramp up the hiring process to recruit more talents in Singapore, especially talents who are trained in the technology sector. The recent announcement of Google co-founder Sergey Brin opening a family office in Singapore will buoy investor confidence in Singapore as a financial hub. We expect more businesses to sign on leases with co-working operators due to the flexibility and shorter-term commitments. As companies endeavour to accommodate their employees' preferences to work with some form of flexibility, the trend of co-working spaces might be preferred by companies looking for a change from traditional workspaces. Even for traditional offices, we are seeing a gradual transition to integrate more communal spaces for people to connect and engage in meaningful collaborations. Supply pipeline Based on EDMUND TIE Research, there are nearly 4.5mn sq ft of new office space that will be completed from 2021 to 2024 (Figure 4). Most of the office developments will be completed in 2021 (28.03% or 1.36mn sq ft) and 2024 (28.05% or 1.4mn sq ft). Close to half (47.2%) of the supply pipeline from 2021 (28% or 1.4mn sq ft) to 2024 will be in the CBD, followed by 32.2% in Decentralised Areas. The larger developments include Central Boulevard towers (1.26mn sq ft) which is slated to be completed in 2023 and an office/ retail development by SP Group (640,000 sq ft) located at Pasir Panjang Road and scheduled to be completed in 2024. 7 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL Market commentary Key indicators The manufacturing sector expanded for the ninth consecutive months in March 2021 and the PMI reading is the highest since March 2019. The PMI reading expanded by 0.3 points from February 2021 to 50.8 in March 2021 (Table 6). NODX increased 9.7% yoy in 1Q 2021, after a -0.5% fall in 4Q 2020. Demand and occupancy * Based on JTC's statistics, overall industrial net absorption increased from 1.2mn sq ft in 3Q 2020 to 2.3mn sq ft in 4Q 2020. The full-year absorption declined from 7.9mn sq ft in 2019 to 7.5mn sq ft in 2020 (-4.0%). In 4Q 2020, occupancy rates of single-user factory space, multiuser factory space, and business park and warehouse space increased (Figure 5). The two industrial segments, which saw the greatest increase are multi-user factory occupancy, which improved by 0.8% qoq and business park occupancy, which improved by 0.5% qoq in 4Q 2020. Rents * Based on EDMUND TIE Research's industrial property basket, monthly rents were broadly flat for most industrial segments in 1Q 2021 (Table 7). Although upper-storey factory rents fell by -0.5% qoq in 1Q 2021, it was a smaller decline compared to 4Q 2020 (-1.0%). * We expect hi-tech industrial properties to perform better than the other industrial stock due to the government's push for Key economic indicators 4Q 2020 1Q 2021 Key trends NODX (Yoy) -0.5% 9.7% * NODX growth was led by the electronics sector (14.8%) in 1Q 2021 while non- electronic NODX posted growth of 8.4% in 1Q 2021. The largest contributor was China, which contributed 15.3% to exports. This is followed by United States, which contributed to 12.8% in exports. PMI* 50.5 (Dec 2020) 50.8 (March 2021) * The higher reading is supported by a higher growth in new orders, exports and employment. The electronics subindex fell by 0.2 points from February 2021 to 50.6 in March 2021. This is the eighth month of expansion for the electronics sector.

Various major multinational firms have raised interest in developing facilities to develop and manufacture vaccines. Thermo Fisher Scientific will be investing $174 million, and their facility will be operational in 2022, the plant will manufacture a wide range of vaccines and therapeutics. Another global biopharmaceutical company Sanofi will be investing $639 million over five years for their new vaccine site, their first vaccine production centre in Asia, where construction is expected to start in Q3 2021. There has also been increasing focus on the environmental impact of industrial properties in Singapore, especially for data centres. Digital Realty recently opened its third and largest data centre in Singapore, which received the Building and Construction Authority's highest Green Mark Platinum certification. Moving forward, we can expect a shift towards more environmentally sustainable infrastructures, as companies increasingly adopt an ESG agenda. We expect industrial rents to bottom out this year, led by the high-tech and warehouse segment as the drive towards e-commerce and hi-tech manufacturing continues. However, the looming supply pipeline in 2021 will moderate such an increase. advanced manufacturing as Singapore prepares for Industry 4.0. In 1Q 2021, hi- tech industrial rents rose by 0.5% qoq. There has been a preference for modern specifications due to a rise in e-commerce, food logistics, and medical manufacturing. Older industrial buildings will likely see a decline in demand, resulting in a two- tiered industrial market. Supply pipeline * As of 4Q 2020, the supply pipeline from 2021 to 2024 is projected to be around 41.7mn sq ft (NLA). Approximately 53% of the pipeline will be completed in 2021, followed by 30.7% in 2022 (12.8mn sq ft). The hike in potential completions in 2021 was due to the delay in the completion of projects and new supply being rolled over from 2020. Multi-user factories accounted for the bulk (33%) of the supply pipeline (Figure 6). The larger multi-user factory developments in the pipeline are Solaris @ Tai Seng (929,000 sq ft) and Mapletree Industrial Trust located at Kallang Way (710,000 sq ft). With the excess supply of industrial projects in 2021, we will also expect to see more subdued rents for industrial spaces. 9 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH RETAIL Market commentary Key indicators * With the pandemic situation relatively well contained in Singapore, coupled with a stabilisation in the labour market, businesses and consumers have gradually regained a sense of normalcy. * Starting from 5th April 2021, the number of employees allowed to go back to work has been raised from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. This could potentially drive more footfall in the central area, as retail operators are largely dependent on the lunchtime working crowds for their business. * Traditional brick and mortar stores located in Chinatown ramped up digitalisation with a committee formed by IMDA, ESG and STB. Chope and Qoo10 have been appointed to assist the tenants to drive more sales and footfall into the area, by providing guidance and training on digital marketing. * Although the growth of e-commerce is set in motion, there is still a role for physical retail and placemaking activities, as consumers still need avenues for socialisation. * A set of guidelines termed the Fair Tenancy Framework Code of Conduct for Leasing of Retail Premises has been developed recently, which is set to come into effect from 1 June 2021. It is a set of guidelines to assist landlords and tenants of qualifying premises (which include, but is not limited to retail, F&B, clinics, and schools) to reach a fair and balanced position in lease negotiations. * The 3-month moving average retail sales growth (excluding motor vehicles) improved to -1.6% yoy in February 2021 from -5.1% in January 2021 (Figure 7). The Retail Sales Index improved 7.9% in February 2021, which marked the first month of growth since January 2020. This was driven by an improvement in consumer sentiment and greater shopping footfall. -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 Retail sales Index % Source: Department of Statistics Singapore Figure 7: Retail sales growth (Three-year moving average) (excluding motor vehicles) -60% -40% -20% 0% 20% 40% Department Stores Supermarkets & Hypermarkets Mini-marts & Convenience Stores Food & Alcohol Motor Vehicles Petrol Service Stations Cosmetics, Toiletries & Medical Goods Wearing Apparel & Footwear Furniture & Household Equipment Recreational Goods Watches & Jewellery Computer & Telecommunications Equipment Optical Goods & Books Others Retail sales excl motor vehicles Source: Department of Statistics Singapore Figure 8: Retail sales index (Feb 2021), yoy change * In February 2021, Watches & Jewellery saw the greatest improvement of 37% on a yoy basis, followed by Computer & Telecommunications Equipment which grew by 20% yoy (Figure 8).

However, due to the restrictions of large gatherings, this has resulted in lower demand for event catering. Restaurants expanded 6.1% yoy and performed relatively well as consumers took to dining out more frequently (Figure 9). Demand and occupancy * Based on EDMUND TIE Research, islandwide net absorption improved to 258,000 sq ft in 4Q 2020 from -538,000 sq ft in 3Q 2020.

Given the strong retail performance in Fringe/Suburban Areas, as a result of the catchment population and extensive work-from-home arrangements, rents have ticked up accordingly. Supply pipeline Based on EDMUND TIE Research, around 1mn sq ft of NLA is expected to be completed islandwide from 2021 to 2024. The bulk of the supply pipeline is expected to be completed in 2021 (39.0%) and 2023 (39.0%) (Figure 11). The majority (87.0%) of the supply pipeline will emerge from the Fringe/Suburban Areas. Outlook Following a series of closures by international brands, Abercrombie & Fitch is the latest international brand that is to exit from Singapore, as it closed its last physical retail outlet in Singapore and shifts to an exclusively online store. Retailers have to adapt to this new reality and the increasing shift towards online marketing platforms for the sale of products. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2021 2022 2023 2024 Orchard/ Scotts Road Other City Areas Fringe/Suburban Areas '000 sq ft Source: EDMUND TIE Research Figure 11: Retail development pipeline 12 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH RESIDENTIAL Market commentary Key indicators * Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) private residential property price index rose for the fourth consecutive quarter in Q1 2021, rising by 3.3% qoq, after an increase of 2.1% in Q4 2020.

We expect rents in the Orchard/ Scotts Road and Other city areas to trade sideways for the rest of this year amid continued border restrictions and flexible work arrangements. A bright spot would be suburban retail, which caters directly to the needs of residents in their catchment.

In a COVID-19 year, the resilient manufacturing sector played a huge role in cushioning the fallout on the economy, with substantial output expansions in the electronics, biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering clusters. Demand for electronics remains high due to the current global chip shortage. And with Singapore as a major manufacturer of semiconductors, chipmakers in the industrial sector may be compelled to expand existing facilities in order to increase output production. In March 2021, the Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) reported an expansion of 50.8, the highest since March 2019. The optimism among manufacturers prevailed in January and February where the PMI expanded by 50.7 and 50.5 respectively, indicating that the industrial sector is likely to see continued growth in 2021. 1The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in January and February 2021 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against October and November 2020) and y-o-y (against January and February 2020).

The multiple-user factory segment reported a healthy stream of transactions totalling some S$324.6 million, led by the sale of the Sime Darby Business Centre for S$102.0 million in January 2021.

This is expected to churn out up to 1,000 tonnes of fish a year. By 2023, the total output capacity would be 2,700 tonnes a year. Emerging as the main driver of national growth in a pandemic-stricken year, the manufacturing sector is in pole position to lead the expected economic recovery in 2021. This will be supported by the electronics cluster given the heightened demand for 5G technologies as well as the production of electronic goods that has been affected by the global chip shortage. Additionally, the transport engineering cluster might turn a corner with controlled travel envisaged to rise with the implementation of bilateral travel corridors with low to moderate infection rate countries, most likely in the second half of 2021. Moving forward, about 56.1 million sq ft gross floor area (GFA) of new industrial space is forecasted to be completed between 2021 to 2024. Of these, about 51.3% of the new supply is projected to be completed in 2021, with single-user and multiple-user factory space forming a significant proportion. While this might put pressure on the rents of factory space, more firms may expand their headcounts and the size of their facilities to cater for increased output production in light of anticipated economic recovery. Factory space rents might increase marginally in 2021, between 1% and 3%. Market outlook"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This turnaround occurred after fi ve consecutive quarters of decline. * Given the scarcity of such assets, prices of freehold properties remained resilient, inching up slightly by 0.2% to S$701 per sq ft. * Similarly, average prices across Savills basket of 60-year leasehold properties rose by 1.9% QoQ to S$432 sq ft. However, 30-year leasehold property values declined for a sixth straight quarter, falling by 2.5% QoQ to S$292 per sq ft. * With business parks facing challenges, evident from increases in vacancy, the average monthly rent in Savills basket of prime and standard business park properties contracted on a QoQ basis, by 0.9% and 1.2% to S$5.76 and S$3.96 per sq ft respectively. * While some of business park occupiers moved to less costly high-spec industrial space, the average monthly rent for Savills high-spec industrial basket also fell by 0.5% QoQ to S$3.48 per sq ft, after a 0.9% QoQ increase in Q4/2020. * With some industries are performing better than others, our rental forecast for multiple-user factory and warehouse space is maintained at -3.0% to 0% (multiple-user factory) and +1.0% to 3.0% (warehouse).

This came as a surprise as economists had previously forecast a contraction in GDP. The growth in GDP was largely attributed to continual expansion in the manufacturing sector of 7.5% YoY in the fi rst quarter, after growing 10.3% in Q4/2020, along with moderated contractions in the construction and services sectors. Output expansions in the electronics, precision engineering, chemicals and biomedical manufacturing clusters outweighed output contractions in the transport, engineering and general manufacturing clusters. Manufacturing sentiment continued to improve with the overall Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) in expansionary mode for nine consecutive months. In March 2021, the PMI recorded a faster rate of growth by 0.3 points from February to 50.8, the highest since March 2019 when the PMI was also 50.8. Similarly, the electronics sector PMI also registered its eighth straight month of expansion, albeit a dip of 0.2 points from February to 50.6 in March. Despite a global chip shortage which may aff ect consumer electronics, the electronics sector is still expected to grow on the back of higher demand for semiconductors. Moreover, external trade was also largely healthy, with non-oil domestic exports (NODX) recording a YoY growth for Q1/2021. In March 2021, NODX expanded by 12.1% YoY, stronger than February's 4.2%. Electronics NODX rose 24.4% in March 2021 from a low base a year ago, which was led by an increase in exports of integrated circuits amid strong global semiconductor demand and chip shortages. Non-electronic NODX growth accelerated to 9.4% in March 2021 after registering 3.2% in the previous month. This was largely attributable to petrochemicals, specialised machinery and pharmaceuticals. RENTAL MARKET The leasing market remained active in Q1/2021, with leasing volume1 increasing for a third consecutive quarter by 1.3% QoQ and 21.2% YoY to 2,950 transactions. Among the property types, leases of multiple-user factories increased the most, rising by 23.9% YoY to 2,320 transactions. This may be due to tenant relocations and renewal of leases with some downsizing due to cost-cutting measures. Apart from multiple-user factories, rental transactions of other property types also rose on a YoY basis. The leasing volume of single- user factory units increased by 14.3% YoY to 184 transactions while for warehouses volumes 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factories as well as warehouse space). grew by 11.5% from 400 in Q1/2020 to 414 in Q1/2021. Rental demand for warehouse space continued to be supported by logistics and e-commerce players as they looked to expand their operations, sourcing larger units to house their operations in a single location. The overall industrial vacancy rate eased for a fourth consecutive quarter in Q1/2021, albeit a slower pace of 0.1 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.0%, the lowest since Q1/2016, when vacancy rates were below 10.0%, at 9.9%. This was due to increasing demand as conditions in the manufacturing sector start to improve, as well as delayed completions. The QoQ decline of 0.5 of a ppt for multiple-user factory space outweighed the QoQ increases of 0.1 of a ppt in vacancy rate for single-user factory and warehouse space respectively. As the economic recovery broadens across various fronts, JTC's rental indices refl ected this with increases across all property types. The rental index of all industrial property grew by 0.6% QoQ in Q1/2021. Similarly, for Savills basket of industrial properties, the average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 rebounded, increasing by 1.1% QoQ to S$1.72 per sq ft. This turnaround came after fi ve consecutive quarters of decline and was led by the strong growth in the manufacturing sector. In the same light, the average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics3 properties continued to inch up further, albeit at a slower pace, rising by 0.5% QoQ to S$1.44 per sq ft. This was supported by strong demand for warehouse space from e-commerce, logistics, stockpiling and shifts in supply chains. SALES MARKET In the strata sales market, after two consecutive quarters of increase, sales volumes declined 21.6% QoQ to 366 in Q1/2021. However, on a YoY basis, the transaction volume in Q1/2021 almost doubled from the 196 recorded in the same period last year. Demand came from local fi rms such as those in the disposable Tupperware and frozen food processing business. Local companies which had in the past leased space are now willing to purchase as they see attractive pricing in the market. Many of the local companies buying have benefi ted from the fallout from the pandemic. The improvement in the industrial market was observed with the JTC price index of all industrial property registering a 0.9% QoQ growth for a second consecutive quarter. However, on a YoY basis, the price index recorded a decline of 1.3%. The 0.9% increase was largely led by a 1.1% QoQ growth in the price index of single-user factories, while multiple-user factories rose by 0.9% QoQ.

After four consecutive quarters of decline, prices for 60-year leasehold properties rebounded by 1.9% QoQ to S$432 per sq ft in Q1/2021. On the other hand, prices of 30-year leasehold properties fell for a sixth straight quarter, declining 2.5% QoQ from S$299 per sq ft in Q4/2020 to S$292 per sq ft in Q1/2021. More properties with shorter leases have been for sale in the market. Sellers of such properties do not see the need to hold on to their assets, particularly due to uncertainties arising from the pandemic. Separately, prices of freehold properties remained resilient, with a marginal QoQ increase of 0.2% to S$701 per sq ft. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPECS INDUSTRIAL After registering positive net demand for the past two quarters, net demand fell back into negative territory of -75,300 sq ft in Q1/2021. This was largely led by a decline in take-up of 161,500 sq ft in the Central Region. As a result, the islandwide vacancy rate rose by 0.7 of a ppt from 14.2% in Q4/2020 to 14.9% in Q1/2021, the highest since vacancy rates reached the 15.1% registered in Q4/2018. The increase was mainly due to fi rms moving out of business parks. While occupancy rates of new business parks increased in the quarter, older parks continued to face greater challenges in attracting or retaining tenants. Nevertheless, demand for business park space continued to emanate from technology and fi ntech fi rms which have thrived during the pandemic. However, for some fi ntech companies, they may still prefer to take up conventional offi ce space which imparts a more professional image compared with business parks or high spec industrial space. Although the JTC rental index for business parks recorded a marginal QoQ increase of 0.1% for a second consecutive quarter, the average monthly rent in Savills basket of prime business park properties5 registered its fi rst decline since Q2/2020 of -0.9% QoQ to S$5.76 per sq ft. Similarly, the average monthly rent of Savills basket of standard business park properties6 declined for a fourth consecutive quarter by a larger 1.2% QoQ to S$3.96 per sq ft as this type of space needs to provide greater fl exibility in rental negotiations to maintain occupancy rates. As companies adopt cost-cutting measures amid uncertainties from how the pandemic will pan out, some of the demand for high-spec industrial space came from fi rms moving out of business parks to high-spec industrial units, which are less costly (for older buildings) but still able to provide a respectable corporate look. Nevertheless, as with business parks, the average monthly rent for Savills 4 Only include upper-storey strata-titled factory (single- and multiple-user factory) and warehouse units, excluding all ground fl oor units. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. high-spec industrial basket7 declined by 0.5% QoQ to S$3.48 per sq ft in Q1/2021 after a QoQ increase of 0.9% in Q4/2020. With fi rms remaining budget conscious, older high-spec buildings may be better received by tenants. Demand for such space is expected to be stable in the long term, emanating from the technology, media and telecommunications and electronics sectors, which continue to perform well. OUTLOOK One year into the pandemic, driven by the need to buff er against supply chain disruptions, demand for biomedical devices and a global shortage of semiconductors, the industrial market continues to perform better than most other real estate sectors. The heavy demand for the products from the latter two industries have spurred on the chemical industry as well. Broadly speaking, the manufacturing and logistics sectors have two driving forces. One is knowledge intensive while the other is basically supply chain in nature. Between these two lie pockets of demand from the food industry and those who try to save rental overheads by moving to lower cost premises. How these two tracks will fare in the coming year will determine the outlook for the factory, warehouse and business park markets. Notwithstanding the broad vaccination program underway here, the pandemic has reared its head again with community cases spiking in late-March to the time of this writing. Overseas, the pandemic in some countries has been counted in multiple waves. So long as the threat of a resurgence in infections lingers, the demand for industrial space should remain fi rm. Remote working and the drive to achieve ESG (Environment Social and Governance) targets will spur demand for new technologies and materials. All these are likely to result in greater manufacturing activity in the semiconductor and chemical sectors here as most of the global companies have set up operations. The knowledge intensive industries are likely to continue to operate and even expand at the various locations earmarked for specifi c clusters. Local Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) are often not in such industries and their performance will be patchy. However, at a micro-locational level, they are likely to continue to look to set up in more central locations. The pandemic has decimated the industrial market in various ways. While the traditional users from industries such as oil & gas and ship building are still weighed down by problems which affl icted them prior to the viral outbreak, others who were doing well prior to 2020 are now starting to settle down to a lower level of activity. However, there are those who have not been faring well over the past few years, who have started to see their fortunes brighten. The following points highlight some of the observations that we have noticed of late. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. * Local Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) have been active in the quarter in review and are expected to remain interested in acquiring industrial properties for their own use. Examples of such companies are those in the manufacturing of Tupperware (mainly for export), processing of frozen food (the latter often needing 5,000 built in to 40,000-50,000 sq ft of land). These local enterprises are taking this opportunity where prices softened to acquire properties where the lease is often less than 30 years. The shorter-term lease means they can rein in non-production related capital expenditure. Food zoned industrial buildings and central kitchens located in the Central and Eastern parts of the island are still highly sought after. * Warehouse - rental demand from e-commerce (200,000 sq ft leasing demand). Companies in the e-commerce and last mile transportation industries have been actively looking for logistics space. A year ago, the pandemic was viewed with uncertainty and short-term leases for stock piling were popular. However, with the realization that COVID is not likely to go away anytime soon, these short leases have extended from half a year to a year or more. E-commerce fi rms have been sourcing in the Central and Eastern regions for space, often <100,000 sq ft. These are often around Kallang, Bendemeer and Tampines where easy access to expressways makes them more conducive for last mile delivery. They would have liked to lease larger areas but for the fact that most of the warehouse space in the abovementioned regions is smaller than in the West. For the Western region, as these areas have more warehouse space which off ers larger fl oor plates and higher ceiling heights, they are popular amongst tenants who require general storage facilities e.g. fashion companies, where there is less of a delivery time requirement. * Self-storage - Investor demand and rental demand have remained elevated. As they are the equivalent to co-working operators providing short term fl exi leases, they have become popular amongst tenants who have downsized from larger premises where lease terms are more rigid. * Light and high-spec industrial space - Tenants signing up for <20,000 sq ft in the quarter have been those from the IT, procurement and technology companies. For the rents charged, the look and feel of the buildings present it as value for money. * Business Parks - First generation parks are generally facing challenges. Counterintuitively, for some of the newer and well-located ones, there has been some resistance by tenants to Industrial 4 savills.com.sg/insight-and-opinion/ expand or locate there. Some technology fi rms with smaller spatial needs are fi nding Grade B offi ce space in the CBD to be an attractive proposition because rents for such buildings have fallen signifi cantly since the start of the pandemic and now overlap some of those charged in better located business parks. Although the performance of the industrial market is still mixed, we see that the worst is behind us. It is not that it is about to expand sharply across locations and types of buildings, but there will be PERIOD YoY % CHANGE IN MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY RENTS YoY % CHANGE IN WAREHOUSE & LOGISTICS RENTS 2021F -3.0% to 0.0% +1.0% to 3.0% TABLE 1: Rental Forecast For Multiple-User Factory And Warehouse & Logistics Segments Source Savills Research & Consultancy some that are growing whilst some still languish due to COVID-related reasons.
