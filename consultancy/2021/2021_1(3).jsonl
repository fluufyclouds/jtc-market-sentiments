Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Sustained Economic Growth into 2022 According to advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Singapore's economy grew 7.2% for the whole of 2021. The economy witnessed a strong rebound last year after 2020's record 5.4% contraction. Full-year 2021 manufacturing growth reached 12.8%, extending the 7.3% expansion in the preceding year. Singapore's economic expansion is expected to slow to about 4% in 2022. Nonetheless, 2022 expected growth would still indicate a solid economic recovery as it remains above pre-Covid-19 trend levels of about 3.1% GDP growth. New Economy Assets Outperform Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, there were steady increases in rents during 2021 for various types of industrial properties, except for outlying business park and factory space. Prime logistics and high-tech properties were the star performers, enjoying highest rental growth of more than 2% for the whole of 2021, bolstered by digital transformation and e-commerce adoption and outperformance of high-value manufacturing sectors such as biomedical and electronics. Rents of factories remained stable last year on the back of relatively tight vacancy rates, in line with Singapore's economic recovery. While city fringe business park experienced stable growth, rents of outlying business parks were weighed down by lower rents at older projects during the year. Nonetheless, outlying business park rents appeared to be bottoming out, inching up marginally by 0.1% qoq in Q4 2021 after several quarters of declines. Broad-based Growth in 2022 Positive outlook is expected for industrial rents across different segments. Rents for business parks in the city fringe are expected to continue rising while rents of outlying business parks could start recovering this year amidst ongoing economic recovery and newer business park space expected to come into the market in 2022. Similarly, demand for high-tech, prime logistics and warehouse spaces are likely to stay healthy given continued expansion from companies in pharmaceuticals, life science, technological and logistics sectors, fueled by the exponential growth in e-commerce and business digitalization. However, performance will be differentiated depending on their specifications. Newer and higher spec developments that are able to better meet evolving end-user requirements would lead growth while older warehouse stock would likely see stagnant rents. As such, we could see a slew of redevelopments to meet the needs of quality and higher specifications' demand. Occupancy rates of factory space could come under pressure in 2022 due to substantial upcoming supply in the pipeline. While majority of factory stock coming onstream in 2022 are single-user factory, which are already pre-committed, multi-user factory new supply is set to increase substantially in 2022 as compared to that 2021, based on latest JTC data as of Q3 2021. Nonetheless, demand for factories would be supported by continued outperformance in the biomedical, electronics and related industries and ongoing improvements in the general manufacturing landscape as the economy continues to recover into 2022. As such, overall factory rents could rise in 2022.

However, full yoy growth stood at 7.2% in 2021, the highest since 2010. * The manufacturing sector expanded by 14.0% yoy in Q4 2021, accelerating from the 7.9% growth recorded in the previous quarter. The services sector contracted by 4.6% yoy in Q4 2021, compared to a growth of 6.2% in Q3 2021. * Singapore attracted $3.7bn in FAI in Q3 2021, an increase from $3.6bn in Q2 2021 with the electronics sector leading at around $3.4bn. * MAS kept its inflation outlook unchanged on 25 October 2021. Singapore's core inflation for 2021 will likely come near the upper end of its 0 - 1% forecast and increase to 1 - 2% in 2022. Overall inflation is forecast to come in around 2% in 2021 and average 1.5 - 2.5% in 2022. * The labour market continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate declined marginally to 2.6% in Q3 2021 from 2.7% in Q2 2021. In Q3 2021, total employment contracted by 8,400, with construction (-6,600), food and beverage services (-2,100) and other service industries (-6,400) bearing the brunt. On the other hand, the information and communications (+4,000), and professional services (+2,500) and administrative and support (+2,000) recorded employment growth. * The road ahead is expected to remain uneven for various sectors of the economy. In particular, manufacturing and wholesale trade are expected to remain resilient due to external demand, although slowing Chinese growth does pose a key risk. The recovery for the aviation and tourism industry is also expected to slow due to the fresh Omicron threat. * With the country's high vaccination rate and the rapid rollout of booster shots for a wider age group, industries in the service line such as hospitality and food and beverage industry should benefit from an uplift in sentiment and easing restrictions. * On 24th November 2021, MTI announced that Singapore's GDP growth forecast for 2022 will be within the range of \"3.0% to 5.0%\" as more industries resume their activities progressively. As Singapore reconnects increasingly with the world and with the easing of borders, new areas of growth can be expected in terms of ramping up digitalisation and moving towards a greener economy. However, time is required to meet the manpower shortages in various industries, particularly the construction sector.

In addition, the transactions for office sales were predominantly strata-titled transactions. * The collective sale market registered strong activity with a consecutive string of sites launched for sale. A total of six deals were sealed in the quarter, of which three of them constituted part of the top five private investment deals. * The largest deal in the year was the acquisition of One George Street, a 23-storey office building, by a joint venture between JPMorgan Global Alternatives and Nuveen Real Estate for $1.3bn from CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust and FWD Group. The transaction was completed in December. * A joint venture between Hoi Hup Realty and Sunway Developments was awarded two freehold land parcels at Thiam Siew Avenue for $815mn via a public tender exercise. It was the largest residential development site sold since the previous round of property cooling measures implemented in July 2018. * Peace Centre and Peace Mansion, a mixed-use development, was sold via private treaty to a joint venture between Chip Eng Seng, SingHaiyi Crystal, and Ultra Infinity for $650mn. It was launched for collective sale in September. * Located at Shelford Road, Watten Estate Condominium was jointly sold to UOL Group and Singapore Land Group for $550.8mil via collective sale in its third attempt. * RESIDENTIAL: The demand for Good Class Bungalows (GCB) is expected to remain strong, though transaction sale volume may ease due to limited available listings. Given the fresh property cooling measures, developers will be subjected to a higher additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) rate of 35 per cent (including 5 per cent non-remittable) and are likely to adopt a more cautious approach towards their land bids. However, amid the tight unsold inventory of private housing units, developers may continue to turn towards the collective sale market to stock up on their land banks. * RETAIL: Amid the uncertainty brought about by the emergence of the Omicron variant and current restrictive safe management measures, investor sentiment in the retail market remains cautious. Prime retail assets are also tightly held, limiting transaction activity. * OFFICE: With the gradual resumption of the workforce back to the office, starting with 50 per cent from 1 January 2022, demand for high quality and green spaces will rise to suit occupiers' evolving requirements. The office market rental recovery has supported investment activity, which is expected to continue in 2022 amid tight supply and companies' realignment of workplace space strategies. * INDUSTRIAL: Industrial assets are anticipated to remain attractive to investors due to the sector's resilient performance and its growing importance accentuated by the pandemic. Amid rising environmental concerns, more investors will place their environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda at the forefront of investment decision-making efforts. 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH OFFICE - Quality office spaces fuel rental growth 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2021 2022 2023 2024 Under Construction mn sq KEY HIGHLIGHTS Average monthly gross rents (SGD/sq ft) SUPPLY - Singapore OFFICE SUPPLY (sq ft) OFFICE SUPPLY PIPELINE ( Q4 2021-2024) (sq ft) At Q3 2021, nearly 3.9mn sq ft of new office space will be completed from Q4 2021 to 2024, down from 4.6mn as of Q2 2021.

Prime office spaces in the central region experienced a positive uptick in leasing demand in the fourth quarter as companies prepared to work from the office in the new year. The occupancy rate for office spaces in the CBD rose by 0.7% to 93.0% in 4Q 2021. Amid flight to quality, Premium and Grade A CBD rents fell marginally by 0.1% in 2021 although overall CBD rents fell by 3.6%. CBD occupancy rate fell marginally by 0.1% last year; the market was weighed down in the first half of the year before sentiment stabilised. * With an improved business confidence in 2H 2021 technology companies and the financial sector, in particular the wealth management sector and family offices, continued to expand their office footprint and drive leasing demand. Additionally, with Singapore being a safe haven for global investors and international firms, companies are setting up offices locally in anticipation of a reopening of the workplace. * Another driver for prime office demand is derived from displaced tenants of Grade B office buildings, who are looking to upgrade to Grade A office buildings. With anticipation for employees to return to the office in 2022, employers are finding the right ways to entice employees to work from the physical office to enhance the company culture and drive innovation. * Some examples of leasing demand for the quarter are Shopee who is expanding their office into Rochester Commons, PGIM's relocation from One Raffles Place to CapitaSpring, Gojek shifting from AXA Tower to Suntec Tower 5 and Twitter's expansion into CapitaSpring from their current office located at CapitaGreen. * Moving into 2022, we expect flexibility to be the key theme for the office sector. Flexibility for employees working in the office and companies adopting a hybrid work approach in the long haul, as well as flexibility for tenants as they prefer more flexible lease options. Some companies may gravitate towards incorporating co- working spaces for the employees as an added amenity. * With office employment improving, companies are also looking to rethink and redesign their office space for current and future employees. Information and communications sector employment has experienced the most growth, followed by financial and insurance services. As the labour market for office employment gradually improves, the government has also been pushing to upskill workers to meet the market demands. * With Singapore progressing along with its Covid-19 endemic road map, we expect leasing demand to pick up further. In line with the changing preferences of occupiers, traditional office spaces are evolving to facilitate and encourage collaboration and brainstorming of ideas. * We expect a positive net absorption for 2022, with rental growth of likely 3% to 5% for good quality office buildings as demand continues to strengthen. We expect companies to acknowledge the importance of well-designed quality workspaces in facilitating business networking, employee collaboration and fostering company culture. With the redevelopment of older office stock and a tight supply pipeline in the year, vacancy is expected to fall, and office rents are expected to rise, led by the prime segment. 8 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL - Optimism for 2022 held back by Omicron 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 First-storey multiple-user factory Upper-storey multiple-user factory $ psf 70 80 90 100 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Single-user factory Multiple-user factory Business park Warehouse % KEY HIGHLIGHTS RENTAL OF FIRST STOREY MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY OCCUPANCY RATE OF MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY F i r m p r o s p e c t s f o r t h e manufacturing sector drove the slight 0.5% qoq increase in rent.

The overall manufacturing sector has now recorded the 18th month of expansion, albeit slowing growth amid concerns over the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and disruptions to supply chains. * On a 3-month moving average yoy basis, NODX grew by 17.9% yoy in November 2021, following a 10.5% rise in October 2021. Both electronics and non-electronics grew. * Overall industrial net absorption decreased from 3.9mn sq ft in Q2 2021 to 2.4mn sq ft in Q3 2021. possibly due to uncertainties surrounding global trade markets and concerns about cost escalation from fuel, transport, materials and labour amid disruptions from Covid-19. The drivers were multiple-user factory segment (1.1mn sq ft), warehouse segment (0.6mn sq ft), business park segment (0.4mn sq ft) and single- user factory segment (0.3mn sq ft). * Island-wide, the occupancy rate for warehouse increased 0.4% qoq to 90.1% in Q3 2021, whilst that of the multiple-user factory increased 0.1% qoq to 89.8% in Q3 2021. The rest of the occupancy rates for other industrial segments decreased, with business parks declining the most at 0.5% qoq to 84.3% in Q3 2021. * As of Q3 2021, approximately 27% of the supply pipeline will be completed in 2021, followed by 33% in 2022. Multiple-user factories accounted for the bulk (35%) of the supply pipeline with approximately 12.2mn sq ft NLA. Single-user factory space made up 29% of the supply pipeline, projected to be about 10.3mn sq ft NLA. * Amid robust manufacturing activity in Q4 2021, multiple-user factory rents rose by 0.2-0.5% qoq in the quarter. Buoyant demand for spaces with modern specifications pushed up rents by 0.5% qoq for hi-tech spaces in Q4 2021. For the full year, rents of hi-tech spaces rose by 2.7%, while multiple-user (ground floor) factory rents rose by 1.9%. On the other hand, upper storey factory rents fell by 0.3%. * Looking ahead, while the prospects for the industrial sector remain robust and intact, especially for high-specification logistics and factory spaces, the significant supply pipeline and other ongoing economic and business risks will cap the strength of the recovery. As major global economies prepare to embark on policy normalization, coupled with slowing China's growth and global supply chain bottlenecks, trade momentum could slow in the coming months. Businesses are thus expected to be cautious with their space requirements. However, we see firm expansion from firms in certain clusters such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, precision engineering and logistics. * Supported by Industry 4.0 and the e-commerce avalanche, new-economy assets such as logistics warehouses, high-specs industrial properties and business parks will continue to feature steady investment activity and fuel potential price growth in the near term. * Rents of industrial space are likely to grow between 2-3% for multiple-user factory space in 2022, while hi-tech factory and warehouse spaces will likely see higher rental growth of 3-5%. Even as demand prospects improve, the sizeable supply pipeline will cap the upside of rental growth. * Even as global Covid-19 vaccination rates increase and businesses continue to reopen, global growth is expected to soften for 2022. Furthermore, the spread of omicron infections may prove to be a wildcard going forward. On balance, the positive outlook for the industrial sector is tempered by some downside risks. 10 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH SUPPLY OF RETAIL SPACES (2021-2024) (sq ft) The i12 Katong mall has started to open progressively from Q4 2021, where six levels of retail shops will consist of about 180 stores.

The occupancy rate improved marginally by 0.4% to 91.9% in Q3 2021. In 2021, the occupancy rate grew by 1.5% points, mainly uplifted by the growth in the Fringe/Suburban Area. Rent for Fringe/suburban rose by 2.6% for the year, compared to a marginal growth of 0.1% in Orchard/Scotts Road and a fall in rental rates of 1.2% in Other City Areas. * The occupancy rate for the Fringe/ Suburban Area improved by 0.2% points to 93.8% in Q3 2021, the fifth quarter of consecutive increase since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. * Retail openings in Q4 2021 include GoldHeart at Causeway Point, Tsui Wah at The Heeren, Yakiniku Like at Sengkang Compass One and Don Don Donki opening at Tampines Mall. Retail closures include Omakase Burger closing all their outlets in Singapore, Food Junction at Bugis Junction and Ben's cookies at Wisma Atria. * The 3-month moving average of yoy change in retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) has fallen from 7.5% in August 2021 to 8.0% in November 2021. Retail sales for Petrol Service Stations, Computer & Telecommunications Equipment and Watches & Jewellery experienced the greatest improvement yoy in 3Q 2021. The majority of the retail trade categories experienced a positive growth except for Optical Goods & Books, Others and Departmental stores which are the top three categories that experienced losses. * For the food and beverage services index for Q3 2021, Restaurants reported the highest decline of 16.8% yoy, due to the dining restrictions. Fast food outlets recorded the most improvement increasing by 12.6% yoy in Q3 2021 followed by Cafes, Food Courts & Other Eating Places which rose by 5.7% yoy. * Northshore Plaza I, located in the Punggol Northshore district, has also opened. The new development features a supermarket, eateries, shops, childcare centre and enrichment centres to cater to the needs of residents in the area. * We expect suburban malls to continue their outperforming pace in 2022. With their curated tenant mix over the years, the malls are able to cater to the needs of the residential catchment, catering to the daily needs, which further encourage them to patronise the malls. As Covid gains acceptance as endemic within the community, retail sentiment will improve further and we expect stabilisation in the retail sector in 2022. Suburban retail rents will lead the recovery with around 5% to 10% of rental growth, while prime rents in OCR and OCA are also poised for a recovery in 2022. * D e s p i t e t h e p a n d e m i c , s o m e international brands are still looking for opportunities to expand their presence in the Singapore market, particularly F&B brands. Local brands, such as By Invite Only, The Editors Market and Bynd Artisan, have also expanded their retail footprint despite the pandemic. * Digitalisation, adoption of an omni channel approach and experimental retail are key trends going into 2022 for the retail sector. Retailers will continue to reinvent themselves and build their online presence, allowing their online and physical storefronts to complement each other. Malls will also continue to adjust their tenant mix, including securing unique and well-known international brands to entice more customers and increase footfall and spending in the malls. 12 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Q1 2011 Q3 2011 Q1 2012 Q3 2012 Q1 2013 Q3 2013 Q1 2014 Q3 2014 Q1 2015 Q3 2015 Q1 2016 Q3 2016 Q1 2017 Q3 2017 Q1 2018 Q3 2018 Q1 2019 Q3 2019 Q1 2020 Q3 2020 Q1 2021 Q3 2021 Residential pipeline Total unsold Years to clear unsold based on 3-year moving average for new sales per annum (RHS) Years '000 units 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 100,000 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Units RESIDENTIAL - Upward trajectory of demand and price attesting to resilience of the private residential sector 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 Q1 2011 Q3 2011 Q1 2012 Q3 2012 Q1 2013 Q3 2013 Q1 2014 Q3 2014 Q1 2015 Q3 2015 Q1 2016 Q3 2016 Q1 2017 Q3 2017 Q1 2018 Q3 2018 Q1 2019 Q3 2019 Q1 2020 Q3 2020 Q1 2021 Q3 2021 All Residential Price Index Landed Non-landed 1Q 2009 = 100 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 Q1 2011 Q1 2012 Q1 2013 Q1 2014 Q1 2015 Q1 2016 Q1 2017 Q1 2018 Q1 2019 Q1 2020 Q1 2021 Primary sales Secondary sales Residential launches* Units KEY HIGHLIGHTS PROPERTY PRICE INDEX OF ALL PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES RESIDENTIAL PIPELINE SUPPLY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SALES TRANSACTION VOLUME PRIVATE HOME RENTAL TRANSACTIONS In Q4 2021, based on URA's flash estimate, the overall Property Price Index (PPI) for private residential properties rose for the seventh consecutive quarter by 5% qoq. This rise can be attributed to a 5.4% qoq increase in the PPI for non-landed private properties and a 3.7% qoq increase for the landed private properties. The pipeline supply for private homes remained relatively unchanged, with a marginal decline of 0.6% qoq in Q3 2021. The total number of unsold units contracted by 11.6% qoq and we expect the units to be absorbed in 1.7 years (previously 2.0 years). Based on caveats lodged between 1 Oct 2021 and 31 Dec 2021, overall sales transaction volumes for private residential units decreased qoq by 9.3% in Q4 2021. The transaction volumes for both the primary and secondary markets declined qoq, by 15% and 4.7% respectively. The number of private rental transactions grew significantly by 11.9% qoq in Q3 2021, driven by the continual ongoing uncertainties within the construction sector, which created demand for rental units. On a yoy basis, rental transactions remained relatively similar with a total of 26,969 private rental transactions in Q3 2020. Q3 2021 26,759 units Q2 2021 23,923 units Q4 2021 (URA flash estimate) 173.6 Q3 2021 165.3 Q4 2021 7,377 units Q3 2021 8,973 units Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA * Residential launch data for Q4 2021 is based on new launches in Oct 2021 and Nov 2021 only.

Prices for the landed properties grew by 3.7%, while the non-landed prices by 5.4%. * Based on caveats lodged, new sales and secondary transaction volumes dipped 15% and 4.7% qoq respectively in 4Q 2021. Across the market segments, new sales volumes within the OCR witnessed decline of 50% qoq due to a sharp decline in launched units, while new sales volume in the CCR and RCR recorded qoq growth of 35.0% and 37.0% respectively. On the other hand, secondary sales volume recorded a more uniform decline of about 16.0% - 20.0% qoq across all segments in 4Q 2021. * Despite the dropped in sale volume, prices continued to climb. The price increase was observed across all segments in Q4 2021, with RCR registering the highest qoq price growth of 7.3%, while CCR and OCR saw an increase of 2.5% and 5.4% respectively. The RCR price growth was attributable to the robust sale of CanningHill Piers at an average price of $2,937 psf. * There were 4 new non-landed project launches, namely Cairnhill 16 (CCR), Perfect Ten (CCR), CanningHill Piers (RCR) and The Commodore (OCR). The robust take-up rate of 82.8% for CanningHill Piers attested to demand for RCR properties while nearly 75% take-up rate for The Commodore indicated the continual interest for homes in the suburbs. In contrast, Perfect Ten sold only 12 out of 230 units, as it was launched in the immediate aftermath of the 16 December cooling measures. * The pipeline supply for private residential homes as of Q3 2021 fell by 0.6% qoq to 52,101 units. Likewise, the total number of unsold units for Q3 2021 dropped by 11.6% qoq to a record low of 17,165 units for the period commencing from Q4 2017. Based on the last four quarters' sales pace of new units, it would take just 1.7 years to absorb the unsold supply, attesting to the tight inventory situation. * Non-landed rental transactions grew by 11.9% qoq to 26,759 transactions in Q3 2021. The growth in rental volume was likely fuelled by delays in the completion of the properties arising from the supply chain disruption, coupled with the return of expatriates/ students via the vaccinated travel lanes (VTL). The growth across all the market segments was broad- based, roughly 11.2% to 12.4% qoq in Q3 2021. * The strong sales momentum from Q3 2021 initially continued into the first two months of Q4 2021 but slowed in December on the back of the cooling measures and a limited number of new project launches. * With the imposition of the latest cooling measures to promote housing affordability and curb market exuberance, price growth is expected to moderate. However, we do not expect strong pressures on developers to reduce prices, especially for projects with limited unsold inventory. * Looking ahead, the tightening of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) could divert some demand towards suburban homes which are more affordable. We also expect some rotation of demand from RCR to OCR in 2022, given the strong price increases in RCR in 2021. * Demand will continue to be largely supported by local first-time home buyers and HDB upgraders, who are least impacted by the cooling measures. Stable economic prospects and an improving job market in 2022 will further support the demand for private homes. * However, sales momentum is expected to slow on the back of fewer units from new launches in 2022. Developers will likely exercise more caution in bidding for land parcels over the next few months. We expect a recovery in launch and sales activity in 2H 2022 if the collective sales market stabilises. * While the cooling measures will dampen sales momentum, the overall market remains supported by a robust labour market, ongoing economic growth, and healthy demand-supply dynamics in the property market. The nation is also better prepared to face new Covid challenges, given the high vaccination rates and booster programme. Our base projection is for a slight correction of primary sales to about 11,000 - 12,000 units for 2022. * 2022 will be a robust year for the rental market. With the VTL and resumption of air travel bringing more expatriates, foreign workers and students back to Singapore, we foresee rental demand to strengthen further in 2022.

The manufacturing sector posted a growth of 12.8% y-o-y, led by output expansions in all clusters, particularly electronics and precision engineering. The precision engineering cluster, being one of the critical industries that boost growth in the domestic manufacturing industry, provides components to a variety of businesses ranging from semiconductor to marine and offshore as well as medical technology. The government launched a three-stage digital roadmap known as the Precision Engineering Industry Digital Plan (IDP) to aid firms in the sector in identifying digital solutions to be adopted at each stage of business growth in order to thrive in an increasingly-digitalised world. In December, the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered a slight increase of 0.1 point from November to record an expansion of 50.7, marking the 18th straight month of expansion, albeit at a moderate pace as manufacturers remained wary of production and logistics disruptions arising from the Omicron variant. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in October and November 2021 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against July and August 2021) and y-o-y (against October and November 2020). In the fourth quarter, the island-wide median rent of multiple-user factory space increased by 1.6% q-o-q to S$1.79 psf pm, posting a continued q-o-q uptick in rental growth from Q3 (Exhibit 1). However, rental activity declined slightly as the months of October and November registered a total of 1,628 tenancies, 10% lower than the 1,809 rental transactions recorded in July and August 2021. On a y-o-y basis, this was nonetheless 4.2% higher than the 1,562 tenancies signed in the same period last year. In light of the expanding small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in Singapore, many have been on a lookout for affordable industrial spaces to locate their facilities. As such, this steady demand contributed to the increasing proportion of transactions valued at less than S$10 million. In Q4, out of the total 312 multiple-user factory caveats lodged at an average price of S$459 psf as at 31 December 2021, about 99.4% of them were of smaller- sized deals that are characteristically more palatable for this group.

Market outlook Singapore remains a key location for post-pandemic manufacturing Nor Adila Rahim Senior Analyst Research +65 6228 6856 nor.adila@sg.knightfrank.com Recent Publications INDUSTRIAL Q3 2021 SINGAPORE VIEW 24TH EDITION The global pandemic has changed the nature of various human and economic activities with a greater reliance on emerging technology coupled with an emphasis on sustainability and the environment. As new products have been borne out of the COVID-19 crisis stimulating the industrial sector, Singapore remains at the forefront of this evolution with investment from multinational manufacturers. American life sciences company Labcorp launched a new bioanalytical lab facility as an expansion of its central laboratory services in Jurong East, contributing to the capabilities of Singapore's biomedical ecosystem. Besides Labcorp, Thermo Fisher Scientific, BioNTech, Sanofi and GSK also announced investments in Singapore in the past two years. German multinational Siltronic broke ground on a new S$3 billion wafer manufacturing facility at JTC's Tampines Wafer Fab Park. This is its biggest investment in its history and its second 300mm fab in Singapore. The manufacturing sector led Singapore's economic recovery in 2021 as precision engineering supported growth in multiple downstream clusters such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, together with the electronics sector ramping up output due to the global chip shortage. Should overall recovery and health measures stay on the current trajectory of transitioning into a new norm, then barring any recurring waves of infections or new variants, the transport engineering sector might also turn a corner in 2022 as more borders open and travel volume improves. In the upcoming year, some 21.1 million sf GFA of new space is projected to come on stream across 2022, comprising 42.6% of the total stock set to be completed from Q4 2021 to 2025. As such, Knight Frank envisages growth in the industrial sector to continue in 2022, with investment activity likely to be driven by end-users looking for manufacturing facilities for their own use as well as Grade A warehouses that boast high-quality specifications which facilitate growing supply chain demand. The healthy demand and expanding activity in the sector will support rent and price increases of between 3% and 5% for the whole of 2022."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This led to a 7.6% YoY economic growth for the whole of 2021, showing a strong rebound from the 4.1% contraction in 2020. While the services producing industries grew by 5.6% YoY in 2021, the overall economic growth was led by the recovery (13.4% YoY) in the goods producing industries. The construction industry saw a robust expansion of 20.1% YoY while the manufacturing grew signifi cantly by 13.2% YoY. Singapore manufacturing sentiment ended 2021 on a positive note amid improving global economic conditions. Manufacturing activity grew for the 18th straight month in December, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inching up 0.1 point to 50.7. Singapore's key exports also continued growing for the 13th straight month in December, albeit at a slower rate than the previous month. Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose 18.4% YoY on the back of healthy demand for electronic products and pharmaceuticals. RENTAL MARKET The quarterly leasing volume1 continued to increase, rising by 4.9% YoY to 3,055 transactions in Q4. This brings total annual leasing volume to record level at 13,081, 18.8% higher than that in 2020. It was mainly lifted by strong leasing demand for single-user factory space which almost doubled from a year ago (+49.3%). This was largely driven by Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the electronics, manufacturing, and pharmaceutical industries, which require larger facilities for their business operations. The multiple-user factory and warehouse segments also saw healthy take- up from digital and creative businesses, as well as ecommerce and third-party logistics (3PL) companies. Compared with 2020 when leasing demand was largely driven by shorter leases to accommodate the surge in stockpiling, demand was more stable in 2021 as more industrialists committed to longer leases amid improving business sentiment. The vacancy rate for single-user factory and warehouse remained relatively stable in Q4, inching up by 0.1 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 9.4% and 10.0% respectively. With removal of 178,900 sq ft of stock, the vacancy rate for multiple-user factory eased by 0.4 of a ppt QoQ to 9.8% in Q4. Rents continued to trend up across all industrial segments in Q4, with JTC's rental index for factory and warehouse hitting a record since 2017. The Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). factories2 increased by 3.7% QoQ to S$1.84 per sq ft in Q4, which is 8.1% higher than a year ago. Savills' average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics properties3 also rose at a faster pace by 1.2% QoQ to S$1.46 per sq ft in Q4. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 remained relatively stable at 501 transactions in Q4, compared to 506 in Q3. This brings the total number of caveats to 1,922 for the whole of 2021, 52.1% higher than the previous year. This marked the the highest volume recorded since 2013. While most Multinational Corporations (MNCs) adopt an asset-light business model, many local SMEs were looking to acquire properties for their own operations. This helped to boost the demand for multiple-user factory and warehouses, especially from companies in the electronics, manufacturing, pharmaceutical distribution, ecommerce, and last mile transportation services. Although there was a gap between buyers and sellers' price expectations, buyers who need new facility with required specifi cations for their business operations were more motivated to commit to higher asking prices. Although there was some new project launches in Q4/2021, such as In Space and Citrine Foodland, industrial property prices continued to rise. In particular, the Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for freehold properties increased at a faster pace at 1.5% QoQ to S$721 per sq ft in Q4. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, the price of 60-year leasehold units rose by 1.1% QoQ to S$443 per sq ft. Savills' basket of 30-year leasehold industrial properties also showed a more signifi cant price increase in Q4, rising 0.8% QoQ to S$295 per sq ft. However, 30-year leasehold industrial prices are still 1.6% lower than a year ago. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL The vacancy level for business park space in the East Planning Region increased by 2.9 ppts QoQ in Q4/2021 to 21.5% largely due to reduced occupational pressures in ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee and Changi Business Park. Despite the completion of asset enhancement work for some buildings, it is nevertheless still challenging fi nding tenants.

Nonetheless, vacancy level in the Central Region eased by 1.7% ppt QoQ to record low at 8.5% due to stock removal for redevelopment of 1 Science Park Drive, bringing the islandwide vacancy level down 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 15.5% in Q4. The limited availability of space and constant demand in Mapletree Business City and one- north regions continued to support rental growth, driving Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents up by 0.9% QoQ to S$5.86 per sq ft in Q4, 0.8% above that a year ago. Savills' standard business park properties' monthly rents remained in recovery mode, rising by 0.4% QoQ to S$4.01 per sq ft in Q4, the same rental level as a year ago. However, the rental growth could be attributed to the REIT-owned properties which held their rents up while off ering other incentives such as Capital Expenditure (CapEx) allowance or rent- free period. While there was some spill-over of demand from high-spec industrial spaces to Grade B offi ces, some new high-spec industrial developments such as UBIX saw healthy commitment rate. Coupled with the strong demand in some prime high-spec industrial developments, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket increased by 0.7% QoQ to S$3.56 per sq ft in Q4, albeit at a moderated pace compared with the 1.7% QoQ rate achieved in Q3. OUTLOOK Singapore was set for an economic recovery in the beginning of the year, largely driven by the manufacturing sector. However, elevated oil and energy prices caused by Russia's attack on Ukraine are expected to have an impact on the electricity 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. temperature-controlled facilities. This is fuelled by manufacturers gearing up for a post-pandemic future where supply chains will have to be increasingly nimble. Notably, due to the pivot to Industry 4.0, landlords of older developments are likely to take the opportunity to embark on asset enhancement initiatives and redevelopment works to remain relevant. Nonetheless, the supply of modern industrial facilities with quality specifi cations is expected to remain limited in the near term because of construction delays. If infl ation, which was already high, catalysed by supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, gets further boosted by the Ukrainian confl ict, it may spur companies to purchase their own properties or sign long term leases. Although the prospect of stagfl ation may set in, the situation we have now could create the conditions for industrial/warehousing rents and prices to rise despite the economy not performing well. Taking the abovementioned factors into account, rent for prime multiple-user factory and warehouse & logistics properties is forecast to grow by up to 2% and 3% respectively in 2022.

The Russia-Ukraine confl ict will further strain global manufacturing and supply chains as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of commodities such as wheat, nickel and palladium. This could in turn lead to another wave of disruption and stockpiling. A protracted confl ict will aff ect business confi dence and weigh on global economies and impact their recovery from the pandemic. Despite the global headwinds, industrial and logistics are likely to remain as a favoured real estate sector. In light of operational constraints amid the pandemic, many businesses intensifi ed their eff orts to embrace advanced manufacturing, adopt new technology and upskill their workforce. Some initiatives to address the accelerated structural shifts resulting from COVID-19 include the digitalisation of warehousing operations and automation of production lines to cope with fl uctuations in demand.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast A better-than-expected economic performance Singapore's economy grew by 14.7% yoy in Q2 2021, much faster than the 1.5% growth in the previous quarter. Growth was continuingly led by manufacturing sector that expanded by 17.7% yoy in Q2 2021. Overall unemployment rate has also improved, coming down from 3% for the whole of 2020 to 2.9% in Q1 2021 and 2.7% in Q2 2021. Amidst a strong global economic recovery and accelerated vaccination programmes in key advanced economies, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on 11 August 2021 upgraded its GDP growth forecast range for 2021 to 6%- 7% from 4%-6% previously forecasted. Rents remained stable across most segments Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, rents of city fringe business park, prime logistics, warehouse and factory space remained stable in Q3 2021 as vacancy rates stayed tight alongside economic recovery. Science Park rents ($4.27 psf/mth) registered a rise of 0.5% qoq, extending the growth in the previous quarter. Similarly, high-tech rents continued to increase by 0.3% qoq in Q3 2021. COVID-19 could have accelerated the digital adoption by manufacturers and industrialists. This coupled with the government's push towards advanced manufacturing activities has supported demand for higher specification industrial developments. On the other hand, outlying business park rents ($3.54 psf/mth) fell by 0.9% qoq, weighed down by lower rents achieved by older developments. Nonetheless, the rates of rental decline have been moderated for the past two quarters of 2021 as compared to that in 2020, indicating that rents of outlying business park are likely to bottom out soon amid relatively limited supply of new business park space. Recovery is well underway Rental growth registered across different types of industrial properties in the first nine months of 2021 has reflected the expansion seen in the manufacturing sector - a key pillar of Singapore's economy. The ongoing global chip shortage could lead to semiconductor manufacturers being more confident in committing capital to increase production volumes, increasing demand for factory space. Increased flow of biotechnology investments into Singapore as well as possible expansion from technology and logistics firms, which have been riding well on the exponential growth in e-commerce and business digitalization, could drive up demand for high-tech and prime logistics space. In Q3 2021, healthy demand amid moderate supply of prime logistics space has further tightened their vacancy rates, which are anticipated to remain low in the upcoming quarters. On the other hand, despite expected robust demand, occupancy rates of factory space could come under pressure in the latter part of 2021 and 2022 given the influx of new multi-user factory stock coming onstream after the year-long construction delays. Nevertheless, sustained uptrend in factory rents is expected, albeit tempered, underpinned by strong manufacturing output growth and progressive re-opening of the economy. Similarly, city fringe business park and warehouse rents are projected to continue rising. E-commerce needs together with vaccine and food storage requirements remain as key demand drivers for warehouse and prime logistics space in the near future.

On a quarter-on- quarter (q-o-q) seasonally-adjusted basis, Singapore's economy actually contracted by 1.8% in Q2 2021, compared to the 3.3% q-o-q expansion recorded in the first quarter of 2021. Manufacturing continued to drive the recovery in Singapore, as semiconductor manufacturers and sub-contractors supporting electronics firms reaped the benefits of the global chip shortage. The precision engineering and electronics clusters recorded 24.3% and 18.3% y-o-y growth respectively. These numbers were overshadowed by the impressive growths seen in the transport engineering and chemicals clusters, which recorded 29.6% and 20.1% y-o-y growth respectively, although this was largely the result of the low base effects in 2020. In September, the Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) recorded an expansion of 50.8 representing 15 consecutive months of expansion for the industrial sector, but a slight decline from the two-year high of 51.0 recorded in July. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in July and August 2021 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against April and May 2021) and y-o-y (against July and August 2020).

Monthly rental activity remained strong, recording a total of 1,809 rental transactions in July and August, representing an increase of 14.7% y-o-y from the 1,577 rental transactions in the same period last year, and a marginal increase of 0.4% from the 1,801 transactions in April and May 2021. Transactional activity in the multiple- user factory segment hit a lull in Q3 2021, with transactions totalling some S$309.5 million, led by the S$11 million sale of a 10,000-sf freehold strata unit in Ann Chuan Industrial Building. Prices generally remained stable in Q3 2021, averaging about S$414 psf on the back of sustained industrial activity (Exhibit 2). Although recent transactions have generally comprised properties with smaller quantums, more sizable deals are in the works. According to the Knight Frank Capital Markets team, larger sellers are taking advantage of improving industrial market sentiments to carry out previously planned asset disposals, using the opportunity to liquidate underutilised industrial properties. Despite the uptick in interest, it might take some time for such transactions to be reflected as these typically take around 10 to 12 months to complete.

Market outlook In accordance with the government's bid to produce 30% of Singapore's nutritional needs domestically, further investments were made in the domestic food and agri- tech industries. In September, top Japanese egg producer ISE Food Holdings signed a memorandum of understanding with the Singapore Food Agency to invest S$100 million to build Singapore's fourth egg farm. Construction is expected to begin in 2022, with facilities progressively opening from 2024 onwards. Alternative protein production also continued to gain traction in Singapore in Q3. Esco Aster, a Singaporean contract development and manufacturing organisation, gained approval and started production of cell-cultured chicken at their Ayer Rajah Crescent facility in July. In the same vein, Chinese biotech firm Avant announced the development of a pilot production facility for cultivated fish cells in September. The research laboratory will be located in Biopolis and is expected to begin operations by 2022. Growing food in urban Singapore Sustained demand for pandemic- era goods, such as bio-technology components, healthcare and sanitary goods, as well as electronics components for the pandemic-induced digital transformation, will continue to draw high-value-added manufacturing investment to Singapore. While the amount of upcoming industrial space has dropped to 53.0 million sf gross floor area (GFA) by end 2025, new supply remains substantial, with 18.8 million sf GFA and 17.3 million sf GFA expected to complete in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Nevertheless, healthy sustained demand and strong global manufacturing investment interest should allow rents to increase moderately between 1% and 3% for the whole of 2021 as expected. As Singapore stabilises from the fallout of the pandemic, factory prices and rents could potentially increase by 3% to 5% in 2022. $0 $100 $200 $300 $400 $500 $600 $700 $800 $900 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Benedict Yeo Executive Research +65 6228 6837 benedict.yeo@sg.knightfrank.com Recent Publications INDUSTRIAL Q2 2021 SINGAPORE VIEW 24TH EDITION Q3**"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

For the quarter in review, even though all industries registered YoY growth, momentum eased across the board. The manufacturing sector grew by 7.5% YoY in Q3, down from 18.0% YoY in Q2. The electronics and precision engineering clusters remained the main drivers, supported by sustained global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. The growth in Singapore's manufacturing activity also slowed slightly in August and September, with the Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) falling from 51.0 in July to 50.8 in September. Nonetheless, Singapore's factory sector has remained in positive territory for 15 consecutive months, owing to the resilient electronics sector. Singapore exports rose for a 10th straight month in September, up by 12.3% from a year ago. The growth was led by the petrochemicals, specialised machinery and pharmaceutical segments. RENTAL MARKET The leasing market saw its highest level of activity in Q3/2021, with total leasing volume1 rising 13.9% YoY to 3,423. The number of leases increased across all segments, especially for single-user factory (+77.8% YoY) and warehouse spaces (+21.7% YoY). Even though there was greater buying interest for single-user factory facilities for own use, leasing deals continued to climb in Q3 as there is still some mismatch between buyers and sellers' price expectations. The warehouse segment also saw strong take- up from industries such as ecommerce, electronics and third-party logistics. Despite a slower growth (+8.1% YoY) compared with other segments, the number of tenancies for multiple-user factory units is still on the high side. This was largely led by digital and creative businesses which are expanding their real estate footprint, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises in agricultural, plastic and metal manufacturing businesses. In terms of physical occupation, arising from new completions in the West Planning Region, the vacancy rate for single-user factory space rose 0.2 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 9.3% in Q3. However, with a relatively stable net take-up of 1.1 million sq ft, vacancy for multiple-user factories slipped by 0.1 of a ppt QoQ to 10.2%, the lowest since Q3/2013. For the warehouse segment, occupier demand in the West Planning Region remained healthy, with larger fi rms taking up signifi cant space in Tuas due to a lack of ready-built ramp-up facilities in other 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). parts of the island. Despite an addition of 111,000 sq ft of new warehouse stock in the region, vacancy in the West Planning Region managed to ease 0.3 of a ppt QoQ to 9.8% in Q3. The vacancy rate in the East Planning Region also fell 1.1 ppt QoQ to 7.8% in Q3, the lowest since Q1/2016. This was attributed to strong take-up from warehousing and logistics needs arising from ecommerce and consolidation of supply chains. Compared with Q2, industrial rents continued to post positive growth in Q3/2021. Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 registered a third consecutive quarterly increase of 1.7% QoQ to S$1.77 per sq ft. After witnessing no growth in Q2, Savills' average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics3 properties inched up by 0.3% QoQ to S$1.44 per sq ft, reaching its highest level since Q3/2014. SALES MARKET After some signs of slowing down in the fi rst half of this year, strata industrial sales activity started to pick up momentum in Q3. Sales volume4 increased by 3.7% QoQ to 472, bringing the total number of caveats to 1,387 over the fi rst three quarters. This has already surpassed the annual average of 1,206 for the last three years. The sales growth could be backed by buyers who are keen to purchase private properties as they do not have to go through stringent application procedures with JTC when buying public industrial properties. Moreover, they are also looking for capital appreciation potential from private property acquisition as these properties generally have longer lease tenures than JTC properties, with some even being freehold. Sales activity for multiple-user factory and warehouse spaces continued to pick up in Q3, rising by 4.6% and 35.7% QoQ respectively. While demand in the Central and North Planning Region stayed strong, there was an uptick in sales demand for multiple-user factory in the West Planning Region after a decline in the previous quarter. For the warehouse segment, most users within the West Planning Region tend to lease as they usually require large ramp-up facilities which are limited in the sales market. As such, the majority of the warehouse sales demand came from the Central Planning Region where smaller warehouse spaces are required for last mile delivery services. Interested buyers for single-user factories are still on the lookout, but very few translated into actual sales because of the price gap between buyers and sellers. As such, the sales volume for single-user factory spaces continued to fall by 34.4% QoQ in Q3. 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.40 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 15 November 2021.

As a result, Savills' basket of leasehold industrial properties showed that prices for freehold properties increased at a faster rate of 0.6% QoQ to S$710 per sq ft in Q3. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, 60-year leasehold prices rose by 1.0% QoQ to S$438 per sq ft. For the quarter in review, this was because sellers are more willing to negotiate prices before their leases deplete further, and buyers are looking for good deals with reasonable remaining leases. Compared with Q2, Savills' basket of leasehold industrial properties showed that prices for 30-year leasehold properties remained stable with a 0.1% increase to S$292 per sq ft in Q3. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL Arising from the tight supply and steady demand in the Mapletree Business City and one-north regions, the vacancy level for business park space in the Central Planning Region eased by 0.7 of a ppt in Q2 to 10.2% in Q3. As a result of improving occupancy levels, prospective tenants are accepting higher rents for these prime locations, driving Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents up by 0.7% QoQ to S$5.80 per sq ft in Q3. After registering a record high vacancy level of 18.7% in Q2 due to a dip in demand in Changi Business Park, vacancy in the East Planning Region remained almost unchanged at 18.6% in Q3. On the other hand, vacancy in the West Planning Region spiked from 25.1% in Q2 to 30.0% in Q3. Even though vacancy for International Business Park only saw a marginal increase of 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 25.5%, the addition of new stock from the newly completed Cleantech Three put pressure on the overall occupancy in the West. Nonetheless, rents in the older business park clusters are starting to show signs of bottoming out, with Savills' standard business park properties6 monthly rents recovering by 0.5% QoQ to S$3.99 per sq ft in Q3. Overall sentiment remained mixed in the high-spec industrial leasing market. In the face of the accelerated pace of digital transformation, there is still demand from technology fi rms, as well as creative agencies which support ecommerce activity. However, as Grade B offi ce rents have reached a level where the rental gap between them and prime high-spec industrial spaces have narrowed considerably, more businesses that need quality spaces with a central location to maintain their corporate image are considering moving to Grade B offi ces. While landlords of prime high-spec industrial 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. spaces who have maintained their rental expectations (high-S$4 psf per month) faced slow take-up, owners of less prime or older high-spec industrial spaces who are willing to off er more aff ordable rents (around S$3 psf per month) continue to register good take-up. Nevertheless, selected developments have been attracting healthy demand and driving overall rental growth. In the reviewed quarter, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket7 went up by 0.8% QoQ to S$3.51 per sq ft. Having inserted the recently completed 351 on Braddell development into Savills' high-spec industrial basket, monthly rents increased by 1.7% QoQ to S$3.54 per sq ft in Q3. OUTLOOK The outlook of the industrial and logistics market will be impacted by micro and macro events. The former involves emerging industries which are taking root here. Notwithstanding the surge in supply in 2022, the overall occupancy rate is likely to stay unchanged as the increase could be matched by strong demand from these industries. Especially with a greater emphasis on healthcare, technology and digital transformation, new economy sectors such as biomedical sciences, digital and technology, continue to expand in Singapore. The vacancy level in areas like one-north are likely to remain tight with demand coming from companies engaged in technology and biomedical research and development (R&D). This has not gone unnoticed amongst landlords and 1 Science Park Drive is set to be redeveloped into a life science and innovation campus. Scheduled to complete by Q2/2025, the new campus will comprise three interconnected Grade 'A' buildings with over 1.2 million sq ft of new business park space. Around 860,000 sq ft, accounting for 71% of the total business park space, will be allocated for wet labs to accommodate biomedical R&D activities. Going forward, rents for prime business park space are likely to be lifted upon completion of such rejuvenation of older business park developments. On the macro front, while the disruptions wrought by SARs-CoV-2 continue to affl ict the offi ce, retail and hospitality sectors, industrial and warehousing continue to push against the tide of negativism. In fact, the uncertainty levels across many of the economic sectors are benefi tting these sectors. In the quarters ahead, the ramping up of economic activity in major commodity producing and manufacturing export powerhouses will continue to be plagued by supply chains problems. The supply side struggles to sate the demand for consumer goods which are continuing to break records as developed economies begin unlocking themselves from a prolonged period of 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft.

During the period of pandemic isolation, consumers got addicted to ecommerce, spurring demand for consumption goods. Within the supply chain industry, issues ranged from crews of container ships suff ering from burn out syndrome having remained for months onboard container carriers and prevented from on-shore visits due to strict pandemic measures; major ports becoming choke points as they lacked the effi ciencies of the Amazonian order taking-distribution process during a time when ecommerce is experiencing exponential growth; modern container ships are now two or three times bigger than they were 10 to 15 years ago, creating a chokepoint during offl oading; a shortage of truck drivers and a bunching up of containers in inland depots or stacking up at cargo ports. This year's Black Friday (November 26) and the year-end festive season will compound the COVID induced logjam further. That is not the end of the story. The rollout of new consumer products has driven up the demand for semiconductors. Before the start of the pandemic, the world was already in a tech boom. The strict lockdown measures in 2020 and 2021 threw both supply and demand badly off kilter. Across the board, primary and secondary inputs to the manufacturing process are seeing sharp increases in prices. Graphs 4 and 5 show that from the shipping cost of a 40-foot container to semiconductor prices, since 2019, all have increased substantially. Even crude oil prices are about 50% higher than they were at the start of 2019. For gains like wheat and corn, although global prices are not at record levels, they are closing in on their respective seven to eight-year highs. Today, both supply chain and semiconductor industry experts appear to hold the view that chaos in their respective markets will only be resolved by early-2023. The upshot of this logjam is infl ation and how long this will last will have a direct impact on our industrial and warehousing sectors. Infl ation is given a boost when in the US, money supply growth is still at rates signifi cantly higher than pre-pandemic times (please refer to Graph 6). Also, consumer credit there has been rising strongly on an annual basis with no signs of a let up in demand because salaries in Q3/2021 increased by 1.5% QoQ, the highest in 20 years. Nevertheless, it must be added that while demand in developed economies is growing, the constraints are building to a point where it has begun to hinder expansion. This would cap global GDP growth. However, even if economic growth tapers, it may not impact the industrial and logistics sector globally because the need to stockpile has become paramount. The same is true for Singapore but the reason has a slight twist. The litany of problems confronting major economies originated from the large production and end-demand countries, for example US consumer demand shot up due to pent up demand as states started to loosen movement restrictions, ports and semiconductor plants shut down during the pandemic etc. Their impact on Singapore is one where businesses supply to the domestic market needs to take account of the uncertainties surrounding supply and prices. The need to smooth over supply hiccups and combat infl ation should therefore lead to greater demand for warehouse space. If infl ation becomes endemic, besides hedging against future price increases by stockpiling merchandise, expect businesses to also attempt PERIOD YoY % CHANGE IN MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY RENTS YoY % CHANGE IN WAREHOUSE & LOGISTICS RENTS 2021F 2.5% to 4.5% 1.0% to 3.0% 2022F 1.0% to 2.0% 1.0% to 3.0% TABLE 1: Rental Forecast For Multiple-User Factory And Warehouse & Logistics Segments Source Savills Research & Consultancy to profi teer by building in anticipatory price increases. However, for the next one to two quarters, the impact of infl ation on rents is not one-one because the ability of tenants to pay much higher rents is still weak. It is weak because the delays in meeting production or construction deadlines plus rises in material prices cannot be fully passed through to the customer because many are caught in contracts signed during pre- COVID days which have limited scope to adjust for cost variations. Beyond that, businesses which made it through these tough times, will be those which are stronger and have a better ability to pay higher rents. On the capital markets side, sellers may withdraw from the market as they may fi nd replacement premises coming at a higher price or rent and this would move prices of industrial and warehousing space up. In view of the dynamics surrounding the rental and capital markets, we are forecasting rents in 2022 to rise by 2.0% to 3.0% with capital values rising between 3.0% to 5.0%. Warehousing space would see rental increases clustered around the higher end of the range and buildings with longer land lease terms remaining experiencing greater price appreciation. In summary, because both micro and macro forces are looking down favourably on the industrial and logistics sectors, the downside risk in 2022 is reduced considerably.
