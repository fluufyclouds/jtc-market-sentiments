(Photo: Reuters/Edgar Su)SINGAPORE: Singapore's stock market went into a steep slide on Friday (Mar 13) as fears over the COVID-19 pandemic deepened, joining a global rout that has seen shellshocked investors across the world tip into a \"sell-everything mode\".The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) fell as much as 6.3 per cent to 2,510.88 during intra-day trading, Bloomberg data showed.This is the lowest since Jul 24, 2009, when it touched 2,503.38, according to data from Phillip Securities' online trading platform.The index ended the day at 2,634, down 1.7 per cent, with losers outpacing winners at 430 to 137.\"This is a volatile situation that is likely to last for some time,\" Ms Pan Jingyi, market strategist at IG, told CNA.\"The fact of the matter is that the coronavirus gives a lot of uncertainty and although we have a lot of policy support, we will see a little bit more caution. I would recommend being a little more cautious at this point in time,\" she added.Property and financial counters were among the worst hit, with Mapletree Commercial Trust, City Developments Ltd, CapitaLand and DBS losing as much as 10.2 per cent, 7.6 per cent, 7.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively.\"It is worrisome and diving too fast,\" said Mr Alvin Lee, 41, who holds stocks in Singapore and the US.\"With the current market situation it seems like everyone is selling. But it might be a good chance to buy some if you have spare cash,\" he added.Housewife Mrs Tan SL, 40, agreed: \"Panic selling doesn't do us good. Be rational. Time to buy good blue chip stocks.\"MAS SAYS IT STANDS READY TO ENSURE ORDERLY FUNCTIONINGSingapore's central bank said on Friday that the Singapore dollar money market and foreign exchange market are functioning normally in the face of heightened volatility in global and domestic financial markets.The Monetary Authority of Singapore left a higher level of liquidity in the banking system through its money market operations, and Singapore dollar interest rates have eased in tandem with global interest rates, it said.\"Financial markets globally have come under strain in reaction to the now-widespread COVID-19 outbreak,\" said MAS.\"MAS stands ready to ensure the orderly functioning of financial markets and the stability of the financial system in Singapore,\" it added.Singapore on Friday extended border restrictions to individuals with recent travel history toItaly, France, Spain and Germany.The new restrictions, which take effect at 11.59pm on Sunday,come after an increase in imported cases in Singapore, particularly of those with travel history to European countries, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday.Additionally, with immediate effect, all visitors entering Singapore withfever or symptoms of respiratory illness will also be issued with a 14-day Stay-Home Notice, regardless of their travel history or the results of swab tests at the checkpoint.The health ministry has also put in place additional social distancing measures, saying that all ticketed cultural, sports and entertainment events with 250 participants or more are to be deferred or cancelled.Singapore had 187 confirmed cases of COVID-19as of Thursday, of which96 cases have recovered andbeen discharged from hospital.Globally, about 134,530 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 4,970 have died, according to a Reuters tally.Singapore has said that it expects the COVID-19 outbreak to potentially extend past one year, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warning on Thursday that the country faces a \"serious situation\", with a \"possible spike\" in new cases, more clusters and new waves of infection from other countries.However, the situation remains under control and Singapore will not raise its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition(DORSCON) level toRed, he also said.\"SELL-EVERYTHING MODE\"The slide in Singapore's stock market followed a global rout that saw US stocks plunge nearly 10 per cent overnight in their biggest one-day losses since the 1987 market crash.\"Global markets appear to have been tipped over into a sell-everything mode,\" said Ms Pan in a market update.\"The message that the market is giving to us - with safe haven assets being sold off, a lot of alternative assets - suggest that sentiment is being hit quite badly,\" Ms Pan told CNA separately.She said that she expects some form of stability to reach the markets in under two months.\"In terms of market stablisation ... The wait for civilisation to reach the shores will take six to seven weeks,\" she said.Mr Andrew Slimmon, head of applied equity advisors team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said that while it would be \"naive not to concede a recession is a possibility\", it would be \"highly unlikely\".\"Don't get swayed by the doom and gloomers. I think this health scare will be behind us by the summer, but more pain will come near-term and I would be patient on chasing incremental dollars into the market,\" he said.Download our appor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

We are growing a strong start-up ecosystem and will continue to find new and innovative ways to support local businesses.Those in attendance, which include founders of Carousell, Ninja Van and Love, Bonito, generate multimillion-dollar sales and numerous job opportunities for the Singapore workforce.PM Lees lunch drew attention where entrepreneurs have been given scant attention in Singapore. A comment from cofounder of Pslove Tan Peck Ying sums this up: In our minds, we always think that the prime minister meets only the big companies.But I would argue that as an advanced country with one of the highest GDP per capita in the world, that have exploited advantages in manufacturing, engineering and other high-tech fields that require an educated, high-skilled workforce, the next stage of Singapores ascent up the economic ladder will depend heavily on its ability to continuously innovate and develop indigenous deep tech.2019 was a significant year for the Singapore tech start-up scene. Carousell achieved a valuation of over S$1 billion. Shopee opened its new Singapore headquarters in Science Park, with Razer and Grab announcing plans to do so in 2020.Much of this challenge will rest on the shoulders of high-tech start-up founders, but a report by NUS Enterprise in 2017 on the Growth Dynamics of High-Tech Start-ups in Singapore suggest only one in two start-ups will survive beyond five years.The same report, however, notes that this rate of success is higher compared to the US and UK, advanced economies high on the innovation rung.The challenge seems one of financing and customer acquisition. The same study revealed that 85 per cent of young start-ups relied on self-funding, while 57 per cent tapped on personal contacts to reach its first customers.A VIBRANT TECH START-UP SCENEIf the next stage of Singapores growth shifts from a reliance on multinational corporations towards homegrown start-ups that we hope to scale-up and internationalise, then its worth pouring more resources into boosting support for entrepreneurs.The ferment, the effervescence, the ingenuity and brilliance which has gone into the tech scene has already made a big change in the world, PM Lee said in a dialogue with venture capital firm Sequoia Capital in 2017.Singapore youths recognise this and want a piece of this pie. More are stepping forward to start a business and innovate.The proportion of youths starting their own business that lead to intellectual property ownership and expansion overseas have increased in 2016 compared to 2010.National University of Singapore Overseas College, a hugely successful entrepreneurial education programme, has 3,300 alumni members over 17 years and one in three have gone on to start their business.In tandem, the number of opportunities aspiring entrepreneurs can tap on to maximise their chances of success has grown.On a macro level, policymakers have invested S$19 billion to enhance our capabilities to be a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 administered by the National Research Foundation.Entrepreneurs can access a range of financial support today, from early-stage funding to support for capability development, business transformation and overseas expansion which include a spectrum of instruments from matching funds, grants to offset costs and equity funding.For instance, first-time entrepreneurs can apply for S$30,000 Start-up SG Founder Grants with 45 Accredited Mentor Partners, some of whom offer equity-free advice, networks and learning programmes in administering the grant applications.Indeed, beyond financial support, grants are increasingly providing both monetary and non-monetary support. Youths are also encouraged to nurture their budding entrepreneurship inclinations in more recent years.TECH FOR GOODMore organisations are getting into this space to catalyse the development of tech for public good, recognising the changing role of the private sector, the importance of developing stakeholder capitalism and corporates that address critical societal challenges and include Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).This was the key theme at the World Economic Forum that concluded this month.The SG Youth Action Plan, led by the National Youth Council and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, has rolled out a Youth Action Challenge, which allows aspiring young entrepreneurs to team up to formulate solutions to issues ranging from societal, environmental and the future of work and reshape Singapore. Winning teams can secure up to S$50,000 grant to implement their ideas.Since September 2018, the Tote Board has piloted Shared Gifting a new form of funding that empowers selected grant administrators from non-profit organisations, tech entrepreneurs and social enterprises to oversee the use of S$2 million grant to deliver projects that would improve children and youth mental health.Through the selection process, eight were appointed to manage funds from Tote Board. They collectively decide the projects to fund that meet the grant mandate, and can propose their own projects or collaborate as a collective entity on a single project to maximise returns.Such mechanisms afford budding entrepreneurs with the most innovative ideas the platform to interact with and learn from public and private sector professionals, familiarise themselves with industry-specific challenges and improve their business value-proposition.An entrepreneur in such network benefits from the resource sharing and know-know to reach their customers.One expects more of such programmes to mushroom as more advanced economies move towards tapping on innovation as a bigger driver of growth. Budget 2020 also bears watching for many in this scene.KNOCK-ON BENEFITS FOR ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL EXPANSIONWhat is significant in both programmes, however, is the de-emphasising of track record in favour of promoting innovation, and the knock-on benefits for enterprise development.This skews the focus towards innovative but untested ideas, rather than a bias for established companies and proven ideas many private equity and venture capital funds look to.Such programmes may be riskier but may find a few diamonds in the rough compared to safer grant and accelerator programmes.Finally, the presence of a community of stakeholders motivates and nurtures youth entrepreneurship.This also provides a foundation for local players to understand each others strengths, as a basis for future collaboration when companies mature and seek to grow beyond serving the domestic market.In fact, to enhance competitiveness, local companies seeking to break into foreign markets will do well to team up instead of treating each other as rivals.The resources poured into building the ecosystem to maximise the chances of an entrepreneurs business becoming a homegrown unicorn is not a zero-sum game.These growth-seeking tech start-ups in Singapore have introduced more new products, generate higher revenue on R&D and have a higher propensity to own IP assets, in addition to creating more jobs annually compared to start-ups in other areas.Supporting more of such companies through innovative grant mechanisms can generate returns in the long-term and keep our economy vibrant as we enter the next stage of our economic development.The success of these entrepreneurs will in turn, enhance Singapores start-up ecosystem, as entrepreneurs-turn-investors may form investment networks to fund the next generation of aspiring entrepreneurs.Oon Tian Sern is founder of Acceset, recipient of the Queens Young Leader Award in 2018 and associate with the Philip Yeo Initiative."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(File photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)SINGAPORE: The butterfly effect is the idea that small changes, like a butterfly flapping its wings, can catalyse huge changes that have massive ramifications for complex systems.Since Singapore entered DORSCON Orange in February, work began its long migration into homes, with split team arrangements implemented by firms as a preventive measure to mitigate the spread of the disease.And after the circuit breaker was imposed in April, work-from-home (WFH) became a default mode for work, alongside home-based learning for schools.Many corporate leaders and tech giants like Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Google will allow staff to work remotely until early 2021 when chances of a vaccine being developed and distributed are higher. A handful, like Twitter, have even gone further to extend WFH arrangements to staff indefinitely.WORK IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE OFFICEThose butterfly effects have been felt immediately in Singapores once vibrant Central Business District.Some offices have emptied since the circuit breaker when white-collar workers and executives were mandated to stay home.Despite Education Minister and Multi-ministry taskforce co-chair Lawrence Wong urging companies to let workers return to the office on Sep 24, working remotely from home has become a new normal and will persist in a post COVID-19 world, even if only for a few days a week.This go against decades-long trend of agglomeration, where face-to-face interactions fuelled collaboration, learning and innovation, leading over time to the high concentration of firms in high-rise skyscrapers in city centres around the world and feeding sky-high rents in those districts.Yet, overnight, work decentralised into homes, aided by video-conferencing platforms and communications technologies, like Zoom, Webex and Teamviewer.Another leap was made when the necessity of remote working paved the way for a change in mindsets in employers who experienced first-hand productivity gains.\"I don't fear any slowness as we work to distribute our workforce now, and I do think we have to build a company that's not entirely dependent on San Francisco,\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said.FIRMS MAY MOVE AWAY FROM THE CBDIn Singapore, the idea of a distributed workforce is not new, and somewhat aligned with the Urban Redevelopment Authoritys strategy since its groundbreaking Concept Plan of 1991 to set up regional centres in Jurong East, Woodlands and Tampines to move offices out of the congested city centre and closer to residential estates.There have been successes in getting corporates to shift out prior to COVID-19. Google moved its local headquarters out from Asia Square 1 to the city fringe into Mapletree Business City 2 in 2016.Ifmore firms relook their WFH policy and review the need for big office spaces in the CBD, this decentralisation could cool demand there and even hasten the exodus of firms from the city centre, leaving behind excess building space.While owners of older buildings, such as AXA tower and International Plaza, may be pressured to convert these to mixed-use developments and take advantage of URAs CBD Incentive Scheme, the current economic downturn due to COVID-19 may delay such redevelopment plans.But in the longer term, these trends underway will unleash a new wave of changes in the urban structure of CBD, accelerating its reconfiguration, now a predominantly business and financial district, into a more integrated work-live-play place.Urgent rethinking is needed to realise plans for the 360 ha in the Marina Bays downtown and the 2,000 ha in the future Greater Southern Waterfront into this reality. In fact, the planned 20,000 more homes to be added there as part of the 2019 URA Master Plan may even need to be revised upwards.If so, more schools, social and recreational amenities, and better transport connectivity will be required.As workers have more WFH days, they may be less willing to pay for expensive housing space in the core central region (CCR).And if workspaces are distributed more permanently to the outside central region (OCR), price differentials for private houses in OCR and CCR may come down.CHANGES IN THE HOMEThe modern Singapore home is not really suited for WFH where homes have been designed for rest, retreat and dining, with little remaining space for work.According to the Department of Statistics, the average household size for HDB 4-room flat is 3.22 with a typical floor area of 90 sqm - meaning around 28 sqm per person.This number is lower for families who live in compact shoebox units with a typical floor area of around 50 sqm.Many have repurposed the dining table for work but even that can be challenging with video calls and home-based learning happening simultaneously.Separate study areas where each family member can focus on work or school is ideal, beyond bedrooms providing this makeshift segregation. Some households may prefer an additional purpose-built study room.In retrospect, the 2018 URA guidelines requiring a minimum average unit size of 85 sqm for new developments in OCR and 100 sqm in selected areas, which may have been intended to reduce infrastructure strain in neighbourhoods, now look prescient where they mandate developers to provide larger spaces for residents.Residential buildings are less well insulated acoustically to cut off noise. Traffic noise, noisy neighbours, and people movements can pose unhelpful distractions when working from home.But simple improvements, like ensuring stable and reliable high-speed broadband networks, installing day curtains and setting up a home office space with a comfortable, table, chair and monitor, can vastly improve productivity.We will also likely see more Singaporeans invest in making their homes work-friendly.US online remodelling platform Houzz reported a 50 per cent surge in leads for home renovations after lockdowns were imposed. People channelled funds usually saved for holidays to remodel home offices, kitchens and undertake other improvement works to make homes more liveable. MORE MICROBUSINESSES As more Singaporeans experience income uncertainty and job losses, we may also see more set up their own microenterprises.While microbusinesses have been allowed to run from homes under the Home Office Scheme (HOS) since 2001, in recognition that home-based entrepreneurship scheme promote the creation of business and entrepreneurship, these have been limited mostly to certain professional services such as consultancy, insurance and financial planning services.HOS had led to the creation of new businesses by 23 per cent, a 2019 study Professor Sumit Agarwal and two other colleagues found. More may take up the scheme, as an alternative to co-working space providers.After all, WeWork and JustCo typically charges S$200 to S$500 for a hot desk. Saving on rent can reduce business costs and help a good number of firms survive. Our past research shows firms set up after 2001 that were able to utilise HOS are 29 per cent less likely to exit compared to firms set up before 2001.CHANGES IN NEIGHBOURHOODSAs Singapore residents spend more time at home, neighbourhood shops will see a bigger boost in demand.While WFH has adversely impacted restaurants, food joints, cafs and pubs in the CBD, where businesses are dependent on office workers, coffee shops, eating houses and supermarkets in residential estates saw an uptick in business.Food delivery services, such as Panda, Deliveroo, Grab, offering island-wide delivery and providing key lifelines to downtown eateries, have seen a surge in demand.But our bet is that big brand names, cafes and new-fangled dining concepts may find residential estates more attractive locations for a second outlet.Despite conventional wisdom that COVID-19 has decimated F&B, nearly 201 new F&B entities have been formed in the three months (June to August) after the reopening of the economy based on Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority data.There was also a net increase of 96 F&B entities in the first half of 2020 alone, which include restaurants, cafes, food caterers, food kiosks and bars, according to data analysis firm Handshakes.More cloud kitchens have popped up near residential estates during COVID-19. Jollibee recently opens its first shared kitchen dedicated to delivery orders at Tampines Smart City.Some big brand names in retail are also moving into neighbourhood malls. Don Don Donki opened their largest outlet at JEM earlier this year and IKEA is opening a 3-storey outlet in the same mall next year.As Singapore readies to shift into Phase 3 of our reopening, we may have to adjust and adapt to a new normal that brings live, work and play closer to home.Current land use patterns may undergo significant structural shifts if WFH becomes a default modus operandi for most firms and office workers.It sounds like a very small change but this butterfly may stir up a storm.The CNA Leadership Summit 2020: Navigating the Post-Pandemic World will discuss through a series of TV programmes and webinars how businesses and organisationshave reacted to the pandemicand applied innovative practices.More details are available at:cna.asia/leadership-summit.Kwok Tian Long isResearch Associate at the Department of Real Estate (DRE) and Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS), and Professor Sing Tien Foo is the Head of DRE and Director of IREUS at the National University of Singapore.The views and opinions expressed herein are those of the authors and do not represent the views and opinions of the National University of Singapore or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: Eileen Poh)SINGAPORE: Property news headlines these days have left many scratching their heads.Sales have been hitting multi-year highs in one month, but plunging the next all this amid the deepest recession in Singapore due to the ongoing pandemic.Last October, new private home sales fell by 51.7 per cent to 642 units, down from Septembers two-year high of 1,329 units, leading some to wonder if pent-up demand has started to fizzle out.Others questioned if this was a result of new restrictions on the re-issuance of Options to Purchase (OTPs) implemented at the end of September.But monthly sales figures do not fully reflect the state of the overall market and buying behaviour of consumers.Potential buyers and sellers evaluating the private residential market should focus on market fundamentals, including demand and supply dynamics, price trends, and historical data and adopt a holistic approach and take a long-term view when investing in property.DEMAND FIZZLING OUT?Property news that make headlines are sure to garner attention. The October decline in private home sales was little different.While the new OTP rule may have had some impact, the main reason for Octobers sales drop was more likely the simple lack of launches during the month. There was only one new project in October Hyll on Holland, which sold five units.In contrast, Septembers sales were boosted by launches such as Penrose, Verdale and Myra which contributed to nearly 34 per cent (or 448 units) of the monthly sales. Without these new launches, Septembers sales would not be that much higher than October.Developers monthly sales crossed 1,000 units from July to September before falling in October. Looking at the final two months of 2020, new home sales are not likely to breach the 1,000-unit mark, given limited mega launches ahead.It is also worth noting that average monthly new home sales have not exceeded 1,000 units since the introduction of new cooling measures in June 2013.But underlying demand for private homes has been strong throughout the pandemic, driven by local buyers and HDB upgraders.Home sales rebounded in the second quarter of 2020, after the end of the circuit breaker imposed from Apr 7 to Jun 1. Of note, about 80 per cent of new private homes sold in the first nine months of 2020 were bought by Singaporeans representing the highest proportion since 2010, according to Realis data.During the circuit breaker, consumers became more comfortable with digital property marketing and virtual viewings. They also probably had more time to evaluate their real estate portfolio and investment plans.Knowing that the market has turned in favour of buyers coupled with the low interest rate environment and ample liquidity in the market many consumers with ready funds made their property purchases between July and September.PROPERTY MARKET ON FIRMER FOOTINGThat the property market remains resilient despite COVID-19 and Singapores worst recession on record did not happen by chance.The series of cooling measures rolled out in previous years placed the property market on firmer footing, heading into this crisis. They led to limited speculative activity, households purchasing homes prudently and home prices moving more in line with economic and income growth.The property market today is stable and should see sustainable growth. This was not the case in past crises where the property market seemed to go through a boom-bust cycle.When the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, Singapore recorded a full-year GDP contraction of 1.1 per cent and the private property price index plunged 11.7 per cent that year.In 2003, when SARS hit Singapore, private home prices posted a 2.1 per cent decline for the full year, before recovering in 2004.What followed was 17 quarters of growth where prices increased by 58 per cent from Q2 2004 to Q2 2008.The price growth ground to a halt following the global financial crisis, which saw home values fall by 23 per cent from Q3 2008 to Q2 2009.Then came another wave of price increase over 17 quarters from the second half of 2009 to Q3 2013 where values jumped by 40 per cent. This was also the period where a flurry of cooling measures was introduced.After the June 2013 measures were in place, property prices began to move in a more orderly manner. Following a couple of quarters of sharper price rise in 2018, fresh cooling measures were introduced in July 2018.STABLE PRICES AND A RESILIENT MARKETAll in all, the Government which has said it will continue to watch the market closely has successfully engineered a soft landing in the property market, ensuring that prices do not run away from economic fundamentals.The huge stimulus almost S$100 billion that the Government has committed as part of its COVID-19 response has also helped to save jobs and support the housing market.This war chest is substantially bigger than the S$230 million SARS Relief Package announced in April 2003, and the S$20.5 billion Resilience Package put forth in January 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis.For home owners and investors, the various cooling measures total debt servicing ratio, additional buyers stamp duty, sellers stamp duty, lowered loan-to-value ratio will help them make more prudent property buying decisions.Being less leveraged on property purchase, households should have better holding power when the going gets tough, mitigating distressed sales.These curbs have also helped to eliminate speculation in properties, leading to more stable prices and a more resilient market. CONSIDERATIONS WHEN BUYING PROPERTYDespite uncertainties ahead caused by the pandemic, the outlook for the property market remains positive over the mid- to long-term, because Singapores fundamentals safety, political stability, a competitive and pro-business environment are still intact. In evaluating property investment, buyers should focus instead on two main areas: Affordability, and thorough financial planning to ensure they can hold on to the property for at least 5 years.Ideally, buyers should have a financial safety net of 12 months worth of mortgage payment set aside (either in cash or in the CPF) to tide them through any unforeseen events, such as job loss.Even if a buyer is purchasing a home for his or her own stay, it is still important to consider the propertys capital appreciation potential, in ensuring ones retirement adequacy in the future.A property purchase is a significant financial commitment. Buyers should be clear-headed about their financial ability, housing needs and investment objectives, and be less caught up with emotions roused by news headlines or the fear of missing out.Ismail Gafoor is CEO of PropNex.Listen to Ismail Gafoor discuss developments in the property market since COVID-19 hit on the Heart of the Matter podcast:"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: ET&Co)SINGAPORE: The conservation status plans for Golden Mile Complex (GMC) has been extremely well received by the conservation circle.This is a landmark decision for heritage conservation in Singapore as it opens a new page in our efforts to preserve significant architectural heritage.Particularly, since GMC is a strata-titled property, the gazetting of this substantial private property for conservation while given enough development incentives is indeed trailblazing locally and even regionally.As the first project of its kind, we might want to consider the framework in which this decision was made and how the community can embrace the framework objectively.Conservation is value-based, it is about passing on heritage of significance to future generations. The buildings that are preserved are identity markers of societys achievements that community in the future can be proud of or debate over.Architecture conservation is primarily a sociocultural endeavour. Historic buildings are conserved for their intrinsic role in the development of the society and community, and not just for the technical or aesthetic value of the architecture.However, much has to be done to convince the current generation that a rigorous assessment process had been carried out in conservation decisions to ascertain the value of heritage for the community to buy in.This is fundamental in the conservation process. There are three pillars in value-based conservation assessment recognised internationally: Historical, social and architectural value.In the case of GMC, a great deal of research and advocacy went on behind the scenes: The Singapore Heritage Society, International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) Singapore and International Committee on Documentation and Conservation of Buildings (DoCoMoMo) Singapore had been at the forefront in advocating the conservation of modernist buildings in Singapore.Likewise, architectural students in NUS and elsewhere had been exploring the conserved and reused future of GMC. HOW THE GOLDEN MILE COMPLEX WAS DESIGNEDTo begin with, all buildings and urban planning are products of the historical and cultural development of a society. Urban and architecture designs reflect the context of the society and contribute to the national history in her development.In the early 1960s, Singapore went through a difficult time with much political turmoil. However, with independence in 1965, the new nation looked towards an exciting future with a new identity.It is in this context that the Government sought a new planning, urban design and architectural vision to usher in the new era of self-confidence and nationhood.The result was the plan to develop the eastern section of Beach Road into the new commercial, office and residence hub of the country, hence the name Golden Mile.Bold planning and architectural initiatives were soon put forward to create the modern infrastructure, such as streets in the sky and separate vehicular and pedestrian traffic along the key road.And GMC was the first multi-purpose complex built as a symbol of progress in the efforts to propel Singapore into a global city, as pointed out by architecture scholar Koon H Wee.GMC has a historical position in putting into built form the national agenda at the founding stage. Other examples of successful conservations are the former Singapore Conference Hall, Peoples Park Complex and the former Subordinate Courts.But there are also others that slipped through the net the former National Theatre and the Pearl Bank Apartments are two that come to mind.HOW DO WE DEFINE SHARED VALUES?Within the context of the historical development, we should also examine the architectural heritage in how it has been regarded by the society during its lifetime, including current attitudes.Issues such as identity, shared memory and asense of belonging, should be examined.Social value of built heritage has been accorded increasingly important consideration for architectural conservation in recent years.It is an embodied value that can only be extricated by qualitative studies, including focus group interviews and participatory engagements.I would argue that social value is a crucial yardstick for determining the significance of heritage buildings for conservation.Because of the position of GMC on Beach Road, initially amongrows of shophouses, and later adjacent to HDB estates, and due to its mixed-use design, the building has always been the centre of the community in the neighbourhood.In recent years when GMC became a Thai community hub, it has takenon another social meaning in Singapore. Society is evolving, there are constant changes and in Singapore, sometimes at break-neck speed.Conservation is essentially management of change. To preserve the social meaning of GMC and other heritage should be a key objective of architectural conservation.THE BEAUTY OF BRUTALIST ARCHITECTUREArchitecturally, GMC represents an important example of the international Brutalist style, a movement that flourished between the 1950s and 1970s.Brutalist buildings, which display structural honesty with exposed raw concrete material, were embraced by many great architects of the 20th century, such as Le Corbusier and Paul Rudolph.The style is seen as a tour-de-force of the rebirth of societies after the ravages of the Second World War. Because of its quiet monumentality, the style was also chosen for the institutional architecture in some countries after they gained independence from colonial powers.The elements and architectural language used in this style is also part of the Modernist movement in architecture which connotes modernity and internationalism.Being part of a small group of Brutalist buildings in Southeast Asia, such as the Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh (Vann Molyvann 1964), Tanghalang Pambansa in Manila (National Theatre, Leandro Valencia Locsin, 1969) and the Australian High Commission Building in Kuala Lumpur (Joyce Nankivell Associates, 1979), the conservation of GMC will lead efforts in the conservation of these post-war structures.GMC has a well-articulated form, excellent spatial experience, and relates well to its waterfront location.As one of the first mixed use development with shopping, office and housing in one mega-block, GMC is also a pioneer in the architectural experimentation with the podium-and-block typology that is now common place in large-scale development in Asian cities.The architects William Lim, Tay Kheng Soon and Gan Eng Oon of Design Partnership (now known as DP Architects), showed architectural mastery in giving GMC a clarity of forms through the distinctive separation of three functionalities: Alarge block of shops around a top-lit atrium, an office block with faade emphasizing horizontality and a novel stepped-housing block.This is an important contribution to architectural form of mixed-use development, both in Singapore and the region.WHAT NEXT FOR SINGAPORE ARCHITECTUREGMC has a significant place in Singapore history. The progressive vision of a new country was translated into physical form by three pioneer architects.Educated in both renowned architectural schools in London and Boston, as well as in the local architectural school, Lim, Tay and Gan played a crucial role in the discourse on urbanism, architecture and culture of the new nation, as well as in serving as a think tank on planning and the built environment consulted by the Government.The two major landmark projects of the architects, Peoples Park Complex (1973) and GMC, embody the aspiration of the architecture practice of producing an architecture that uplifts the human spirit.The impact of their vision and architecture can still be seen in the projects of the practice. This is essentially the historical value of GMC.Because of its simplicity of form and elements, modernist architecture tend to be least accepted by the public. Many of them might be functional in design and considered too utilitarian and commonplace in appearance.However, post-war buildings are usually institutional and communal in use, such as schools, hospitals, public housing and commercial buildings.They are cornerstones of everyday life that built modern Singapore, and should be considered significant elements in our history.Many young architects in Singapore are very keen to conserve modernist heritage, paying great respect to their architectural values, and are capable of turning GMC and other structures for contemporary use.The potential of conservation and adaptive reuse of modernist architecture is enormous, thus the current conditions of the buildings should not be a hindrance to their conservation.The way forward for architecture conservation in Singapore should be a holistic and honest evaluation of our modern heritage thatarticulates their architectural, historical and social values in light of the formative years of nation building.This is an issue facing many cities in rapidly developing Asia, but receivesvery little attention due to the antiquated view of what constitutes heritage. We should regard GMC as the first of many modernist buildings in Singapore for conservation due to the vigorous social, architectural and historical value assessment.Singapore can and should lead the region in the conservation of modernist architecture.Ho Puay Peng is Head, Department of Architecture, NUS School of Design and Environment and the UNESCO Chair Professor in Architectural Heritage Conservation and Management in Asia."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: Shopee)SINGAPORE: When we think of unicorn start-ups in the region, many people will immediately think of Grab, valued at around US$14 billion (S$19.05 billion) based on its latest round of financing.But there is another successful start-up in Singapore that leaves Grab in its wake in some aspects.Sea Limited is probably Singapores largest company. Yet many Singaporeans may never even have heard of it unless they happen to be an avid gamer or online shopper.But even then, the name might not be quite as familiar as Grab whose logo is emblazoned across its livery of private-hire cars, food-delivery riders and payment services through its mobile app.The understated Sea Limited was founded by Forrest Li in Singapore in 2009 originally as Garena, which is an online games portal. Instead of listing on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in its hometown of Singapore, the company chose to be floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 2017.That strategy has worked well for Sea Limited. The companys stock has soared more than 1,000 per cent since the beginning of 2018 and nearly 300 per cent this year alone, giving it a current market value of S$92.7 billion and making it the company that has gained the most market value this year on the Nasdaq.In terms of market value, Sea Limiteds lofty price tag makes it nearly twice as big as Singapores largest listed company, DBS Group; three times larger than Singtel, and almost eight times bigger than Singapores largest real estate investment trust, Ascendas REIT.A STASH OF CASHThe staggering valuation of Sea Limited is even more amazing, given that it has not made a cent in profit either at the operating level or on the bottom line for the last six years. But as they say in the stock market, it is better to travel than to arrive, especially if you can afford to pay for the ride.And Sea Limited has plenty of cash in the tank. Not only does its balance sheet boasts S$4.75 billion of cash in the bank, it also has a visionary investor, Tencent Holdings, which has very deep pockets. The Chinese internet conglomerate owns 22.9 per cent of Sea Limiteds outstanding shares.Tencents interest in Sea Limited probably stems from the Singapore companys success in tapping into the growing video gaming market in Southeast Asia.For some perspective, the size of the global video-gaming market is estimated to be worth US$174 billion by 2021. The Asia-Pacific region is especially significant, with revenue of US$72 billion in 2019, which is more than double of the North American market.EMERGING GROWTHThe key markets in Asia Pacific for Sea Limited are China, Japan, and South Korea. But beyond those top three countries, there are opportunities aplenty in Southeast Asias emerging growth market, which is where Sea Limited plans to dominate, through its Garena games platform.In 2019, revenue from its Digital Entertainment division of S$1.5 billion was more than double that of S$630 million a year ago. It accounted for almost half of the groups total revenue of S$2.9 billion. Whats more, it has been growing quickly. It is three times more than at the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2017.The secret of Garenas growth has been through its popular video game Free Fire, which was developed by 111 Dots Studio and published by Garena.The success of Free Fire has been attributed to its ability to run on almost every device, especially on low-end handsets that tend to be more prevalent in some of the less developed regions of Southeast Asia. These include Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand where Sea Limited operates.The rising demand for Free Fire has propelled it to become the most downloaded video game in 2019. In 2020, Garena said the video game hit a peak record of 80 million daily active users, which surpassed its previous record of 60 million daily active users.FLAMES OF SUCCESSEven though Free Fire has been a massive success for Sea Limited, gamers are typically on the lookout for the next best thing and might consequently choose to move on.This is where Sea Limiteds strategic partnership with Tencent could be a win-win for both companies.A good example is the collaboration between Chinas Tencent, Singapores Sea Limited and Americas Activision Blizzard to offer the Call of Duty: Mobile game in Southeast Asia. It has allowed Garena to expand beyond its own developed games.There is another reason why the collaboration could be mutually beneficial. In 2018 Chinas regulators took active steps to crack down on gaming addiction amongst minors. The State Administration of Press and Publication (SAPP) applied stricter regulation to limit the number of games entering the market each year.There are signs that some of the restrictions have been eased by the SAPP since the start of this year. But a collaboration between the two companies could provide a convenient alternative route to market for Tencents video games, which could also be beneficial for Sea Limited.Collaboration is key it makes little sense for Tencent to reinvent the wheel when there are established platforms and alliances that it can tap into overseas.The company said that Tencent Games aims to have as many users overseas as it has in China. For instance, Tencent is examining an expansion of its partnership with Nintendo to build console games for American gamers.Meanwhile, Sea Limited could be its door to growth in Southeast Asia. BEYOND THE SEABeyond gaming, Sea Limited is also active in e-commerce through its Shopee platform, which has grown faster than Digital Entertainment. In 2017, e-commerce registered revenue of S$24.08 million. By 2019, it had ballooned nearly 50-fold to S$1.12 billion. That said, e-commerce is still unprofitable for Sea Limited.It recorded an operating loss of S$1.52 billion on those sales in 2019. It is unclear when Shopee would be profitable, given greater competition in this area, most of which, like its biggest rival Lazada, are backed by Chinese Internet titan, Alibaba.But clearly COVID-19 has benefitted e-commerce companies as millions of people have been forced to stay at home.In June 2020, Sea Limited said gross orders accelerated 150 per cent year-on-year, whilst adjusted revenue was up 187 per cent over the same period.It also said that in Indonesia, where Shopee is the largest e-commerce platform, a daily average of more than 2.8 million orders was 130 per cent higher than last year.It added that Shopee continued to rank number one in the Shopping category by active monthly users in Southeast Asia and in Taiwan.A VIRTUOUS CIRCLEBeing number one is important. Apart from attracting more customers to the site, it also draws in more vendors to sell their merchandise on the platform, which in turn attracts more customers.The network can be a virtuous circle that could allow Shopee to invest in more efficient ways to fulfil customer orders by plane, boat, and road.The key is to operate at lower cost than the competition, which can be achieved through investments in efficient fulfilment.There is a third string to Sea Limiteds bow, which is Digital Financial Services through its SeaMoney digital payment and digital wallet. This is by far Sea Limiteds smallest divisions which accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of total revenue.But it is early days, yet. The service was only introduced in the fourth quarter of 2019 with the idea that it could provide payment processing and e-wallet services by integrating it with Shopee.There are indications that it is working. In the second quarter of 2020, more than 45 per cent of Shopees gross orders in Indonesia were paid using the mobile wallet.Sea Limited has aspirations for SeaMoney beyond an integration with its e-commerce platform. It recently applied for a digital banking licence in Singapore and it is one of the top contenders. A licence would allow it to take deposits and provide banking services to both retail and non-retail customers.With gaming, e-commerce, and now digital payments in its suite of offerings, the future of Sea Limited is in its own hands. Its destiny will be determined by how quickly it can transform a business, which has turned cash flow positive, into one that is profitable at the bottom line.From an investors perspective, the financial numbers in an improving profit-loss account, a healthy balance sheet and a strong cash flow statement speak volumes.Sea Limited can make the right kind of waves by delivering the things that shareholders want rising earnings. And if it can continue to see progress on that front, Sea Limited could remain Singapores most valuable company even in the future.David Kuo is the co-founder of The Smart Investor and previously the CEO of the Motley Fool Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

More than three decades and many anti-smoking measures later, the goal remains to convince fewer people to light up.File photo of an elderly man smoking in public (Photo: Jeremy Long)SINGAPORE: About a year ago, Mr Muhammad Adli Jumat, 27, tried quitting smoking for the third time.His previous attempts had involved switching tobacco flavours, then gradually cutting down on the number of cigarettes he smoked each day. The initial weeks progressed well, but after a few months, he lost motivation and relapsed.This time, the marketing executive decided to go cold turkey. He also kept himself more occupied by working harder and going to the gym, with the goal of getting fit for the holidays.But about three to four months in, he started smoking again as his go-to for dealing with stress.\"There were stupid people at work, and I have no willpower to entertain all of those,\" he told CNA. \"People can be super motivated like every new year, but three months in it's gone.\"Mr Adli, who smokes five to six sticks a day, said it would help if authorities gave more incentives to quit, like grocery vouchers or health insurance premium discounts.\"Outreach programs to adult smokers are a lost cause,\" he said. \"By the time these people reach their 20s, it's too late for any real behavioural change.\"Nevertheless, Singapore's anti-smoking measures have seen some success.From as early as the 1970s, the Government hasintroduced measures to promote a smoke-free lifestyle in Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) told CNA.\"In the early days of Singapores independence, smoking was allowed indoors but it was not long before the Smoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act was introduced in October 1970 to prohibit smoking in omnibuses, cinemas and theatres,\" a spokesperson said.The country's smoking rate has shrunk from 18.3 per cent in 1992 to 10.6 per cent in 2019, through a combination of legislative and public education efforts.Authorities haveregulated tobacco advertising and conducted multiple anti-smoking campaigns, mindful of its allure with the young.They have also raised the minimum legal age, made tobacco products more expensive with higher taxes, and prohibited smoking in even more places.\"The inaugural ban in 1970 has since been progressively extended to many other public places,\" NEA said, noting that smoking is now prohibited in more than 32,000 places, including sheltered walkways and common residential areas.\"NEA has been gradually expanding the list of smoking prohibited places covered under the Act in consultation with the public and relevant stakeholders.\"Still, theGovernment wants to reduce the smoking rate even further, to below 10 per cent of the population by this year.Then-Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Amrin Amin called this goal \"ambitious\", after announcing it in 2018. According to the Health Promotion Board (HPB), Singapore's smoking rate is already one of the lowest in the world.To further bring down the rate, a range of options could be considered, according to experts and stakeholders thatCNA spoke to.For instance, a public health expert said the Government could consider offering better protection from secondhand smoke, further increasing the tobacco tax and regulating tobacco flavours.And Member of Parliament (MP) Louis Ng, who heads the Government Parliamentary Committee for Sustainability and the Environment, said authorities could also give more subsidies for quitting programmes, and roll out campaigns that focus on the benefits of quitting rather than the harms of smoking.CURBING SECONDHAND SMOKEThe issue was thrust further into the spotlight when Mr Ng, who is MP for Nee Soon GRC, raised a motion in Parliament on Oct 5, calling for a ban on smoking near windows or balconies at home to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke.It was a controversial suggestion that generated debate, with comments on social media showing non-smokers generally supported such a move.\"The debate is important so that both sides can share their views and their voices are heard,\" Mr Ng told CNA, calling the reaction to his suggestions \"positive\".\"We are tackling hard to bring down the smoking rate because we know its bad,\" he added. \"On the other end of the spectrum, we really need to protect those who are not smoking but could then suffer the same harmful effects. And its a lot of people.\"A public health expert from the National University of Singapore (NUS) told CNA that roughly 300 people in Singapore die from secondhand smoke exposure each year.Dr Yvette van der Eijkof the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Healthsaid tackling secondhand smoke in outdoor areas like hawker centres and residential estates is one way of further reducing the smoking rate.Although Singapore has comprehensive smoking bans covering most indoor areas, people are not protected from secondhand smoke in many outdoor areas,\" she said.\"In some other countries, smoking is regulated in outdoor areas and housing units where people are often crowded together.\"This is an issue that needs to be addressed in Singapore, especially given the high population density and high volume of complaints related to secondhand smoke.\"NEA said theSmoking (Prohibition in Certain Places) Act is one strategy used to protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke.\"In identifying the places where smoking should be prohibited, NEA adopts a pragmatic approach and takes into consideration whether the public places are air-conditioned or enclosed, or are places frequented by families and vulnerable groups,\" the spokesperson said.\"For example, NEA has stopped accepting applications for new smoking corners at food establishments islandwide since Jun 30,2017.\"SELFISH NEIGHBOURHomemaker Ms Carole Ogawa, who lives on the seventh floor of an HDB block in Queenstown, said she closes the seven windows in her living room every day to stop cigarette smoke from wafting in.The 31-year-old said her neighbour downstairs would smoke near the window once in the early morning and once more in the evening, every weekday. The frequency goes up during the weekends.Sometimes we have to shut the window during mealtimes when we are right by it, and the house becomes stuffy, she said. Sometimes when I open my toilet door, it smells like someone was squatting inside smoking.Ms Ogawa said she has visited her neighbour to request that he only smokes at the kitchen window at a fixed time each day, so she has fewer windows to close and knows when to do it.The minute his door opened, it was just a strong smoke smell, she said of the visit, adding that the neighbour was indifferent to what she said. We tried to negotiate, but he didnt keep to it.Ms Ogawa, who has three children aged four, two and one-and-a-half, said this episode has left her super frustrated.Its not just the smell, but the worry that it may cause health problems to my very young children, she said, adding that she has tried getting help from her MP to no avail.COVID made everything worse, the children had no school and had to be kept indoors, and my guess is the neighbour had to work from home because his frequency of smoking increased.The most we can do to protect ourselves is shut the windows, but it makes us resent the neighbour for being so selfish.TO BAN OR NOT TO BANMr Ng had suggested that NEA enforce the partial ban in homes using surveillance cameras, similar to how it detects high-rise littering.But Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor had warned that such methods could be highly intrusive, although Mr Ng noted that the cameras could be calibrated to maintain privacy.The smoker Mr Adli said he was against such a ban, pointing out that it represented yet another stick in a heavily skewed carrot and stick approach.It would blur the line even more on privacy, he said. It might just end up making people point fingers at each other.Another smoker, Mr Mohamed Khaidzir, said he understood the need for such legislation. However, the aircraft lead technician said it might open a can of worms, noting that the burning of incense could be considered in the same category.Everyone has their fair share of air pollutants, said the 29-year-old, who smokes an average of six sticks a day but never at home.However, a fellow smoker who only wanted to be known as Tom said the ban would be good.I feel like you can do whatever you want at home, but when you affect other people, its a no go, said the 28-year-old content writer, who smokes three sticks each day.NEA said it hasadopted a balanced and pragmatic approach, by working with relevant agencies and stakeholders to encourage smokers to be considerate to their neighbours and smoke away from the windows.It is also aware that some local grassroots members are trying out different methods to address secondhand smoke in their areas.For examplein Nee Soon South, members have set up designated smoking points and put up advisoriesat smoking hotspots to remind smokers to be considerate, given the effects of secondhand smoke onvulnerable groups.But NUS Dr van der Eijk saidencouraging smokers to be considerate is unlikely to be enough, noting that people have a right to breathe smoke-free air, especially in their own homes.Back in the 1990s, when countries considered full smoking bans in public places, the tobacco lobby fought hard and invented the concept of 'mutual accommodation' the idea that, instead of regulation, non-smokers and smokers should just try to cooperate on the matter, she added.This did not work and a lot of people were still exposed to secondhand smoke. It was not until the smoking bans were implemented and properly enforced that people were finally protected from secondhand smoke.NEA acknowledged there have been calls from the community to ban smoking at windows or balconies in homes.\"While there have been suggestions for enforcement against smoking acts at home, there are technological and privacy limitations to gathering evidence required to prove such smoking acts,\" the spokesperson reiterated.\"The current technology does not allow us to enforce against smoking acts at home without expanding inordinate expenses and infringing privacy of ordinary people in their homes.\"Implementing stronger, more draconian measures could come across as being overly intrusive, as the home is ultimately a private space.\"Rather than an outright ban, NEA said it works together with agencies like the Housing and Development Board, HPBandrelevant Town Councilsto reach out to smokers in homes.Officers hand out advisories to remind smokersto be considerate to their neighbours, as well as helplines to help them quit smoking, the spokespersonsaid.\"To complement these existing efforts, we are also continuing to improve the process for resolving community disputes, as well as to step up public education efforts,\" the spokesperson added.RAISING TOBACCO TAXESBeyond that, Dr van der Eijk said Singapore could further reduce its smoking rate by adopting a \"more comprehensive stance\" on tobacco taxes, which she said are currently low compared to other developed countries.For instance in Australia, a pack of cigarettes could cost more than S$30, compared to less than S$20 in Singapore.Studies have shown that increasing tobacco taxes and the price of tobacco products is the single most consistently effective tool for reducing tobacco use.In 2018, the Singapore Government raised the excise duty for all tobacco products by 10 per cent to discourage consumption. This followed another 10 per cent increase four years earlier.One smoker, who only gave his name as James, said he would consider quitting more seriously if the price of a cigarette pack hits S$20.That would deter me from indulging in it so frequently, said the 28-year-old airline analyst, who smokes three to five sticks a day.Mr Khaidzir said even the slightest of price hikes would make him reconsider his habit. The old-timers will find the cheapest sources, down to the cent, he added.CARROT APPROACHWhile the MP Mr Ng is a proponent of the partial smoking ban in homes, he acknowledged that authorities could try a more incentive-based approach to reducing the smoking rate.\"We have been using the stick approach, how about we try the carrot?\" Mr Ng said, suggesting setting aside more funding to subsidise cessation programmes.\"When I speak to many smokers, they try to quit, but they just cant. After a while, they pick up the habit again. If we can help people to quit using amore carrot approach, I think that might have a longer-term result.\"Thisseems to be an approach which is being looked at. In March, the Government announced that eligible smokers enrolled in new smoking cessation pilot programmes could get full subsidies for nicotine replacement therapy to help them quit.These would take place in public healthcare institutions like hospitals, polyclinics and national specialty centres after they resume normal operations pending the COVID-19 situation.Mr Ng also suggested \"more positive\" campaigns that highlight the benefits of quitting smoking, possibly told through real-life stories.The HPB'srecent campaign, a video series launched in 2018 titled I Should Have Said, featured ex-smokers sharing regrets about their habit. One of them, after getting throat surgery, struggles to speak to his family during a visit in hospital.\"Being a smoker for 17 years, we are all aware of the harmful effects. So, (health warnings on cigarette packaging) don't work because we already know it,\" Mr Ng said.\"Thats why we should try the carrot approach for those who are really trying to quit, so we can help more. And that might then bring the smoking rate down to below 10 per cent.\"YOUTH SMOKINGMs Ogawa, the resident affected by secondhand smoke, said anti-smoking campaigns should also encourage families to find hobbies and spend quality time together, especially as many parents work long hours.Because of that, parents have less time to spend with their kids, or less me time to unwind, she said, concerned that she still seesstudents in uniform smoking on the rooftop of an adjacent car park.Often, teenagers are left on their own and find bad company. I feel that smoking is a very social thing that many people find to connect.According to the Ministry of Health, smoking prevalence among students in secondary schools, the Institute of Technical Education and polytechnics decreased from 8 per cent in the period from 2011 to 2013, to 4 per cent in the period from 2014 to 2016.In 2017, the average age of those who started smoking daily was 18 years.The smoking minimum legal age will be raised to 21 years from the start of next year. Authorities have also banned the point-of-sale display of tobacco products, which must now come in standardised packaging.To further deter youth smoking, NUS Dr van der Eijk said authorities should consider regulating tobacco flavours, especially menthol.Over half of the cigarettes sold in Singapore are flavoured with menthol, she said, making Singapore's menthol cigarette market share one of the largest in the world.\"Tobacco companies use menthol-flavoured cigarettes to target youth, and the menthol makes cigarettes more addictive,\" she added.\"Although Canada, the European Union and other countries have banned tobacco flavours, there is currently no regulation on tobacco flavours in Singapore.\"ROADBLOCKS AHEADStill, Dr van der Eijk said there are challenges to implementing smoke-free legislation, mainly resistance from the tobacco lobby.They often work through third parties like hospitality associations, retailers and advocacy groups, and typically spread a lot of misinformation to build resistance to smoking bans, she said.For instance, the US-ASEAN Business Council had strongly lobbied against plain tobacco packaging in Singapore, arguing that it would violate Singapores obligations to protect intellectual property rights and serve as unnecessary obstacles to trade.Tobacco giant Philip Morris International, whose Singapore arm made up almost half of the countrys tobacco market share in 2017, actively participates in the US-ASEAN Business Council.Philip Morris had also opposed the tobacco retail display ban on grounds that it imposes unnecessary impediments to the operation of the legitimate tobacco market.These examples were included ina 2018 research paper on tobacco control in Singapore, which was published in the journal Asia & the Pacific Policy Studies. It was co-authored by Ms Gianna Gayle Amul, who was a research associate at NUS Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.Furthermore, Singapores global role as a tobacco distribution hub presents a key challenge for tobacco control, the paper said.According to data from market research firm Euromonitor, Singapore's cigarette exports have increased from 21 billion sticks in 2002 to 27 billion sticks in 2016.Despite having some of the toughest tobacco control measures in place, the operations of transnational tobacco companies based in Singapore create economic, mainly trade, complexities for tobacco control not only in Singapore but also for the region, the paper said.In response to queries from CNA, Philip Morris Singapore saidthat it supported\"evidence-based, pragmatic policies\" that prevent people from picking up smoking and encourage current smokersto quit.\"Phasing out flavoured cigarettesis possible only when smokers have a less harmful alternative to switch to,\" said Mr Jeremy Rabani, head of external affairs at Philip Morris Singapore.While Mr Rabani suggested e-cigarettes as an alternative, Singapore has banned the purchase, use and possession of these devices since 2017. Officials have said theycontain nicotine and cancer-causing chemicals, and produce vapour that could cause respiratory diseases.TOBACCO ENDGAMEDespite the challenges, the tobacco control researchpaper said Singapore can bank on strong policies and strict enforcement to consider moving towards a tobacco endgame, including an eventual total ban of cigarettes for individuals born in or after the year 2000.This is detailed in a separate 2010 research paper on phasing out tobacco, which argued that a fixed minimum age ban is likely to have limited success due to difficulties in enforcement and the range of cigarette sources available to youths.The paper, published in the medical journal BMJ, was co-authored by Dr Deborah Khoo, who was at the Department of Surgical Oncology in the National Cancer Centre Singapore.Ultimately, this proposal will lead to the phasing out of tobacco provision, without the short-term disruption that makes a sudden ban impracticable, the paper said, adding that more than 70 per cent of respondents in a survey supported the proposal.It is a simple, at-a-stroke initiative that removes the risk of being hostage to future changes in political or economic climate.On a policy level, the tobacco control research paper said Singapore can further reduce its smoking rate target to 5 per cent by 2035, closer to its longterm goal of being a nation of nonsmokers.This is similar to targets set by a handful of developed countries, including Canada (by 2035), New Zealand (by 2025) and Finland, which set the target lower at less than 2 per cent by 2040.Notably, these countries have similar or higher smoking prevalence rates than Singapore, which makes the push for Singapore to adopt a similar tobacco endgame target not only possible but also desirable, the paper said.NO MAGIC BULLETNevertheless, Dr van der Eijk said bringing down the smoking rate requires a multi-faceted response that includes addressing youth smoking, helping smokers quit, protecting against secondhand smoke, and dealing with the tobacco lobby.As such, there is no magic bullet and authorities need to adopt a range of comprehensive measures that, together, will bring down smoking rates over time, she added.Even if there was a magic bullet, the MP Mr Ng believes it would not be a blanketban on smoking.Were all adults now, he said. As 21-year-olds, you have the right to choose whether you want to smoke. Those rights should be preserved, but again it cannot affect others.NEA said it is mindful thatthere are smokers who may have been smoking for years, and inevitably find it tough to quit smoking overnight.\"Whether a smoker is smoking in a public place that is non-prohibited, or at home, we urge both smokers and the wider community to practise social graciousness and good neighbourliness,\" the spokesperson said.NEA said everyone has a part to play in upholding high standards of public health and maintaining a liveable environment in Singapore.\"We urge the community to take ownership and collective responsibility for our environment and cultivate positive social norms among fellow residents,\" the spokesperson added.\"For example, if you see someone smoking in a prohibited place, step forward and remind him or her to observe the laws and be considerate.\"Ultimately, Tom the smoker feels any decision about his habit would come from within. I feel like this is a personal choice, not based on any Government policy whatsoever, he said. If I quit, its for my own reasons.Editor's note: This article was updated on Nov 30 to add comments from Philip Morris."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

So, that leaves reducing assets as a final option. It can be unpalatable but arguably a necessary choice if a company wants to recapture its glory days of high returns on equity.THAT SHIP HAS SAILEDIn the case of Sembcorp Industries and Keppel Corp, the conditions for restructuring were already present - driven by changing consumer attitudes towards fossil fuel, the fluctuations in oil price and the rise of Chinese rig-builders which could offer more preferential credit terms due to the large amounts of liquidity they had access to from Chinese state lenders.However, COVID-19 accelerated this need for restructuring, as the pandemic adversely impacted the shipbuilding businesses of both groups. It not only reduced the demand for oil and gas exploration but also disrupted the supply of migrant workers who were crucial to their yard operations.Keppel CEO Loh Chin Hua confirmed last year that its offshore and marine unit faced major challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to contain its spread.To remain competitive, Keppel had to look for new markets. That is why in January, it said that its Keppel Offshore and Marine (O&M) unit would exit the rig-building business.The exit would allow the unit to become leaner and better able to focus on other areas such as clean energy, renewables, and gas solutions all of which are less labour-intensive businesses compared to offshore and marine.Keppel Corp added that it was exploring inorganic options for the O&M business, which is a euphemism for a merger, acquisitionor disposal. Keppel Corp, meanwhile, would focus on property development, telecommunicationsand asset management.As for Sembcorp, already in May 2020, it had reported the negative impact of the pandemic on its traditionally profitable energy and urban business units, in addition to the loss-making marine segment.In a media release then, the group acknowledged that the impact of COVID-19 and the reduction in economic activity as a result of lockdowns in multiple markets has since led to a decrease in energy demand and prices and, consequently, the underlying performance of the Energy business in 2020 is expected to be markedly lower than 2019.No wonder then, a month later, it announced selling off its marine business, which, in March, reported three consecutive years of losses.Shorn of its loss-making marine investment Sembcorp Industries should not only be more profitable, but it could be better positioned to capitalise on growing demand for energy generation and urban development.That was the rationale behind the split. Its shares might even be more appealing to investors, which could in turn raise its valuation.In fact, its valuation has already increased from an average of around 6.5 times earnings over the past decade to 7.7 times earnings more recently. Investors, it would appear, are prepared to now pay more for every dollar of profit that Sembcorp Industry makes.COVID HITS PROPERTY HARDFor CapitaLand, it was a realisation that investors favour asset-light real estate businesses with more predictable earnings over developers that are prone to the ups and downs of the property cycle.This realisation was heightened during the pandemic as the group took a big hit to its residential, retail and lodging business segments.Due to lockdowns in Singapore, China and other markets, the groups residential sales offices were forced to close, non-essential retail trades were unable to operate, and the occupancy of its lodging assets fell due to travel restrictions, it reported last year, as its first half net profit for 2020 fell by 89 per cent or nearly S$780 million.The losses from its property management business impacted its core property development work too.That is why in March the property conglomerate CapitaLand put forward a proposal to go asset-light by privatising its real estate business. It will also spin off its investment management arm into a separately-listed company.CLA Real Estate, which will own CapitaLand, will focus on property development, while stock-market listed CapitaLand Investment Management (CLIM) will adopt an asset-light model that should be able to earn more dependable, recurring income from its property investments.Similarly, SPH had to see its property business retail malls and student accommodation take a big hit last year due to COVID-19.For the financial year ended August 2020, the group suffered non-cash fair value losses of S$232 million as the valuation of its retail malls fell by S$196.5 million and that of its student accommodation assets by S$31.9 million.Fortunately, for SPH, these losses were mitigated by income from government schemes, including the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), to sustain the company.Media has been the lifeblood of SPH. But its media division has, nevertheless, been a noticeable drag on the groups performance for nearly a decade. In 2011, the division reported a healthy income of S$388 million on revenue of S$1.25 billion.Five years later, profit had shrunk by half to S$175 million on sales that had fallen to S$834 million. In 2020, COVID-19 also saw a 31.4 per cent declining in advertising revenue causing SPH Media to report a loss of S$11.4 million, while revenue had dropped further to S$445 million.This was despite SPH already laying off 140 staff last year from its media division. As the pandemic weakened companies financial positions and digital marketing became more ubiquitous, SPHs advertising revenue was likely to be worse hit going forward.The company had already been depending on its rising property business to bankroll its declining media division. Even if SPH investors were to accept the continued financing of a loss-making media unit, the question is if the less valuable property business could afford to do so.With retail and demand for student accommodation affected by the pandemic, and with the JSS and other schemes running out, SPHs property business would only suffer worse losses.Clearly, this equation was no longer viable.No wonder on May 6, SPH said it will hive off its media arm into a not-for-profit entity that will operate as a company limited by guarantee. The remaining listed business will focus on property, student accommodation and nursing homes.WHOS NEXT?These companies may not be the last local listed groups we hear of restructuring. Certainly, Singtel has already announced a strategic review of two US-based businesses including a digital marketing agency which has been badly impacted by COVID-19.Another sector that looks ripe for restructuring is the taxi business.It has already been disrupted by the entry of ride-hailing platforms that are, by comparison, asset-light and operate with more flexibility. But COVID-19 has seen the transport industry badly hit as lockdowns lead to lower passenger volumes.Over the last decade, cab company ComfortDelGro has reported around S$75 of revenue on every S$100 of asset employed in the business.While the company has still delivered a high return on shareholder equity, this has largely been through a high profit margin, rather than an efficient use of assets.An argument can be made for reducing its total assets, and cutting its margins, but still deliver an acceptable return on equity for shareholders.How have taxi drivers coped since COVID-19 hit our shores?

(Source: Mediacorp)SINGAPORE: With consumers and businesses gobbling up more data in an increasingly connected world, data centres are in hot demand. Packed with rows and rows of servers, they store, process and communicate data produced every single day, forming the backbone of a booming digital economy around the world.This demand will only increase, hastened by the COVID-19 pandemic and new technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.(The) technologies will drive demand for greater data and computing capacity, leading to a rise in data centre infrastructures, said Mr Richard Farrell, the Asia-Pacific director for cloud and data centre segment at power management firm Eaton.But data centres are also huge energy hogs everything from the servers, storage equipment and cooling infrastructures have a large appetite for electricity.The International Energy Agency estimates that the sector currently uses around 1 per cent of the worlds electricity. This figure could hit double-digits by 2030, making related emissions a problem.In Singapore, data centres accounted for about 7 per cent of the countrys total electricity consumption last year, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in a recent written answer to a parliamentary question.There are about 60 data centres in Singapore, according to a tally by research firm Structure Research.QUALITY, NOT QUANTITYThere has been a rapid increase in the number of data centres being approved to be constructed on industrial state land over the past five years, MTI said in a separate written parliamentary reply on Feb 1.Fourteen data centres with a total IT capacity of 768 megawatts were given the green light during that period, compared to 12 data centres carrying 307 megawatts in the preceding five years.With the industry being an intensive user of electricity and water, a temporary pause has since been imposed on the building of new data centres as local authorities mull a balance between environment sustainability and supporting business needs.The Government therefore decided to moderate the growth of data centres with a temporary pause on the release of state land for data centres, as well as the development of data centres on existing state land, MTIs reply said.It added that the industry was informed of the decision in 2019 and has been consulted on ideas for a more sustainable growth.We will strive for quality, not quantity this means we seek to anchor a range of data centres that can meet both industry and societys needs, are best in class in terms of resource efficiency, and that continuously innovate to push the boundaries of resource efficiency in a tropical climate, MTI said.The Government has said it intends to share its plans later this yearafter concluding its review.Industry experts told CNA that the Governments decision comes as no surprise, given the countrys land and power constraints.Singapore is not alone in doing so. Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, hit the brakes on new data centres in July 2019, citing strains on its property market and power networks. The ban was lifted after a year under conditions such as locating data centres in specific zones with limits on power use and floor space.Singapore is a relatively smaller city-country, when compared to the other tier-1 markets such as Tokyo, Sydney and Hong Kong. Yet we come in second in terms of IT capacity, said Ms Lim ChinYee, senior director of Asia-Pacific data centre solutions at CBRE.It is therefore important that Singapore ensures that the overall data centre ecosystem is environmentally sustainable, while balancing the need for growth.Mr Farrell thinks this offers Singapore a timely opportunity to invest in green technologies, higher-performance infrastructure and develop technology talent.This will help the country keep up with future expansion in data centre demand when the moratorium is lifted, he said.ANY IMPACT?But with supply being curbed at a time of booming demand, rental rates at data centres based on cost per kilowatt have surged by more than 30 per cent last year, said Mr Lynus Pook, Colliers senior director of industrial advisory in Asia.These rates have stayed low from 2016 to 2019, especially in 2018 when vacancy rates peaked at 40 per cent due to new supply.With the temporary pause in building new data centres, the vacancy rates have narrowed to 5 per cent in 2020, leading to some spill-over in demand to neighbouring countries such as (Malaysia) Johor Bahru, said Mr Pook. Inevitably, rental rates have increased by more than 30 per cent.Ms Lim expects rental rates to continue heading north over the next three years, given a tight supply and expectations that the moratorium on constructing new data centres will be lifted by 2022.Singapore has been a popular site to build data centres due to factors such as a reliable power grid and a business-friendly environment. So far, it remains the case even with the ongoing moratorium, industry observers said.For instance, Singapore came in second in a recent list of top data centre markets by Arcadis, coming just behind the United States, due to political stability, a well-educated workforce and the ability to attract major technology investments.Rather than the moratorium being considered off-putting for potential data center providers, it has forced them to rethink their current strategies and look for alternative models, as they have already started to do globally anyway, said Mr Richard Warburton, growth director for Southeast Asia at Arcadis.He pointed to announcements by companies such as Facebook and Amazon that will be tapping renewable energy to power their data centres in Singapore.Overall, it's unlikely that the moratorium will deter providers from investing in Singapore in the mid to long term, said Mr Warburton, adding that it is only natural for data centre operators to move into regional markets as part of their expansion plans.Alternative data centre hubs are emerging across the region in response to increasing demand and corporate strategies, rather than as a reaction to the moratorium, he added.WHY SINGAPORE?Industry players told CNA they are still keen to have more of their data centres located in Singapore.Tencent Cloud, for example, hopes to add one more to its current portfolio of two here, as Singapore remains a very important market to the companys strategic growth in Southeast Asia.Although land scarcity and regulations remain a challenge, we plan to build at least one more (data centre) in the country to meeting the growing demands from our customers, said Mr Poshu Yeung, senior vice-president of Tencent Cloud International.Equinix is set to open its fifth data centre in Singapore in the second half of the year. The site was acquired before the moratorium by local authorities.For the company, Singapore remains an attractive data centre hub in Asia Pacific, with advantages such as a strong subsea cable network and low risks of natural disasters outweighing the challenges.The country is also located at the centre of an explosive growth for the industry, said Ms Leong Yee May, managing director for Equinix South Asia.Across Asia-Pacific, there has been tremendous growth in demand for data centres and this trend is likely to continue, she said, citing reports that expect the regions data centre colocation market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 8 per cent between 2018 and 2024.As we close off the financial year of 2020, Equinix reported a 14 per cent year-on-year increase in our Asia-Pacific revenue growth. Singapore contributes significantly to that and this shows that there continues to be demand for cloud connectivity and digital infrastructure as enterprises transform digitally, added Ms Leong.That said, it takes 18 to 24 months to get a data centre up and running and there could be diminishing returns if the current construction halt persists for long, said Mr Mark Smith, Digital Realtys managing director for Asia Pacific.If we can build another data centre in Singapore, we would tomorrow. But even when the moratorium on approvals is lifted, it still takes 18 to 24 months to build a data center, he said.There will be a delay and I do think you start to get a law of diminishing returns the longer the moratorium continues.THE WAY FORWARDIndustry players like Digital Realty and Equinix said they have been in touch with local authorities with suggestions on how their industry can be more environmentally friendly.Last month, Digital Realty powered on its third and largest data centre in Singapore, which it described as one of its most sustainable in the region.Called the Digital Loyang II or SIN12, it includes a new cooling system to help minimise evaporation losses and improve water-use efficiency. Turbine generators, instead of diesel engines, are also used to enable cleaner emissions while getting the same amount of energy output.Operating a data centre in Singapore has its unique challenges, said Mr Smith. For example, Singapores tropical climate means that 35 to 40 per cent of the energy consumed by a data centre here goes to cooling.New solutions will hence be crucial. Digital Realty is currently partnering CoolestDC, a company set up by a research team from the National University of Singapore, to test the latters liquid cooling idea.Using CoolestDCs liquid and two-phase cooling solutions can result in up to 30 per cent savings in the total energy consumption for data centres. Related to this will be the significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and water consumption, it told CNA.Plans are also ongoing to upgrade Digital Realtys other data centres SIN10 at Jurong and SIN11 at Loyang so as to improve their power usage effectiveness (PUE), said Mr Smith.These currently have a PUE of 1.56 and 1.32, respectively, compared with SIN12s 1.25.The PUE is a measure of a data centres energy efficiency, where the ratio of total energy used is divided by energy consumed for information technology activities. The theoretical ideal PUE is 1, where 100 per cent of electricity consumption goes toward useful computation.Equinix said its data centres in Singapore run fully on renewable energy and are certified to meet rigorous environmental and energy standards.Innovative technologies have also been deployed, such as a temperature control system that has improved the PUE of its first data centre here by 15 per cent. Its third data centre also uses recycled rainwater and is installed with solar photovoltaic systems to supplement power from the local grid.Similarly, the upcoming data centre will have several green features, including motion-activated LED lights, automated control and regulation of motors, as well as using NEWater for cooling purposes.At Tencent Cloud, it said it preferentially selects sites rich in waste-to-energy recovery and clean energy resources and maximises the utilization of green energy.It has also developed artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies for capacity control and PUE optimisation. As a result, energy efficiency levels at its data centres have improved from 1.8 to 1.2 over the years, said Mr Yeung.Other ideas are also being explored, such as how Keppel Data Centres is thinking of havingfloating data centres out at sea.Mr Farrell said the shift to sustainable data centre growth is both an environmental and business imperative.Business leaders will need to demonstrate how achieving such sustainability targets can deliver long-term value to stakeholders and consumers, in order to secure the buy-in needed to get these projects off the ground, he added.Proving the viability and long-term success of such investments will serve as a catalyst for others to explore more new solutions to achieve their sustainability goals.Mr Pook thinks local authorities will likely be selective in their approval process moving forward, with other considerations such as an operators value-add apart from capital expenditure and job creation possibilities.Clearly the authorities do not want the Singapore to just be a data warehouse. We want meaningful data to be stored in Singapore, he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The ride hailing-to-food delivery giant is a dominant force and a household name in Southeast Asia. It is talk of the town on Wall Street.Though it is worth noting that the valuations are eye-popping and the questions are increasing about the viability of SPACs.Jim Cramer, the host of the famous CNBC show, Mad Money, cast a strong dose of caution on SPACs and investments in tech companies often. But hes talking up the Grab deal. I dont like the price right now, but if you wait for some weakness youve got my permission to do some buying, he said last week.The fact that Grabs acquirer, Altimeter, has pledged a three year lock up on its shares also shows a healthy dollop of confidence.Not too long ago, American investors were clamouring to get their hands on anything to do with China and Chinese companies were flocking to US equity markets to capitalise on the enthusiasm.The depth and sophistication of the US market is still unrivalled, despite the rise of its Shanghai equivalent. But attention is now turning to Southeast Asia in a big way.THE SOUTHEAST ASIA GROWTH STORYThat comes as little surprise in some ways.With a population nearing 700 million, the size of the market is massive. Its half that of China, but consumers are digital natives and young. Looking just at Indonesia, the median age is 30.2 years old.Digital consumption, or those purchasing a product or service online, is growing rapidly. Bain and Co previously forecast that the number of digital consumers in Southeast Asia would reach 310 million by 2025.It reached that number last year, five years early. To put that in context, these 310 million digital consumers represent about half of Southeast Asias population. 40 million people in the region came online for the first time last year.Grab, Gojek, SEA Group (Shopee) and Lazada are all plugging into this trend with ride hailing, online shopping and delivery and increasingly getting into other areas like banking and insurance. Shopee was the third most downloaded app globally in the shopping category in 2020.Of course, the markets in Southeast Asia can be very different. Sometimes, there is market dominance in certain countries and sectors, as homegrown players like Gojek may achieve in Indonesia.Yet what is more remarkable is how many of these new big techs have demonstrated an ability to perform well in many of the disparate markets in Southeast Asia, in a way that creates a natural barrier to entry to other new challengers.Southeast Asias online retail market now accounts for 5 per cent of its total, but its on a rapid tear. E-commerce gross merchandise value grew 23 per cent per year from 2018 to 2020, faster than the compounded annual growth rate of Chinas, Indias, and the United States GMV during the same period, according to Bain.The fact that Grab wants to stay focused on this massive ASEAN growth story, rather than spread out even further, is saying something.ALTERNATIVE TO CHINA PLAYSIn contrast, Chinese companies listed on US markets now represent bigger risks for investors. As US-China geopolitical rivalry heats up, damp sentiment is weighing on Chinese firms listing in the US. There is a rise of Chinese firms listing on the US markets so far this year but geopolitical concerns are causing lacklustre debuts.Just as Grab was getting ready to receive billions in its SPAC listing, Alibaba was hit with a record antitrust fine of US$2.8 billion for what the state called abusing its market dominance. The increasingly assertive stance of the Chinese government towards tech players is part of a big shift in the regulation of Chinas digital space.Interestingly the Gojeks and Grabs of the world have been particularly good at staying on the right sides of governments as regulators play catch up with their outsized growth.Grab started out by tapping into the existing fleet of taxis, helping customers to just Grab any taxi available, rather than call different companies. Now it offers a suite of services, including private-hire cars. This was a starkly different approach to Uber, which went head-to-head with taxi companies, sparking societal concerns and lawsuits.For Gojek, the pivotal decision to initially concentrate on ojeks (motorcycle taxis), for example, was doubly context-savvy: It skirted direct competition with Jakartas existing taxi industry, while dodging the nations transport regulations, which applied only to four-wheeled vehicles.By the time the app introduced four-wheelers in 2016, Gojek had already cultivated a public profile as a boon to the local economy and a patriotic symbol of Indonesian progress.SUPER APPS CUT THROUGH SUPER COMPLEXITYFor all its merit, Southeast Asia is complex. Transport infrastructure is often hard to negotiate and services difficult to deliver, especially in Indonesia.Apps like Gojek have helped riders enormously by opening up a customer base to optimise where they locate themselves and offered them other delivery jobs when ride demand is low during the day.The approach of the super apps also differs widely from the Amazons and Ubers of the world, which concentrate on a few services and do them really well.A big population of willing servers helps Grab and Gojek add more services and spread them out over a wider area. A deep and local understanding of Southeast Asian nuances helps.Instead of getting into these segments itself, its interesting that Amazon is investing big in cloud computing to support growing tech development in Southeast Asia rather than try to eat Lazada or Gojeks lunch.There are cultural nuances too. Shopee is capturing eyeballs with bargain hunting and flash deals. Such social commerce (group and gamified buying) is the next frontier in e-commerce.There are two main reasons for the increasing interest in social commerce.The first is that people are growing weary of big techs advertising-driven approach to e-commerce. For example, users are growing tired of being bombarded by ads and influencers telling them what to buy.Second is that privacy concerns are weighing on consumers and legislators minds. The more customer-driven group buying models avoid this approach.The super apps are also backed by huge investments of US and Chinese money, the investors content to duke it out through their proxies rather than compete directly.Other tech unicorns in the region, such as Traveloka and Property Guru are also considering listing through blank-cheque SPACs in the US and Gojek is consolidating its position by merging with Tokopedia, which will make it a transport and e-commerce giant.The competition is heating up and it looks like were just at the beginning.As my colleague, Guoli Chen, Strategy Professor at INSEAD has pointed out before, one major reason for Grabs listing is its need for additional capital to maintain its leading position in ride hailing, food delivery and digital finance, to defend itself from incursions by Sea, the largest tech firm in Southeast Asia.Finally, these listings may benefit the entrepreneurial ecosystem more broadly. Major liquidity events, like the Grab listing, will also enable exits for private investors, which typically unlock capital to start other companies and make other investments.Jason Davis is an Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise at INSEAD."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: Space Furniture)One of the most discussed topics during the pandemic was about space. Homes became refuges during lockdowns around the world; office layouts went from dissolving barriers to physicaldistancing; outdoor spaces were emphasised; and the kitchen became more hardworking than ever as it birthed scores of home bakers and amateur gourmands who channelled their frustrations of isolation into making gastronomic comforts.These spaces, where one sat, studied, worked and slept, came into the spotlight. As people worked from or stayed home, they became more conscientious about study desks and ergonomic chairs, and adornment and shelving to frame Zoom meeting backdrops.Prior to the pandemic, customers took a longer time to shop and commit to purchase [as they were not home 24/7] or could try to source from overseas when they travelled, said Jennifer Soh, general manager, sales and marketing of Space Furniture Asia.The furniture retailers flagship known as Space Asia Hub is in Singapores Bencoolen Street, while a satellite showroom is located in Kuala Lumpurs Bangsar district.A post shared by Space Furniture Asia (@spacefurnitureasia)During the pandemic, especially during the Circuit Breaker period, customers stuck at home realised how important the home hadbecome, and started paying more attention to it, adding pieces of furniture like tables they could multi-task on.Sales of sofas, beds, armchairs, chairs and storage items also increased, and there were more queries into well-organised, imported Italian kitchen systems as people spent more time cooking at home, she added. Wellbeing in the home became something to note.A post shared by Space Furniture Asia (@spacefurnitureasia)The funds meant for travel and other luxury indulgences seem to have channelled back to peoples safe havens home sweet home. While the tendency was to model your home when you moved into a new property or remodel after living in it for some years, we saw consumers proactively adding new pieces of statement furniture into their existing setup or playing around with the layout of the spaces. This helped to refresh their environments and take away the monotony of living in the new normal, explained Soh.Prior to the pandemic, customers took a longer time to shop and commit to purchase or could try to source from overseas when they travelled. Jennifer SohSTAYING THE COURSEGiven the unpredictable mood the pandemic seeded, as well as the changing roles of home and office, it was important that retailers remained consistent and relevant.We do this by providing the same inspiration, and comprehensive experience and solutions customers have grown to expect delivered in a manner that is innovative yet familiar and assuring, said Space Furniture Asias general manager Derek Lim.It was timely that the retailer, which originated in Australia, had just introduced its online store. Business via the website has been encouraging despite the economic instability. While online furniture retail was less popular a decade ago, this is no longer the case, especially with smaller items such as accessories, lights and chairs. Customers are better travelled, and also informed via retailers websites and social media.Many come to Space Asia Hub often with a particular brand and product in mind. We then help them envision how these products can bring out the best in their living areas, and evoke a sense of belonging and home. As online purchases have increased for us similar to other retail sectors we aim to continue exploring new ways of improving the customer experience, said Lim. In the furniture retail industry, it is largely the same, with the cancellation of large-scale events such as the Milan furniture fair, held every April. There, furniture brands and product designers could make a lasting impact with impressive exhibits or speak directly to visitors.This time, the migration to online marketing became full scale, with furniture brands employing social media, as well as organising Instagram talks and webinars to reach out and connect virtually with end-users, as well asprofessionals like interior designers and architects. New products responding to the pandemic were also birthed. For example, Glas Italia introduced SKIN a free-standing glass panel screen that had the dual functions of separation and protection, offering elegance and style while serving a functional purpose, said Lim.BRICKS-AND-MORTAR STILL HAS A PLACEDespite the shift to a more digital realm, Space Asia Hubs physical store remained just as important. Customers seeking specific furniture pieces still rely on the expertise of sales consultants for processes like the configuration of modules and the selection of finishes.Initiatives such as the retailers newly renovated section The Architects Apartment (conceived in collaboration with Italian furniture manufacturer Living Divani), continue to make the showroom a place of discovery, and let customers envision their furniture in a realistic setting. Living Divani is one of the newest brands that Space Furniture Asia has introduced to offer customers more choices. Another two are Edra and Baxter; the former known for its experimental but comfortable forms, while the latter, for itsbuttery soft leather furniture. They were selected for their superior workmanship, quality, design ethos and compatibility with other brands in the store.On what customers are drawn to, Soh shared that brands like B&B Italia and Poliform remain perennially popular, especially with the younger crowd in their thirties who appreciate the modern looks and extensive range that can dress the living, dining, bedroom and outdoor areas. B&B Italias Charles sofa, designed in 1997 by Italian architect Antonio Citterio, has been one of the bestsellers internationally and in Singapore.Older buyers in their early forties and up are drawn to more sophisticated brands like Maxalto and Giorgetti. These well-exposed customers have a discerning eye and are willing to pay for good craftsmanship and quality.Then there are also buyers who are highly loyal to certain brands, having grown up with positive experiences of these products in their parents homes, and continue to look to these brands when dressing up their own, observed Soh.Customers today are also more concerned with ecological and societal values. Even before the pandemic, sustainability and biophilic designs were widely encouraged, but it gathered pace during the pandemic as the world witnessed the positive effects of nature during lockdowns. In response came products such as Kartells iconic Componibili storage unit that now comes in a new biodegradable plastic version made from agricultural waste. B&B Italias Camaleonda sofas feet are made from FSC-certified beech wood, meaning they are sourced from suppliers who practice responsible forest management.But being sustainable stretches beyond eco-friendly furniture, said Soh.Investing in good quality, timeless products that eschew the buy-and-throw-away consumerist culture is as important. Among them, the works of designers like Antonio Citterio, Jean Marie Massaud, Piero Lissoni and Patricia Urquiola stay relevant across different settings and times, which is why they are commonly found in design magazines and homes of the style-attuned. Such items should be seen as investments that last many years, or generations even.As with everything else, people now have time to think about what matters to them most.

Money Mind takes a look at how this niche property market is heating up.Boxes containing vials of Covishield, AstraZeneca-Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine are seen stacked inside a cold storage room at India's Serum Institute in Pune on Jan 22, 2021.(Photo: AFP/Punit Paranjpe)SINGAPORE: Cold storage logistics is an industry that has gained prominence because of the opportunities in vaccine transport.This was once a niche property sector, but with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating the demand for cold storage facilities, the global cold storage market - which was worth an estimated US$107 billion in 2020 - is expected to grow to more than US$290 billion by 2028, according to a new study conducted by Grand View Research.The Asia Pacific is a growing part of that market with anticipated annual growth of more than 10 per cent. But that growth is from a low base, with even the regions most advanced economies, trailing behind western countries.In the United States, cold storage space per capita was 0.577 cubic metres in 2020.In Japan, it was 0.339 cubic metres and in Australia, 0.382.In comparison, the Philippines and Indonesia have less than 0.04 cubic metres of cold storage space per capita.The shortcomings of this became clear during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the need to transport vaccine supplies arose.The whole cold supply chain is very fragmented, so as soon as we had the pandemic impacting the demand, we saw a squeeze,\" said Mr Michael Ignatiadis, head of supply chain and logistics solutions, Asia Pacific, at JLL.\"An example is Vietnam. Its the third-largest seafood exporter in the world. But during COVID-19, orders were suddenly cancelled, so up to 50 per cent of orders were cancelled. That led to a stockpile of products and the cold storage supply was not sufficient to accommodate this surplus.Mr Wong Xian Yang is head of research, Singapore, at Cushman and Wakefield. He explained why there is currently a limited supply of cold storage space.Most of these cold stores tend to be owned by end users or by third-party logistics players. The properties that are owned by investors, and the institutional grade cold stores are relatively small. Also, the pandemic has affected construction activities, so new supplies are taking a while to come onto the market.In Singapore, cold storage warehouses account for just 10 per cent of the stock of Grade A warehouse space, according to Colliers.But while investors might see opportunities in limited supply and increased demand, industry experts cautioned that there are also risks.Capital expenditure is higher, and because of the power consumption, operating expenses are also higher. So it is more risky compared to a conventional warehouse, because if you have a vacancy, cost will be higher than the market average,\" said Mr Wong.\"But of course with higher risks, theres higher returns. Rents can be about 50 to 100 per cent higher than a conventional warehouse. And the leases also tend to be longer about five to 10 years, compared to three years for conventional warehouses.\"In a survey of investor intentions, CBRE found that cold storage was ranked as the second-most preferred real estate asset, after data centres.CBRE said that investors were attracted by the longer leases and hence stable incomes.Before the pandemic, trends in the food industry were already driving the growth of the cold storage market.Cushman and Wakefields Wong identified three main factors driving the demand for cold storage facilities: Rising food consumption, especially of imported food; changing consumer preferences; and growing accessibility of higher quality fresh and perishable goods.Growth in the sector is also being driven by the transformation of the retail sector.Online supermarket shopping has seen robust growth.The rise of omnichannel distribution or retail that integrates different methods of shopping is also driving up demand for cold storage.Since late 2020, the cold chain has played a vital role in the roll-out of one of the most sought after international commodities COVID-19 vaccines.But despite this, experts think that the growth of cold storage facilities will still be driven by long-term trends in the food industry.\"When vaccines are imported, they are quickly distributed out to the population.So in terms of storage, its not such a big market,\" said Mr Wang.\"I think the bulk of demand still comes from the F&B,\" he said.The biomedical sector is also expected to contribute to demand long-term.What we are seeing is the rise of Asia Pacific life sciences is going to give us the extra boost of super high quality cold storage in the coming years. Its not only for vaccines, but also for wider medical products. So the pandemic is the catalyst for us to develop more good quality cold storage, said Mr Henry Chin, head of research, APAC, at CBRE.Currently, rental prices for cold storage facilities are higher than normal warehouse facilities. Industry watchers believe asking prices can go higher still.Currently, in Singapore, rents for cold store logistics warehouses range between S$2.50 to S$3.50 per sq ft per month.\"The other asset classes, like hotel and retail, investors are moving out of those. Definitely the yields in logistics are better,\" said Mr Ignatiadis.\"Now its majority might be owner-occupied, but this trend is shifting.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Illustration: Rafa Estrada)SINGAPORE: Most days are a blur for 34-year-old delivery driver Mr Hamry, who zips across estatesto around 130 homes each day,bearing items that residents have been eagerly awaiting: Their online shopping orders.During peak sale periods, that can go up to as many as 270 deliveries a day.At thosetimes, his stress levels canspike even more because of one major challenge - finding somewhere he can park in the private estates he covers.Its too narrow. You see all those cars parked on one side of the road, then its very hard for you to find one slot.\"(If you park where you can), you hope that owner doesnt open the gate, if not they horn at you or ask you to shift.Even when delivering in public housing estates, the parking grace periods are sometimes not long enough, he said. And in some areas without established lots, one has to watch out for the fearsome summons auntie - or parking enforcement officer.Fellow driver, 41-year-old Sandy Lim, said condominiums pose inconveniences too. For certain condos, the intercom activates the lift. So even if in the whole blockyou have just five deliveries, you need to call via the intercom five times.His companys warehouse in Tampines is also a considerable distance from his delivery areas in Ang Mo Kio and Bishan.As Singapore continues to embrace e-commerce, such issues are likely to become more pressing, creating a need for even moresolutions that will likely change theurban landscape.For instance, what if residential areas - including private estates - hada central delivery point, cutting the need for door-to-door visits?Would building morewarehouses a stones throw from residential areas improve efficiency?What if there was even an automated underground parcel delivery network?Over the past few years, the popularity of e-commerce -the buying and selling of goods and services online - has soared.The COVID-19 pandemic has turbocharged the trend, as restrictions on mobility drove more people to online channels for uninterrupted access to shopping, food delivery or groceries, among others.In fact, e-commerce values in Singaporeskyrocketed by 87 per cent in 2020 compared to the year before, according to a report by Google, Temasek andBain Southeast Asia.Regular mega sale events continue to fuel the online boom, with as many as 200 million items sold in a single day across the region.During the recent National Day weekend sale, e-commerce platform Lazada told CNA that it notched a 70 per cent year-on-year increase in sales on Aug 8.Shopee said it sawa five-foldincrease in orders made in the first 12 hours ofthat day, compared to a year ago.As a whole, e-commerce values could hit a whopping US$4 billion this year and double by 2025, according to Bain Analysis. But this could create challenges for densely packed Singapore, said experts.The issues faced by drivers such as Mr Hamry and Mr Lim are just some examples of how existing urban systemsare being disrupted, said Ms Iyn Ang, CPG Consultants senior vice president of urban planning.This is particularly due to a lack of supportive infrastructure to accommodate new delivery services, she said.Cities like New York have faced similar issues, with reports showing increasing competition for space indense residential and commercial areas, she said.As e-commerce grows, burgeoning deliveries could also clog up roads, said Professor Lau Hoong Chuin from Singapore Management University (SMU). There are already far more vehicles for goods than for regular passengers, he noted. Official figures show there were more than 140,000 goods vehicles, compared to about 15,700 taxis and more than 71,000 private-hire vehicles in 2020.The use of motorbikes for deliveries has also increased exponentially, undeniably, said Mr Lau, whose work focuses on using artificial intelligence and data to improve logistics.Among (all the platforms such as) GrabFood, Deliveroo, foodpanda, you already see that they combine more than 24,000 such riders.Imagine if each of them makes 20 deliveries per day, minimum, youll get easily half a million trips. That gives you a sense of how busy our roads are.Anecdotally, you also seefar more delivery riders on the roads these days, he said, adding thattaxis and private cars are also increasingly being used as couriers.Adapting infrastructure to the rise of e-commerce could also better protect drivers and riders, who are at risk of getting into accidents on roads or shared paths as they rush for deliveries, said Professor Sing Tien Foo, the director of the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS).Overall, a set of short-term and long-term interventions are needed to integrate logistics infrastructure into the existing urban fabric, said CPGs Ms Ang.Authorities are already examining the rise of e-commerce and what it could mean for urban landscapes and systems.The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) told CNA that the Government is studying how trends such as changing consumer behaviours and the increase in e-commerce have evolved.This will be one factor to consider amid an ongoing review of Singapores long-term land use plans, which will guide development over the next 50 years and beyond.For now, initiatives are under way to improve last-mile delivery, which is the final leg of the process until the parcel gets to your door.Authorities have already rolled out a nationwide parcel delivery locker network, which will have about 1,000 lockers across the island by the end of the year.Several pilots have also enlisted robots to deliver parcels, groceries and meals in residential areas.And in the coming months, some residents could benefit from a new pilot being developed by agencies and last-mile delivery firms.Under the pilot, certain car park spaces could be used for the unloading, sorting and distribution of e-commerce parcels to households, URA told CNA.This could help delivery firms boost delivery capacity, improve efficiency and keep up standards, especially amid growing delivery volumes, it said. The initiative could also involve \"walkers\" people who collect these parcels and bring them on foot to your door.URA said the aim is to launch the pilot later this year and see if and how it may be rolled out on a wider scale.People could also see central delivery pointsfor food or goodsbecoming a default feature in developments, such as condominiums, said IREUS Prof Sing.Some developers are already looking at this, especially for luxury projects that are more exclusive because they dont want so many (delivery riders) coming into the condominium, he said.You dont want to see so many people coming in and out, or sometimes they press the wrong button and call the wrong unit. Such delivery points at lobbies have also become common in places like China, he said.Though this would meanthe end of door-step deliveries, Prof Sing said this little inconvenience can create a lot more conducive environment, adding that it is also better for security reasons.Delivery driver Mr Hamry agreed such an initiative would certainly make life easier.Professor Mark Goh, director of industry research at NUS The Logistics Institute Asia Pacific, suggested that Singapore could see more mobile lockers.An example of theseare trucks from e-commerce platform ezbuy, which invites a mass of customers to meet at certain locations and times to collect their parcels.Thats a nice innovation for Singapore in that you save on infrastructure cost, infrastructure space, and yet give the assurance of security and custody of goods.All these developments would be crucial, because the last mile is usually the most inefficient part of the urban logistics network, consuming up to 75 per cent of costs, said Prof Goh.These moves would thus manage costs and shrink carbon footprints, he said.On a broader estate level, having dedicated parking for delivery vehicles and pick-up or drop-off zones with time limits would also help, said CPGs Ms Ang.Of all the sectors that have been disrupted by e-commerce, one of the biggest question marks hangs over the future of malls.With e-commerce, retailers no longer need to be in prime, convenient, or even physical locations. Tough competition from online channels has continually pushed retail rents lower over the years.Previous models of urban planning, which might have estimated that malls had a catchment of a 5km-radius, for example, also dont work anymore, said Mr Tan Shee Tiong, an adjunct associate professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore (NUS).Mr Tan, who is also CEO of architecture firmInteractive Architects Planners, added that land use allocations will change because of this.And though malls will not disappear, their formats will evolve.With e-commerce, you fulfill your needs, you finish your transaction, but theres no experience involved, said Mr Jacky Cheng, the director of project development for Asia Pacific at JERDE, an architecture and urban planning firm.At the end of the day, human beings are social creatures - whether want to be seen or you want to do something, you still want to have interaction, he said.As physical retail wanes, Mr Cheng believes stores will be used as a campus to display their products and teach people about them. An example would be the Apple store, he said.He also believes it will be key to blur the lines and give malls different functions to attract different users.CPGs Ms Ang echoed this, saying retail land use should be integrated with recreational and community facilities atdistrict levels to prop up visitorship.URA acknowledged that e-commerce potentially leaves room for traditional retail spaces to transform beyond a simple point-of-sale and provide more experiential activities.But it added that while e-commerce could lower demand for shop space, not everything is suited for online retailing such as services provided in beauty salons.It stressed that authorities will continue to monitor trends in the economy, business models and the retail market closely, and take these into account when calibrating the amount of land to safeguard and release for commercial use.Another element that Singapore's malls have not quite prepared for is the explosion of food delivery, said IREUS Prof Sing.With more delivery riders zipping in and out of malls, combined with safe-distancing measures, workflows and indoor traffic must be relooked, he said.Do people need to walk all the way to level fouror the basement to pick up food? What if restaurants are in different locations?Having a dedicated pick-up point would work, but it might cost developers space and rent revenue, said Prof Sing. Nevertheless, there are upsides such as reducing crowds and congestion, which might translate into some savings in business operations.Some players have already started thinking about this issue.In June, Grab began a trial of an autonomous mobile robot at Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ) Mall to consolidate food orders and bring them to a collection point.It was predicted to shave off between five to 15 minutes of the usual time taken to navigate shopping malls and collect each order, the firm said.Agencies are monitoring such developments and will work with the private sector to facilitate them, said URA.To support the online food delivery boom, cloud kitchens will also feature more heavily in the landscape, said Prof Sing. These are used to prepare food exclusively for take-away or delivery orders.Some F&B operators might consider downsizing in malls, to transfer that space to a cloud kitchen elsewhere which can better deal with rising demand from across the island, he said.In response to growing interest in cloud kitchens, URA told CNA it has recently carved out new guidelines specifically for setting these up.Dont be surprisedifdistribution centres or warehouses start to emerge in more neighbourhoods too, said experts.Typically, these industrial developments are kept tucked away from urban and residential areas. But it would be good to have these closer to demand centres where the client isto cut down on travelling, said Prof Sing.For one, CPGs Ms Ang suggested having multi-storey warehouses with small footprints in urban areas - noting that cities, such as Seattle in the US, have started doing this.You can also expect to see more \"microfulfilment centres or pick-up facilities in neighbourhoods here,as such an approach is eco-friendlier and cheaper, she said.This was a suggestion welcomed by delivery driver Mr Lim. If your vehicle cannot accept so many parcels, you have the luxury of finishing off whatever is in your vehicle, then going back to the warehouse to pick more up.If your warehouse is in Jurong and youre delivering in Pasir Ris, you cannot expect the driver to come back halfway through the journey to get more!Ms Ang also mooted carving out dedicated delivery lanes or shared mobility lanes, to ensure safety and convenience for riders using sustainable delivery transportation, such as electric cargo bikes.Making these routes shaded, with resting stations to boot, will further encourage these modes of transport, thus avoiding the increase of fast vehicular traffic.NUS Mr Tan added that road space is already limited, and forcing delivery riders on motorcycles and bicycles to jostle with bigger vehicles will pose a problem.One change might be to cut the number of lanes for cars or buses, possibly freeing up one lane for bikes and delivery drivers, he said.Feasibility aside, he added that this would only be one change out of many, eventually setting up for a future where roads are dominated by autonomous vehicles doing deliveries instead.Singapores urban logistics system or the way these goods are moved must also change, as the scene is currently very fragmented, said SMUs Prof Lau.We have different companies serving different communities, all trying to get business and doing their deliveries. Its very uncoordinated and very unoptimised, he said.To remedy this, Prof Lau has pushed for a national platform that coordinates deliveries to malls a project called the Collaborative Urban Delivery Optimisation platform, which he worked on together with authorities.But it hasnt quite taken off, as the push to coordinate the delivery is not there at a national level, he said.To roll it out operationally requires a lot of support. Companies will need to cooperate, and the Government will need to come in with some incentives to get them to subscribe to the system.Apart from autonomous vehicles, drones are another promising frontier being explored.This might be tricky as it would require implementing an entire traffic system in the air, among other issues, said NUS Mr Tan, who has four decades of planning experience.Instead, if he had it his way, there would be a high-speed delivery network underground, like a mini MRT in future.Imagine a network of underground delivery tubes, each up to a metre in diameter, with stops every 100m or 200m.He likened it to a pneumatic systemfor waste collection that is already being rolled out in estates such as Punggol. Thisinvolves a network of \"vacuum-type\"pipesunderground.So goods can easily be done with some sort of conveyor belt not necessarily being sucked away in a tube system just like a mini MRT system running all over Singapore.So just deliver there and you go to a collection point and take your things, thats all I think this is all coming, said Mr Tan.One more suggestion from Prof Lau for the future: Why not form a coalition between major food delivery platforms, for instance?They all do their own thing and they do a good job But we have to find a way to encourage them to come together to share resources, such that you serve east, I serve west the resulting number of trips will be much less.He pointed to code-sharing between airlines as an example of how this would work.But he also acknowledged that this is easier said than done, given barriers such as a lack of trust and the complexity of cost-sharing.Singapore has much to learn about adapting to e-commerce, said the experts, adding that economies such as China have delivery infrastructure and systems that are more advanced.The phenomenon itself is more mature there too. China is set to be the first country where e-commerce sales outweigh brick-and-mortar retail in 2021, according to research firm eMarketer.In contrast, Singapores online sales only made up less than a fifth of total retail sales, excluding motor vehicles, in June this year.Still, the rise of e-commerce will be here for a long time to come, said Prof Lau, adding that this also means a lot more scope for stakeholders to work together to improve.At the same time, the phenomenonis only one piece of the puzzle, as other trends to be navigated include an ageing population and environmental challenges, said NUS' Mr Tan.Singapore has \"all the attributes\" to be number one in many areas including increative city planningand \"we should do it, he urged.Prof Goh added: \"It's about how farwe want to venture in the game of innovation.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(File photo: Sutrisno Foo)SINGAPORE: The Singapore Government took on an extraordinary role since last year when COVID-19 hit to keep companies afloat and workers employed.They foresaw early warning signs of a collapse in employment with the upending of Singapores labour market in the first quarter of last year when the pandemic struck our shores. The overall unemployment rate quickly hit a high of 3.6 per cent in September 2020 while the citizen unemployment rate matched the global financial crisis high of 4.9 per cent in the same month. This is a far cry from the OECD average of a high of 8.75 per cent last year.Government assistance helped mitigate disruptions to the labour market by aiding companies to retain rather than retrench workers during this period of economic uncertainty. Most notable was the Jobs Support Scheme, which offset the wages of local employees. There were also efforts to retrain employees to pivot to new industries and jobs, as well as efforts to keep youth unemployment in check via the SGUnited Traineeship programme. Add to that the creation of temporary jobs - temperature screeners, COVID-19 test swabbers, contact tracers, contractors implementing safe management measures and safe-distancing ambassadors - that have cushioned the coronavirus negative impact on our domestic labour market. With the nearly 15,000 temporary jobs springing up due to the pandemic, whether in the public sector or government-funded short-term roles, the function of government also partially evolved from lender of last resort to employer of last resort and facilitator of Singapores largest, fastest macroeconomic restructuring exercise.But as Singapore reopens and prepares to live normally with an endemic COVID-19, the supply of such jobs will likely decline. While I do not foresee a blunt pullback of government assistance, the Jobs Growth Incentive, which supported more than 270,000 new local hires by 42,000 employers as of February, will run out by end-September 2021. The task of temperature-screening, for example, is no longerneeded in public places as of last Thursday. For this group of workers, what will life hold for them as demand starts to wind down? The first, and possibly the most natural, recourse is for many to return to their old jobs. Already, with the anticipated re-opening of international travel, the airline industry has begun recalling some furloughed aircrew and other staff. According to data from the Ministry of Manpower, resident employment continued to grow in the second quarter, outpaced by the continued decline in non-resident employment as departing workers were not replaced due to COVID-19-related border restrictions. Job vacancies are rising steadily, hitting a high of 68,400 job vacancies in March, pushing the job vacancy-to-unemployed ratio back up to 0.96. While still shy of the 1.02 back in the pre-coronavirus first quarter of 2019, it is a big improvement from the low of 0.55at the recession trough of the second quarter of 2020 and suggests aggregate labour demand is gradually healing. In this instance, the biggest obstacle towards hiring would hence be frictional unemployment - the result of job-seekers looking out for employment opportunities until they find a suitable role. We expect a fair share of these 15,000 temporary workers to eventually land jobs given the rising number of job vacancies, with frictions in matching hirers and workers the main obstacle for this group.The Workforce Singapore and NTUCs Employment and Employability Institute can accelerate this process of job matching and help job seekers find employment quicker. Platforms like the 24 SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres in HDB estates and MyCareersFuture portal can facilitate the job search process. The second option is a shift in duties for workers who stay on in temporary roles. For example, while there is no need for temperature screeners eventually, workers may still be required onsite to check for vaccination status. With the expansion of more regular testing in multiple locations, especially for workers in higher-risk industries interacting with the public like healthcare, eldercare, childcare, at the borders and other frontline work, swabbers and contract-tracing personnel will continue to be in demand for now. Staff wishing to remain employed in their current roles must undergo retraining and relocation to where these tasks are most performed in the new normal. Still, technological progress may continue to create economies of scale in employing capital over labour, which may curb demand for workers in this capacity. Already, some malls have erected check-in gantries minimising the need for staff on-site. However, because of inertia and uncertainty over how long such pandemic measures are needed and if they will change, such roles are not expected to be cut drastically in the near-term. That should buy time for workers to search for other jobs or retrain to be more employable in the new normal. But eventually, self-testing kits and new COVID-19 technology may render these tasks obsolete.Therein lies the key as the Singapore economy rebounds and demand for labour increases, this is the perfect opportunity to embrace a fresh start.For these 15,000 temporary workers this may be their best shot to find employment in a new industry away from their previous careers, upskill themselves in a way they never thought possible. Currently, hiring intentions are more apparent in industries like information and communications, professional services, as well as community, social and personal services. In fact, despite the challenges of various restrictions impacting business and consumer confidence, some sectors are growing and creating new jobs. Taking a leaf from the top 10 job vacancies in September 2020, the greatest demand were for cleaners (1,650), security guards (1,610), and software, web and multimedia developers (1,560) which may not be reflective of conditions today. But what is a useful takeaway is that these three jobs sit on two ends of the wage and skills spectrum - the former two likely arising due to shortages of foreign workers with border closures and the perceived reluctance of Singaporeans to do these jobs, while the hurdle to getting trained to become a developer is significantly higher. Its not inconceivable for the Singapore worker to upskill themselves. There have been success stories about many Singaporeans transiting to logistics, supply chain management, or even healthcare-related nursing or education fields, especially through professional conversion programmes, with a fair bit of gumption and open mindsets. The pandemic has brought about structural changes to the economy and the labour market must continue to adapt to new challenges post COVID-19. Singapores labour force is one of the most educated and skilled within the region. The eventual winding down of these temporary jobs should not be a long-termconcern as long as the Singapore economy remains competitive, investments continue to flow in and create jobs, and the workforce remains dynamic and productive. While there may be some angst over the bumpy process of exiting from pandemic challenges, there is light at the end of the tunnel. As part of the roadmap to open up the Singapore economy and live with an endemic coronavirus, borders will gradually open with a vaccinated travel lane with Germany and Brunei already planned from Sep 8. The return of overseas travellers could boost demand and usher in greater optimism for the beleaguered retail, food and beverage and hospitality sectors. More importantly, the unprecedented fiscal policy assistance given over the course of the last 18 months when the economic need aroseunderpins Singapores exceptionalism in a pandemic age. But the transformation to aid companies and workers who need help most to retool and retain work really started many years ago when milestone schemes like the Capability Development Grant and Workfare Income Supplement was introduced. With the current policy discussion now evolving to a more rapid ramping up of the Progressive Wage Model and contemplating potentially even a minimum wage model, the journey towards a more equitable and inclusive Singapore is coming into sharper focus. These efforts would signify a new normal and possibly an even more exciting new future for Singapore.Selena Ling is Head of Treasury Research and Strategy at OCBC Bank."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: NUS School of Design and Environment and Serie Architects/Rory Gardiner)SINGAPORE: The drive down Clementi Road might be peppered with greenery alongside several schools, but the National University of Singapores School of Design andEnvironment 4 (SDE4) is still a sight to behold.Standing six storeys tall at 8 Architecture Drive, the multidisciplinary space boasts a large oversailing roof, airy and open spaces, floor-to-ceiling glass panelsand concrete surfaces that resemble marble and its sleek facade is only enhanced by weaving in the surrounding mature trees into its design.But one thing stands out: Singapores first net-zero energy building to be built from scratch doesnt have a green facade. And this decision was intentional.Green facades are very popular now. This is a great idea, theres nothing wrong with it. But we realised our building is (already) surrounded by all this dense greenery. When you come to our campus, you'll see large trees and amazing flora. It felt like putting a green wall was just lip service to green sustainable thinking, explained Dr Nirmal Kishnani, associate professor at NUS SDE, toCNA.Not to mention, green walls still place a certain burden in terms of water consumption. Again, (green walls) have value, they provide cooling, they do a lot of things, but we evaluated the idea and decided it wasnt what we wanted to do for this particular site.Mr Giovanni Cossu, associate director of sustainability services at the Deans Office in NUS SDE, added that there was a lot of discussion on how to preserve the existing vegetation, primarily the trees, which are literally encapsulated in the structure.Such meaningful decisions are necessary in creating a net-zero building like SDE4, as these buildings are an absolute key to a sustainable future, said Dr Kishnani.Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, one of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan's key targets is to green 80 per cent of its buildings by 2030. Aside from NUS SDE4, some notable players in the market include Keppel Bay Tower, which isSingapores First Green Mark Platinum (Zero Energy) Commercial Building, and the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) zero-energy building.Yet, despite being known to be good for the environment, net-zero buildings are hardly springing up across the island.\"The basic premise of net-zero is when the building produces enough power by itself, and matches its consumption. It equalises the load that is consumed by the building.\"\"Zero means the building is at zero every day, every minute, every second. In the definition of how the industry looks at it, net-zero is assessed over a period of one year, where youre zero most of the time.\"After all, there are days or hours that you may end up producing more power than the building is consuming, and there are days when its on the opposite end. Therefore its net-zero over a 365-day period.\"\"In an off-grid building, you dont need to connect it to the grid. You put a bunch of batteries in it, and then whenever you are producing more than youre using, you store it in the battery.\"In net zero, you don't install the batteries for a reason. Singapores grid is better than a battery. So when we make extra (energy), were putting it into the grid; when we need some, were taking it from the grid. But it should net out to zero.\"Source: Mr Erwin Chong, Group Head of Corporate Real Estate Strategy and Administration at DBS, and Mr Prescott Gaylord, Head of Sustainability for Corporate Real Estate at DBS. For a start, many companies might not have an incentive to build net-zero buildings, because it isnt their primary business to be net-zero or focus on energy, suggested Mr Ang Kian Seng, group director of the environmental sustainability group at BCA.If you're in the business of healthcare, for example, your main priority is how you deliver healthcare to patients in a cost-effective manner. So energy is secondary, and therefore its never high up (on your priorities), he explained to CNA.But having said that, because of the climate emergency, like just this morning there was a flash flood, everything can be attributed to global warming. There is more extreme weather. People are beginning to realise we all need to do something.As a result, net-zero buildings can be part of the solution to fight climate change, added Mr Lei Zhang, founder and CEO of Envision Group and Envision Digital, whose company aims to addresssustainability challenges with technology solutions.Buildings in Singapore account for over 20 per cent of the countrys carbon emissions. Given the high emissions footprint of buildings, using design and technology to enable them to be net-zero can help mitigate climate change in a meaningful way, he told CNA.Mr Zhang also cited the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which he said suggested that globally, we will see more floods, changes in temperatures, more frequent rainfall.A third of Singapore, including its central business district, is less than 5m above mean sea level. Singaporeans have cause for concern, as it will literally be a situation of sink or swim if nothing is done, he added.One company that will soon walk the talk is DBS.Building on its commitment to achieve net-zero operational carbon emissions by 2022, the bank will transform an existing four-storey office building at 135 Bukit Timah Road into Singapores first net-zero development by a bank, DBS said in a press release in July.Modifying an existing building is known as retrofitting.We thought, what can be more green than not tearing down the building that we already have? We said, hey, lets truly challenge ourselves. Can we actually turn it into a net-zero building? shared Mr Erwin Chong, Group Head of Corporate Real Estate Strategy and Administration at DBS.(Theres) carbon that has already been used. Theres concrete, theres cost, theres everything that has already been built. (So that) set the ambition and the way we look at it. All of that fits with our responsible business practices and goals.Another principle guiding DBS in the process is that their building should blend in with the existing environment, much like the NUS SDE4 building.Were very near Botanic Gardens, a nice green patch of land in Singapore. The last thing we want is to create a building that looks like a concrete thing. We also wanted to make sure that we give back to the environment and the community, added Mr Chong.Speaking to CNA about BCA's zero-energy building that was built more than a decade ago by retrofitting a building within the BCA Academy, Mr Ang pointed to the concept of passive design.Its about harnessing the energy from the external environment to create a space thats conducive for the end-users. This is probably the first step that most buildings must take - deploy as many passive design strategies as possible, he said.One concept that we're trying to promote very aggressively is the use of natural ventilation, even in office space. We recognise that it's challenging, because now I think the acceptance of air conditioning is almost the (default) mindset.I think we need to do a lot of demonstration projects around what we call mixed mode ventilation, which means that you have a hybrid kind of system.Mr Ang also said BCA employs smart energy management, which is the opposite of a one size fits all approach in many offices, where a central system controls the lights and air-conditioning for the entire building.We wanted to give power to the individual, in terms of air-conditioning and lighting. For instance, they will (gauge) the right level of light for their own workspace; if other people are not using the space, then the light might not be so bright We need to make sure that the demand is met just right, so we don't waste energy unnecessarily, he said.But engineering and design challenges arent the only hurdles in adopting net-zero buildings.Its also about changing deep-rooted mindsets, whether its about embracing sustainability in our daily lives or accepting a lack of need for air-conditioning, said experts.My own opinion is that people are guarded by mindset. They (often) think of a traditional (type) of building, especially in a tropical climate like Singapore, with the air-con and all that. Its a big deciding factor as to why people don't adopt this (net-zero concept). Because its not traditional, or its not the general (way that things are done), said DBS Mr Chong.Concerns around cost and air-conditioning need to be addressed, added Mr Ang.One concern is the cost (of net-zero buildings). What is the incremental cost? There is a premium, but it will pay for itself, because the savings from running the operation will offset the upfront incremental costs.And where Singaporeans love for air-conditioning is concerned, changing their behaviour might take more than a little convincing.We started to have discussions around what indoor air comfort is, and its probably a function of three factors: The temperature you maintain within the space, the humidity and the airflow. When you talk about these three things together, I think peoples acceptance level (of using less air-con) becomes higher, said Mr Ang.They realise that with a bit of draft, you can do with a higher temperature. Its more comfortable that way. When the temperature is low, it might not be so good for the skin.Changing individual mindsets will mean that more companies make plans to build or retrofit their own net-zero buildings and DBS hopes theirs can eventually be a blueprint of sorts.Were not trying to just make this one net-zero building. This is part of an overall change in how we're looking at our space. We want to apply it to everything. Should all of our space be net-zero, we wanted to do it right, shared Mr Prescott Gaylord, Head of Sustainability for Corporate Real Estate at DBS.We wanted to use technologies, try things, such that it could be applied to our whole portfolio, and that it was accessible enough so that anyone else could copy us. We're not trying to hold on to any of our information. It will all be publicly available on the BCA website, if nothing else. We wanted to have a (greater) impact with our net-zero thinking.Mr Chong echoed his sentiments, hoping that big companies can think about net-zero beyond their premises and use their influence to encourage other companies to consider doing more.It is still important to go do your CSR (corporate social responsibility) activities, like cleaning the beach every now and then. But if its not part of your core business activities, where you can implement this at a(higher) level or (bigger) scale, then youre not doing your duty, since you are able to (have more) impact, he said.When I talk to Singaporeans about it, I think there is a great kind of camaraderie and civic understanding in doing your part. I think people in general understand that we have to take care of each other, added Mr Gaylord.Ultimately, experts agreed that the concept of net-zero buildings might be difficult to grasp if its seen as too technical for the layman. Instead, consider this: Net-zero is fundamentally about improving the individuals quality of life.Whenever NUS Dr Kishnani talks to people about zero energy, they assume its a cost-saving issue or a technology issue, but the SDE project has shown him that it makes for a much better quality of life, he said.The hybrid cooling system is not just saving us money; it's improving the health of our students and staff who use the building because it's 100 per cent fresh air, as compared to a conventional air conditioning system which is recirculated air. So we have less risk from spread of pathogens or build-up of carbon monoxide indoors, he shared.The zero-energy target is not something that stands on its own as a numerical target, and neither is it solely an engineering problem, he added.Its a different way of thinking about design. And if you think about it creatively, you bring to the table a lot of other benefits to the quality of our lives, and to our safety and our health Its a design problem, an everyday life problem.Dr Kishnani pointed out that it would help to reframe the issue of sustainability so that people dont see it as a sacrifice or ask what they must give up.If you think about sustainability in the right mindset, its a bonus to our lives. It creates pleasure, beauty and a higher quality of life. I think this is the thing that gets lost in the conversation, because there is a climate emergency so we're all reacting to that, and then there are issues of cost. They don't look at what value it brings to our lives, like how it changed the way we teach or how we experience the indoor environment, he said.We have to see (sustainability) not as an either/or situation, but as an and/also situation: If we do that, we get this as well."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: XM Studios, ADDX)SINGAPORE: XM Studios, a homegrown design studio specialising in handcrafted figurines of characters from popular media franchises such as Marvel and DC Comics, has raised S$4.5 million in fresh capital as it eyes an expansion into new markets and products.The funds were raised through a tokenised offeringon digital securities investment platform ADDX, according to a joint press release by XM Studios and ADDX on Thursday (Sep 9).Heliconia Capital Management, a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings, anchored the deal with a S$1 million investment. This comes a week after it was announced that Heliconia had entered into an agreement to become a new strategic investor of XM Studios.Apart from raising awareness of the company within the financial community, XM Studios decided to raise capital through digital securities as a way of rewarding its community of fans, co-founder and chief executive Ben Ang said.XM Studios has grown from a humble shop in Singapores Bras Basah Complex into a global brand. We could not have done this without the consistent support of our fans and collectors over the past decade.The fundraising on ADDX was designed to allow fractional access at a minimum investment of just S$10,000 because we wanted to provide long-time XM Studios fans with the chance to take part in the growth of the company, he said.Digital securities, also known as security tokens or tokenised securities, refer to financial securities such as stocks, bonds, fundsthat are issued and stored on a blockchain.By tapping on blockchain and smart contract technology, a digital securities exchangelike ADDX tokenises and fractionalises these securitiesinto multiple, smaller digital asset tokens.This lowers the investment threshold and expands access to a wider range of individual accredited investors, beyond just institutions or ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Issuers also get to benefit from a larger pool of potential investors.In the case of XM Studios offering, ADDX was able to reduce the minimum investment size to S$10,000, from the minimum of S$1 million that is typical for such investments, its press release said.The use of blockchain technology also automates certain manual processes, thus allowing lower issuance costs and a shorter lead time from the planning and structuring of a deal to the final issuance.Apart from ADDX, which was founded in 2017 and formerly known as iSTOX, Singapores largest lender DBS launched its own digital exchange for digital assets at the end of last year to provide tokenisation, trading and custody services to institutional and accredited investors.XM Studios offering was initially set at S$3 million but later upsized to S$4.5 million to accommodate high demand from investors during the subscription phase, said the joint press release.Apart from Heliconia, other international accredited investors, which were not named, took part on the same terms as the investment firm. The offering was 1.75 times over-subscribed based on XM Studios fundraising target.The offering took the form of exchangeable notes that are redeemable for shares in XM Studios at a significant discount under specific liquidity scenarios.If the exchangeable notes are not redeemed within 18 months, the notes will mature at an interest rate of 6 per cent per annum, the joint release said.Primary subscriptions have closed. XM Studios tokens are now listed on the ADDX secondary exchange, where they can be traded by all accredited investors including those who did not subscribe in the first instance.ADDXs chief commercial officer Choo Oi Yee described XM Studios as a superhero of a company. Even as it grows rapidly, the firm has succeeded in turning profitable, making it an attractive investment proposition, she added.The latest announcement adds another feather to the cap of XM Studios, which has come a long way since its humble origins as a collectible toy store in Bras Basah Complex.In 1997, Mr Ang and his brother Seng took S$1,000 money that was meant for polytechnic school fees to take over the collectible toy store, Xenomorph.But the road to success has not been easy and keeping the business afloat saw the two brothers diversifying into teaching painting, and making large-scale models for companies like Universal Studios Singapore.Mr Ang, in an interview with TODAY last November, recalled how his brother had consideredbecoming a taxi driver if their business failed. That was the impetus for him to think about a change in the business model and eventually jumping into the world of licensing.He began knocking on the doors of Warner Brothers and Disney. It took two years of setbacks and rejections before Disney finally called back in 2013, TODAY reported.Now, XM Studios holds several intellectual property licenses including those for Marvel, Star Wars, DC Comics, Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, Godzilla and Sanrio.Its name is well-recognised in the global collectible figurines industry as one of the top studios creating premium handcrafted figurines. Depending on complexity and size, these collectibles are priced from under S$1,000 to S$6,000.XM Studios now employs around 65 employees in Singapore and China, where itsquality-control facility is located.Fortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has not derailed growth. Last year, the company managed to more than double its revenue to S$16.9 million, while net profit came up to S$4.2 million.The rise in demand came as collectors were spending a lot more time at home admiring their collections, Mr Ang told CNA in an emailed interview. The inability to travel also meant extra savings for some.That said, the pandemic did cut off an important platform for XM Studios comic conventions, which it used to attend frequently with its distributors.So it quickly ramped up digital marketing efforts to ensure an online presence, and constantly engaged its community of fans through social media platforms like Facebook.Such moves were necessary given the rising tide of online shopping during the pandemic, Mr Ang said.Moving forward, XM Studios will look to expand its business in two new markets India and the Middle East and different product categories, such as the premium mass and lifestyle products.We want to nurture new collectors and expand the community, said Mr Ang, while noting that the premium mass collectibles will be priced at less than S$300 to reach out to young adults and casual collectors.These could be more fun and designer-range products to appeal to the masses, as well as the female demographic, he added.The fresh capital will also go to acquiring new intellectual property licenses and general working capital purposes.Meanwhile, XM Studios is set to open its flagship concept store at the end of the year, Mr Ang said.Located at Kitchener Complex, this 19,000 sq ft store will have a retail space, gallery, cafe and office all under one roof."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Traditionally a key pillar of the portfolios of individual investors in Singapore, the iEdge S-REIT Index, regarded as the S-REIT benchmark, reported a total return of 5.2 per cent since the start of 2020 to Nov 17. This was despite S-REITs raising new equity from unitholders, creating additional units and leading to potential dilution risk. In the past 23 months, S-REITs raised a total of S$8 billion through placements and rights issues led by mega-issuances from Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust and Frasers Logistics andCommercial Trust.Most S-REITs largely maintained their dividends, compensating for the fall in unit prices in this period. Global financial markets including S-REITs initially crashed when COVID-19 became a pandemic, with investors panicking and selling liquid financial assets. For investors daring and savvy enough to put money to work during the trough in end-March 2020, total returns from capital gains have been a whopping 57 per cent. Despite headlines on troubles in the retail space and how work-from-home has made offices redundant, occupancies measured by leases have remained high for S-REITs holding shopping malls and offices in Singapore, with little problems in rental collection, even if fewer are using these spaces. In the hardest hit hotel sector, the fall in physical property asset value was contained to less than 10 per cent at a portfolio level among the S-REITs tracked by OCBC, a good outcome despite the pandemic curbing travel.Hospitality REITs will likely need time to recover and could do better in a 24-month timeframe as borders reopen further. S-REITs today generate a significant volume of trading activity for the stock exchange - about one-fourth of the daily turnover before COVID-19. Primary equity markets in Singapore also skew towards S-REITs. S-REITs, at S$110 billion, represents 12 per cent of Singapores whole equity market by market cap a figure that is 6 per cent for Australia and only 2 per cent for Japan,the other two top REIT markets in the Asia-Pacific with large domestic economies. The top-performing Singapore stock in the past 23 months goes to iFAST Corporation, an investment products distribution platform, which generated total returns of 771 per cent during this time, superseding the Bloomberg Bitcoin Galaxy Index at 750 per cent. This is lower than the 1,131 per cent on the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index tracking cryptocurrencies. Still, S-REITs and the Singapore commercial property market continue to attract significant investor attention. Investors in Singapore are very familiar with the nuts and bolts of running a property, and understand how policies like stamp duties, urban planning, zoning, tenancy and ownership rules influence whether and when investors should buy an investment property and what to look out for in assessing a propertys attractiveness. Many like the idea of owning a passive, stable and recurring income stream. S-REITs generate fairly stable revenue, with the iEdge S-REIT Index reporting revenue per unit of S$132.5 in 2019.Though it dropped 6.3 per cent in 2020, analysts expect a rebound to S$135.6 this year.S-REITs are a good source of income. Qualifying S-REITs are encouraged to pay gains to unitholders instead of hoarding profits as they not taxed on dividends distributed to unitholders.The key challenge is share dilution when S-REITs need to raise to acquire new properties.Past transactions that have stirred market discussionsinclude K-REIT Asias (now known as Keppel REIT) 87.5 per cent interest in Ocean Financial Centre in 2011, Ascott Residence Trusts acquisition of Ascott Orchard Singapore, Citadines City Centre Frankfurt and Citadines Michel Hamburg in 2017 and Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trusts acquisition of Puri Mall in 2021. S-REITs are also regulated as a collective investment scheme under the Securities and Futures Act, where there is a 50 per cent cap on the leverage limit for S-REITs to keep credit risks in check. As listed entities, S-REITs also follow SGX rules on the disclosure of information and the right for minority investors to vote on major matters.Until S-REITs were launched in July 2002, the commercial property market was inaccessible to most individual retail investors, with ticket sizes of each standalone commercial property in the millions and billions of dollars.Today, all it takes is S$230 at last Wednesdays prices for an individual investor to buy into CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT), Singapores largest REIT, and enjoy a portion of CICTs rental income from shopping malls and offices. Few investment opportunities provide such stability for 4 to 7 per cent dividend yield per year. Its little wondersuch investment classes with a dividend income and the potential for capital gains appeal to investors with a neutral risk profile at Singapores median age of 42. Singapore has maintained an encouraging ecosystem for the development of S-REITs. Regulatory uncertainty is minimised as regulators routinely seek industry feedback from REIT managers, investors and lawyers before introducing new rules. The market has grown to include fund managers who invest in S-REITs as their specialty, REIT exchange traded funds and REIT derivatives. Bank lenders and bond investors in Singapore are highly familiar with S-REITs, together providing a pool of liquidity that allows the S-REIT market to grow bigger. Brokerages are also prepared to lend individual investors buying larger amounts of REIT units.The bigger question is whether we will continue to see capital gains in the coming 12 to 24 months as interest rates rise. In a world where stock market prices are affected by sentiments, Reddit fads and breaking news, S-REITscontinue to see strong investor demand because their valuation is backed by commercial properties where asset value has seen a continued upward trend.Indeed, S-REIT indices are not a good representation of the underlying economy. They are weighted towards larger S-REITs, rather than each S-REITs contribution to the Singapore economy. The iEdge S-REITs top five components make up 43.3 per cent of the index which have an outsized influence on total returns. Three are large-cap industrial REITs with industrial properties in Singapore and countries across Asia-Pacific, Europe and the United States in a world where logistics, data centres, business parks and manufacturing facilities have been resilient through the pandemic. The remaining two are large-cap commercial REITs owning quality assets with tenants largely staying put despite the economic downturn, with occupancies remaining above 90 per cent. Beyond the broad index, S-REITs that hold hotels and shopping malls located in the city centre have been dragged by the pandemic. With the city centre hollowed out as we work from home and international travelers non-existent, these S-REITs have underperformed Industrial REITs.Furthermore, the S-REIT industry has been kept buoyant by an inflow of capital. The broad money supply in Singapore has surged by 10.9 per cent year-on-year as of September. With interest rates on cash near-zero, all that money needs to go somewhere.The S-REITsmarket is unlikely to cool anytime soon. There is momentum. Thirteen out of the 80 IPOs with primary share offering in Singapore since 2016 were S-REITs raising S$5.6 billion collectively at an average offer size of S$430 million.Outside of S-REITs, a further S$2.7 billion was raised for two listings, Kakao Corp, the Internet company global depository receipt listing and NetLink NBN Trust, a business trust which holds infrastructure assets.The remaining 65 had an average offer size of S$28 million small cap listings with limited liquidity. Tellingly, the two upcoming IPOsin Singapore - Daiwa House Logistics Trust and Digital Core REIT - are both S-REITs. The equity analyst community is still optimistic and forecasting a rise in S-REIT dividends in the next 12 to 24 months. Driven by the growth and resiliency of industrial assets, particularly logistics warehouse and data centres, the Big Three industrial REITs of Ascendas Real Estate Investment Trust, Mapletree Logistics Trust and Mapletree Industrial Trust also recorded average total returns of 15.6 per cent in the past 23 months.Looking ahead, Singapore investors should not be so quick to dismiss the SGX, given the current slew of corporate restructuring exercises with the potential for capital gains, which may not be immediately apparent to new individual investors in the market. Many may be surprised that Sembcorp Industries generated a 85.5 per cent total return in the past 23 months, mainly led by capital gains after the spin-off of its loss-making subsidiary.Olam, generated a 31.2 per cent return over the past four months after an equity rights issue fuelled a share price fall, as plans to separately list its food and ingredients arm in London and Singapore becomes more certain.Singapore Telecommunications too, since announcing a strategic reset in end-May, saw a 3.9 per cent return in the past six months. For investors looking out for both dividends as well as growth in earnings, financial institutions stand out as a sector with growth in earnings expected in the next one to two years and are also dividend yielders. The three banks yielded average total returns of 22.3 per cent over 23 months from January to Nov 17, outperforming S-REITs. Buying S-REITs is likely to remain a cornerstone investment strategy for many individual investors. The more pertinent decision points remain how much S-REITs should feature as a percentage of ones investment portfolio and which specific ones to invest in.Still, until a next financial crisis with significant liquidity stress, we are unlikely to repeat the kind of capital gains seen from March 2020 to date in S-REITs. A lot of the negatives has since been priced in, with the broad iEdge S-REIT Index trading at 1.1 times the price-to-book value, indicating that the market cap of the S-REITs as a broad basket is now higher than the value of the underlying properties.

(Photo: StorHub Self Storage)SINGAPORE: Self-storage providersare seeing a boom in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with some already expanding their operations in Singapore.Enquiries and take-up rates for thesespaces, which people and businesses rent tostore personal items or inventory, have jumped, five providers told CNA.More people are realising they need additional space at home for remote working and for new hobbies, providers said.Demand is also rising from businesses rethinking office space needs or stocking up on goods to guard against supply chain disruptions.That said, demand did plummet during Singapore's \"circuit breaker\" last year. Lock+Store's chief executive Helen Ng said enquiries fell by 90 per cent between April andJune last year.But things picked upsoon after the country exited the lockdown. Enquiries from individuals have since risen by 30 per cent and by 20 per cent frombusinesses one-third of these individuals and half of these businesses eventually took up storage spaces, Ms Ng said.Lock+Store, which has 12 facilities across Singapore, has expanded its capacity at three popular locations.StorHub Self Storage, which was the first such operator here back in 2003, said its sales have grown more than 35 per cent since the start of 2020, along with a 110 per cent jump in enquiries. It opened two new locations this year, taking its number of facilities in Singapore to 13.COVID-19 has \"changed the rules of the game\", said the company's Singapore CEO Luigi La Tona.People used to see self-storage as a nice-to-have.Its now a need-to-have.Work+Store, which launched its 10th storage facility here in August, said take-up rates by individuals and businesses have increased by 10 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, when compared with pre-pandemic days.Over at Extra Space Asia, enquiries and take-up rates rose by about 30 to 40 per cent since early last year, with demand from businesses being slightly higher. The overall occupancy rate across its 11 locations now stands at 93 per cent, up from 87 per cent in 2019 before COVID-19 hit.The pandemic has not affected our business as storage is essential for many, be it for personal use or business use, although the reasons for needing storage have changed slightly, said chief executiveKenneth Worsdale.Self-storage spaces were already gaining popularity due to various factors such as scarcity of space in smaller homes, industry players said. But the shift to working from home has spurred more to seek out additional storage to put away bulky furniture and unused items like luggage.Being encouraged to work from home, people hope to recreate that ergonomic environment they had in their offices with a proper desk and chair, and that takes space. If thats the case, things that you may only need every once in a while will be going into storage, said Mr La Tona.People are also decluttering their homes to fit new pandemic hobbies cooking and baking equipment, bicycles, golf clubs and wine Mr La Tona said StorHub has seen a near200 per cent increase in demand for its wine storage facilities.There is alsosteady demand from home owners affected by delays in renovation works and completion of new housing projects.Some foreigners who visited their home countries and found themselves unable to return to Singapore due to changing border restrictions have also turned to self-storage spaces.Many have had to store their belongings with us either temporarily or for longer periods (like) more than sixmonths, said Lock+Store's Ms Ng.For business users, the demand stems from a combination of reasons such as companies having to resize to cope with pandemic-related uncertainties and the accelerated growth in e-commerce.For instance, the cycling boom has seen new bicycle shops spring up on e-commerce platforms. These businesses are renting spaces to store and assemble their bicycles, saidStore-Y, a self-storage operator set up by Far East Organizations Agape Business Group.Storage providers said businesses, especially new and smallenterprises, are attracted to their offerings of varying storage areas at low prices, flexible leases that can be as short as a month and 24/7 access. This is unlike warehouses that only offer a fixed space and longer leasing contracts.They may choose to upsize, downsize or even extend if they need to. Also, the ability to access their storage unit any time of the day is highly convenient for their business needs, said Extra Space Asia's Mr Worsdale.Global supply chain snarls have also prompted many businesses to stock up well ahead of the year-end festive season. They have similarly turned to self-storage providers due to flexible, short-term leases, Work+Store CEO DannyWong said.Also requiring storage options are businesses that have had to downsize or close amid the pandemic.These storers are often unable to dispose their assets and do not want to throw them away in the hope that they may be able to begin business again once there is more certainty in the economic future, Mr Worsdale said.Amid optimism about the industry's outlook, self-storage operators have either embarked on or are mulling further expansion plans in Singapore.StorHub opened two facilities this year in Kallang and Yishun, and will open another two inSerangoon and Toh Guan in the first quarter of next year.Taken together, its going to be close to 300,000 sqft of space that we will have opened in just a year, said Mr La Tona.Why? Because the demand is there and the demand continues to increase.Brisk business in the self-storage industry will add to demand for industrial properties, which has been generally resilient amid the pandemic, said Ms Alice Tan, head of consultancy at Knight Frank Singapore.With the robust demand, industrial space in choice locations near residential areas or with convenient transport options has fallen. But there arestill industrial properties with under-utilised space, which can be used for self-storage facilities, she said.Operators are also getting creative to stay ahead of the competition.Work+Stores newest outlet in Kallang Bahru offers additional facilities like photography and live-streaming studios, a pantry, a packing area, as well as a pick-up and return centre. The subsidiary of LHN Group also recently teamed up with logistics firm J&T Express to offer its storage users last-mile delivery services.We created these based on observations of our users and their requirements, said CEO MrWong. Many of its business users are micro-SMEs that usestorage units for packing and inventory checks, he added.We noticed that they often spend three to four hours in their units so we also decided to provide a pantry area which can double up as meeting spaces with suppliers, he added.At Extra Space Asia, those who signup for its executive storage plan can get access to a round-the-clock co-working space. These are usually entrepreneurs and small business owners who need office space along with access to their inventory, the firm said.StorHub also said it has a new lifestyle concept, which it described as a higher-end offering with digital locks, premium security and communal areas. This is currently only available at its Toa Payoh facility.With digitalisation a priority amid the pandemic, other new initiatives in the works by various self-storage operators include offering virtual tours and smartphone apps for users.Knight Frank, in a report dated May 2020, had urged self-storage operators to leverage technology to differentiate themselves.For example, they can analyse data from bookingsor tap facial recognition software to heighten surveillance and the security of storage facilities, Ms Tan told CNA.So far, the industrys technological offerings have remained fairly fundamental, likely due to cost considerations. Local users are also not demanding, she added.But who knows, maybe a self-storage player can set the trend of using facial recognition as user authentication and the industry will pivot as a whole, which (will then be seamless) with Singapores overall digital infrastructure strategy, said Ms Tan."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Mr Cheng,head ofreal estate developer GuocoLand, noted thenthat the BTR model was becoming more prevalent in other citiesand was attractive toyounger people, families and retirees.The idea was raised again in November by MP Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang) as part of a broader pitch for more diverse housing options. He urged authorities to increase the stock of public rental housing across all flat sizes, and mooted apublic-private BTR collaboration asone way to develop this supply.Generally, BTR projects differ from service apartments or co-living apartments as they are meant for longer-term stays.They are also professionally managed, often with handymen service, housekeeping or community engagement programmes, said Mr Cheng in March.More importantly, these rental units would be usefuleven in a country with extremely high home ownership ratesto cater to changing aspirations and needs, said real estate analysts.Ms Tang Wei Leng, managing director of Colliers Singapore, said that given Singapore's success with home ownership rates at about 90 per cent, it is timely to provide an alternative housing option for different users not just younger Singaporeans, but different age profiles.A lot of things have transformed and evolved over COVID, so much so that one keyword that has come up very often is flexibility. Rent offers a lot more flexibility versus purchase.It would also cater to the growing desire for mobility, she said. For instance, those hoping to work overseas may not want to plunge into buying a home and instead prefer to rent.Mr Alan Cheong, Savills Singapores executive director of research and consultancy, echoed that the pandemic has magnified, accentuated and accelerated the need for a BTR concept.Demand for rental units has grown, amid the work-from-home phenomenon which has drivenyounger workers to crave more space of their own, he said. Their rising incomes have also allowedthem to act on this desire.Lifestyles are also changing, with more people delaying marriage or choosing to remain single, Mr Cheong said. More are also marrying foreigners and may want to buy a home in their spouse's country and rent one in Singapore.Ms Alice Tan, head of consultancy at Knight Frank Singapore, added that the idea of injecting new home supply with more rental units also comes against a backdrop of rising property prices.The renting model could also promote a spirit of entrepreneurship\"among those who wantto invest in business instead of property. Diverse accommodation choices also make living and doing business in Singapore more attractive, she said.A BTR model would also support an ageing populationas seniors and empty nesters choose todownsize their properties, said Colliers' Ms Tang.If you don't like it, theres (Sellers Stamp Duty) to consider and you got to suck it up and live in it for the next few years before you can move. However, if you rent, you can experiment. You can consider: Does it suit you?She added that having a single landlord may offer more security and comfort to older folks. One could also meet like-minded people in the developmentor those from different walks of life, with the chance of building new friendships, she said.Ms Tangdescribed the BTR model as a very scalable propositionin light of the current demand in the market.It offers different business possibilities, and it offers developers the potential of stable long-term income, asset management opportunities which could eventually be spun into a real estate investment trust (REIT).Knight Franks Ms Tan said there is indeed growing interest in new rental formats, including co-living, as construction delays squeeze home supply.But while developers are keeping tabs on the trend, she does not see many exploring this as thetraditional build-to-sell model is still generally profitable in Singapore.The high upfront costsof land development in Singapore including land, construction and stamp duties means that the BTR model may not be viable. The payback period under thismodel is also much longer, she said.The business case of the BTR model must be proven in terms of longevity and sustainability from end-user demand and costs perspectives, before more private developers will undertake this in a big way.Savills Mr Cheong agreed that not all developers would be keen, with hotel or hospitality companies and private equity firms more likely to show interest.But NMP Mr Cheng said the model is an asset class sought after by many global institutional investors, and private global capital is ready to be tapped in this instance.While overseas BTR projects are often private ventures, there is scope for private-public collaboration too.In March, Mr Cheng called on authorities to review some areas to encourage active and responsible participation by the private sector, including in land supply, development,and creating an eco-system of developers and service providers.On what such partnerships could look like, Knight Franks Ms Tan suggested a cost-profit sharing model.Private sector expertise could add value to BTR projects in design creativity and best practices in management. The public sector could pilot some projectsby putting government land sale plots up for tender with a BTR requirement, she said.Workers' Party MPMr Chua cited a similar example in Queensland, Australia, where authorities are working with private developers on affordable rental housing. They have approved two BTR projects including one by Singapore-listed developer Frasers Property.Mr Chua also earlier said thatgiven the resilience of Singapore's residential housing market compared to retail and commercial properties during the pandemic, he was confident there wouldbe no lack of interest by private developers to partner with the Housing Board in coming up with such models.But if HDB does decide to embark on a BTR model, there would also have to be the associated safeguards and policy changes to take effect alongside it, he told CNA over email.\"At present, not only are commercial market rentals expensive ... they do not offer much certainty to lessees both in terms of tenure, rent and other form of protections asthese are typically for a lease tenure of one to twoyears and with no certainty on renewaland no certainty on rental rates upon renewal. So this would have to be looked into first.\"Colliers Ms Tang also said criteria on who is allowed to rent public flats may also have to be refined.Following Mr Chuas motion in November, Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Annsaid home ownership has been and will continue to be\"the key strategy in Singapores public housing policy.Thoughauthorities will keep studying changing preferences and developing policies to meet these,mainstream rental represents a significant departure from our public housing policy and principles, said Ms Sim.It will reshape our social norms and could weaken our communities, because unlike home ownership where people sink their roots, rentals are more transitory. This is not something we will embark on lightly, without deep consideration.In the meantime, authorities will continue to prioritise our resources to support Singaporeans in achieving their home ownership aspirations that is, homes owned by Singaporeans, and not by private investors through REITs.Another issue, noted Savills Mr Cheong, is that having such a new housing model may have social impacts that are hard to predict.If you have BTR, you may also be encouraging people not to get married, you could keep the camp in that direction. Population size and birth rates may fall.Thats where the danger is its hard to think of the ramifications (which) are going to spawn out into the unknown.There are also legacy ideas to overcome, he said, pointing to deep-rooted cultural ideas linking home ownership and status.Knight Franks Ms Tan also noted that Asians view home ownership as a long-term investment asset and a symbol of success in ones life phase.Ultimately, Mr Chua pointed out that it does not have to be an either or model of home ownership versus rental, and we should not automatically assume one model is superior compared to the other.For Singaporeans, everyones circumstances change all the time, and we should cater to Singaporeans housing needs across life stages, as people may decide it is most appropriate to rent or buy at different stages of their lives.Colliers Ms Tang agreed, sayingrespect should be accorded to the different reasons andaspirations behind both options.She added that there isnt a need for us to be deliberate\" about changing people's attitudes towardsthe value of renting versus home ownership.It'salready there and it will continue to evolve with the different changes, changing trends, the habits and behaviour that we're seeing."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Photos and video: Suzhou Industrial ParkA joint venture between the governments of China and Singapore, Suzhou Industrial Park has over the last two decades honed its reputation as a modern, open development zone and a model of international cooperation.Once a low-lying field at the outskirt of Suzhou, the completed park was the culmination of top-level design that was intended to drive innovation and reform in China. Spanning 278 sq km, the park houses a China-Singapore cooperation area and is home to 1.13 million residents. The China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development the master developer and cooperation carrier for the park was successfully listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2019.Today, Suzhou Industrial Park is known for its high degree of openness one that is prime for fostering innovation. In the next stage of its evolution, the park is poised to be a hub for emerging industries such as biomedicine, nanotechnology applications and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as for high-end equipment manufacturing and modern services.Central to its development moving forward is the One Zone and Two Centers concept that sees the establishment of the National Biotechnology Innovation Centre, the National Third-generation Semiconductor Technology Innovation Centre and the National Pilot for Innovation and Development of New Generation Artificial Intelligence.IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCEDespite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Suzhou Industrial Park still managed to reach new milestones, with the total output value of its industries exceeding 500 billion yuan (S$105.437 billion) in 2020. The output value of high-tech enterprises accounted for 72.4 per cent of the total large-scale industrial output, while high-tech industries such as biomedicine, nanotechnology applications and AI accounted for 63.5 per cent in 2020.This year, the number of high-tech enterprises at Suzhou Industrial Park will reach 2,000 giving the park a firm foundation from which it can reach new heights in innovation. For starters, the Suzhou biomedicine industry is already at the forefront of innovation capabilities and quality development in China. In addition, half of the top 10 semiconductor microelectromechanical systems companies in China maintain a presence in the park, which has also been hailed as one of the eight most representative regions in the world for micro-nano manufacturing.Within China, Jiangsu province the home of Suzhou Industrial Park ranks second highest in its furthering of the digital economy, which exceeded four trillion yuan and accounted for over 40 per cent of the provinces gross domestic product. The growth of the digital economy has been further accelerated by the pandemic, and has transformed traditional industries and improved service capabilities in the province.Mr Shen Mi, member of the Standing Committee of Suzhou Municipal Committee and party secretary of CPC Suzhou Industrial Park Working Committee, said: To accelerate the construction of a world-class high-tech zone, we must focus on innovation and technological self-reliance, benchmark ourselves to advanced zones both domestically and internationally, and create an open and cooperative highland powered by technological, industrial and international institutional innovation.THE SINGAPORE CONNECTIONJiangsu has long had close economic and trade ties with Singapore. Last year, the total import and export volume of goods traded between Jiangsu and Singapore stood at US$14.27 billion (S$19.364 billion) a 6.1 per cent year-on-year increase, accounting for 16 per cent of the total trade of goods between China and Singapore.To date, Singapore has accumulated close to 3,700 investment projects in Jiangsu and has invested US$26.66 billion. In turn, Jiangsu has invested in 290 Singapore projects, with a contractual investment amount of US$3.46 billion.Mr Hui Jianlin, member of the Standing Committee of Jiangsu Provincial Committee, said: We will implement the consensus reached by the leaders of China and Singapore to further strengthen cooperation amid the pandemic, deepen the joint construction of the Belt and Road initiative and the construction of new land-sea corridors, as well as reach a new level of cooperation in digital economy advancement.In his speech, Mr Hui also noted that China has formally applied to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, which Singapore is a partner of: This reflects Chinas clear stance and firm determination to participate actively in international cooperation in the digital economy, match international high-level rules and standards, and continue opening up.Ms Liu Hua, vice chairman of Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee, expressed her desire for Suzhou Industrial Park to continue to deepen China-Singapore cooperation with the establishment of the Singapore International Business Cooperation Centre, which was unveiled in February 2021.Located at one-north, the centre is intended to be an outpost for China-Singapore two-way investment, and to provide a raft of professional services such as business consultation, incubator cultivation, market development and financing for China-Singapore enterprises. Wholly owned by Jurong Town Corporation and operated by CSSD International Business Cooperation Centre, its development of pro-business strategies is guided by Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee.A LONG COOPERATION GROWS CLOSERSuzhou Industrial Park has long adapted learnings from Singapore to fit Suzhous needs while continually seeking to refine its practices in order to stay competitive. According to global consultants KPMG, Suzhou Industrial Park has risen to 25th position globally in a ranking of business environments, with enterprises found to be most satisfied with the parks legal environment, property protection and policies.Said Mr Shen: The park has always been part of the overall cooperation and effort between China and Singapore to jointly explore third-party markets, create an internationalised corridor and build two-way open platforms in the form of Singapore Suzhou Business Centre and Suzhou Singapore Centre. All of this works to deepen the practical cooperation between China and Singapore in the fields of cross-border investment, service trade, financial and technological innovation, and digital government construction.Looking ahead to the 30th anniversary of Suzhou Industrial Park in 2024, the local Suzhou government plans to establish a first-class pilot free trade zone that aims to emulate Singapores experience as a free trade port.Mr Shen added: Suzhou Industrial Park will quicken its pace to build a world-class high-tech park andpilot free trade zone, and a new future-oriented centre of Suzhou.Learn more about Suzhou Industrial Park."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Photos: ShutterstockExisting interest rate benchmarks the Singapore Dollar Swap Offer Rate (SOR) and the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) are being phased out over the next two to three years. In tandem, banks here are shifting to the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA), which will become the main interest rate benchmark for Singapore dollar loans going forward. This change will see all SOR-based loans converted to alternative packages ahead of SORs discontinuation after Jun 30, 2023. Loans based on SIBOR will also be converted, though at a later stage, as the widely used one-month and three-month SIBOR will only be discontinued after Dec 31, 2024. Issuance of new SORA-based loans is on the rise. As of Apr 30, 2021, a total of S$4.2 billion worth of SORA-based retail and corporate loans have been issued by domestic systemically important banks in Singapore.Mrs Ong-Ang Ai Boon, director of The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), answers some important questions that businesses may have regarding the shift to SORA.1. WHY DO I HAVE TO SWITCH OUT OF MY SOR- OR SIBOR-BASED COMMERCIAL PROPERTY LOAN? The move away from SOR and SIBOR is in line with global interest rate benchmark reform efforts to improve the robustness and integrity of financial benchmarks. SOR will be discontinued as its computation relies on the US Dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (USD LIBOR), which international regulators have decided to discontinue after Jun 30, 2023. SOR will therefore be discontinued after the same date.SIBOR is also being phased out in line with other interbank offered rates across the world. The six-month SIBOR will be discontinued after Mar 31, 2022, while the one-month and three-month SIBOR will be discontinued after Dec 31, 2024. For borrowers on SOR- or SIBOR-based property loan packages, your bank will no longer compute the interest payments based on SOR or SIBOR after they are discontinued. You will therefore need to switch to an alternative loan package, such as one based on SORA. 2. HOW IS SORA DIFFERENT FROM SOR AND SIBOR?SOR and SIBOR reflect the cost of borrowing Singapore dollars over periods such as a month, three months or six months. SOR is the effective rate of borrowing Singapore dollars by first borrowing US dollars and then swapping these for Singapore dollars, while SIBOR measures directly the cost of borrowing Singapore dollars on an uncollateralised basis. Both SOR and SIBOR are published by the ABS Benchmarks Administration Co (ABS Co).In contrast, SORA reflects the cost of borrowing Singapore dollars on an overnight basis. SORA tends to be lower than SOR and SIBOR because overnight lending rates being free of term and credit risk premiums that are present when lending to counterparties over longer periods tend to be lower than term lending rates. SORA has been published daily by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) since 2005. It is a transparent, robust and reliable measure of market interest rates as it is based on a large volume of actual transactions taking place in overnight interbank lending markets each day.3. WHY DID THE LOAN SPREAD CHANGE WHEN I CONVERT MY SOR- OR SIBOR-BASED LOAN TO SORA-BASED LOAN?The overall interest rate for a floating rate loan is made up of the reference rate (i.e. SOR, SIBOR or SORA) and the loan spread. In the conversion of a SOR- or SIBOR-based loan to a SORA-based loan, the loan spread may be adjusted to account for differences in term and credit risk premiums between SOR/SIBOR and SORA. You should discuss with your bank how the loan spreads and overall interest rates differ across the options.4. HOW ARE INTEREST PAYMENTS DETERMINED IN SORA-BASED LOANS?Borrowers today are familiar with the use of SOR or SIBOR interest rates where, for instance, interest payments due at the end of each interest period (one, three or six months) of the property loan are typically based on the SOR or SIBOR rate at the start of that period. In comparison, there are two different approaches to the use of SORA in loans. For loans used by large businesses, interest payments due at the end of each interest period would tend to be based on the average of daily SORA rates within that interest period. This means that interest amounts due can only be known towards the end of the interest period, giving borrowers less time to prepare for their payments. However, this is fine as large corporations are likely to have resources and systems dedicated to managing finances. Most retail customers and smaller businesses may require advance notice on payments due. Banks will typically also offer SORA loan packages where interest payments due at the end of each interest period are based on compounded-in-advance SORA rates. Compounded-in-advance SORA is the average of the daily SORA rates from a prior interest period and it allows for the interest payments to be determined at the start of an interest period, similar to SOR and SIBOR loans. Regardless of the approach, the averaging effect of the compounded SORA rates helps to smooth out interest rate fluctuations. Interest payments for SOR and SIBOR loans rely on a single days reading on the date when the interest rate resets, making them more exposed to idiosyncratic market factors on that particular day.5. HOW DO I SWITCH OUT OF MY SOR- OR SIBOR-BASED LOAN?For SOR loan holders, you should contact your bank as soon as possible to explore options to switch to an alternative loan package that meets your business needs. If you have a loan that references six-month SIBOR, you should contact your bank immediately as the six-month SIBOR will be discontinued after Mar 31, 2022.If you have a loan that references one-month or three-month SIBOR, your bank will contact you in due course to guide you in replacing your SIBOR loan with other loan packages. In the meantime, if you are looking to refinance your existing SIBOR loan, you can consider the available bank loan packages, including SORA-based loans as well as other alternatives, such as fixed-rate loans, and loans linked to board rates or deposit rates. 6. WILL MY TOTAL DEBT SERVICING RATIO NEED TO BE REASSESSED? Total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) is only applicable to individuals, sole proprietors and shell companies with property loans. As part of the industry-wide exercise to facilitate a smooth transition from SOR to SORA, MAS will not require TDSR to be re-computed for affected borrowers making the switch within the same bank. If you initiate a refinancing of your investment commercial property loan or property loan with another bank (which will be subject to that bank's terms and conditions), you should check if you can avail yourself of other TDSR exemptions.

Photos: SGInnovateEmerging technologies have the potential to solve many of the biggest challenges facing Asia Pacific today, but closer collaboration among stakeholders is urgently needed to advance these scientific innovations quickly and responsibly. This was a common thread raised by industry leaders at this year's Deep Tech Summit, organisedby SGInnovate in conjunction with the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology. Held from Nov 8 to Nov 10, the hybrid event convened over 100 speakers and partners, and more than 2,500 attendees comprising a global community of deep tech start-ups, investors, corporate innovators, researchers, government partners and international organisations. Conversations centred around four key areas agri-food, health and biomedical sciences, advanced manufacturing, and sustainability identified as strategic sectors for Singapore.Our work is guided by our mission to build a thriving, entrenched deep tech economy and it has been our privilege to be able to explore the next chapter of emerging technology adoption with many of the world's leading deep tech innovators and champions, said Dr Lim Jui, chief executive officer, SGInnovate. The application of these discussions and perspectives will shape our approach to developing talent and helping start-ups scale, as deep tech becomes a new area of growth with solutions for the world's most pressing challenges, he added.DEEP TECH AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCESA highlight of the Deep Tech Summit was the Memorandum of Understanding between SingHealth and SGInnovate. The partnership is expected to enable SingHealth and SGInnovate to scale Singapore's healthcare capabilities by leveraging deep tech, focusing on investing in artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics to strengthen infrastructure and expand capacity.These heightened capabilities are expected to boost the resilience of Singapore's healthcare system, while mitigating existing challenges such as the talent crunch, an ageing population and the growing prevalence of chronic diseases.Panellists who spoke at the health and biomedical sciences track that was co-curated with SingHealth shed light on the rising complexity of the healthcare sector. Beyond continued investment in advanced technologies, they noted the need to nurture a pool of diverse, multidisciplinary talent armed with entrepreneurial skills and business acumen.\"Successful leaders in the health and MedTech space need to have a holistic understanding of the entire innovation cycle,\" said Dr Mary Kan, programme director at Singapore Biodesign, A*STAR, who spoke at the session 'Shaping Tomorrow's Leaders in Biomedical Innovation'. \"This is particularly pertinent in healthcare because of its multi-faceted and complex nature, which means risks can surface from multiple sources.\"Dr Kan added that the ability of these leaders to strategise around areas such as regulation, reimbursement, clinical studies and intellectual property would lead to a higher chance of success especially as MedTech continues to evolve to focus on delivering value-based innovations.BUILDING A DEEP TECH ARSENAL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGEThe role of technology in mitigating the impact of climate change was brought to the fore at Deep Tech Summit.Speakers echoed many of the issues highlighted at the recent COP26 summit, where conversations revolved around how collective action must steer the planet on the right track towards a sustainable future without delay.Singapore has also committed resources to improve sustainability initiatives through its Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 (RIE2025) plan. However, while there is growing recognition of the need for science and innovation to lead the sustainability charge, panellists noted that technology alone is not the answer.Speaking at the 'Towards a Low-carbon Future' panel, Dr Peter Nagler, executive director and chief innovation officer, A*STAR, highlighted the need for society to shift our economy to one that emphasises circularity and maximises the use of our limited resources.Other experts raised the issue of unequal levels of expertise and understanding of the issues across various stakeholders. Mr Ozzeir Khan, director of digital innovation and architecture, Asian Development Bank, noted the need for stakeholders to be on the same page to amplify efforts.Bridging that knowledge gap between funding institutions and the latest ideas by innovators in the field will enable us to move together faster to promote sustainable development, he said.TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD FEED THE WORLDClosely intertwined with the issue of sustainability is that of food security. Several experts at the event brought up the importance of deep tech start-ups often drivers of cutting-edge research in agri-food production as crucial stakeholders in the food industrys efforts to scale production sustainably.This is especially relevant in Singapore, where emerging technologies, such as cell-cultured meats and alternative proteins, alongside robotics and vertical farming, have been identified as critical components in meeting goals such as the nation's 30 by 30 targets to produce 30 per cent of nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030.As a start-up, we fit in the ecosystem as innovators. We spark the innovation and create the technology, but we need corporate partners to help us scale up production and bring products to market, shared Dr Sandhya Sriram, group chief executive officer and co-founder of Shiok Meats, a cultivated meat and seafood company, who also stressed the need for stakeholders to support one another, to achieve these objectives in time.GROWING INDUSTRY 4.0 IN SINGAPOREIn order to ensure that the manufacturing sector one of Singapores economic pillars continues to make up a fifth of the countrys output, ambitious targets have been set to grow the manufacturing industry by 50 per cent over the next 10 years. A greater proportion of output is set to come from advanced manufacturing, where competition is driven by higher-value factors such as intellectual property, quality and precision.To achieve these targets, Singapore has set its sights on fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies to power the sector. The impact of these technologies was also further explored in a corporate roundtable with advanced manufacturing experts from across the public and private sectors. However, panellists at the summit noted that technology adoption in the region has been slower than desired.Mr Ng Tian Chong, managing director for Greater Asia at HP Inc, who spoke at a session titled Next Ten Years of Industry 4.0, alongside panellists from the World Economic Forum, Singapore Hitachi Energy and TUV SUD, emphasised that the advancement of 4IR will require businesses to take a people-first approach to technology modernisation.Mr Ng said: As we speak with manufacturers, we stress that 4IR adoption is a gradual process that is about much more than just technology, but one that centres around workforce transformation.Roles of the future will involve augmented responsibilities and working in tandem with new technologies, he added, further noting that programmes at HP are focused on ensuring employees are supported through digital upskilling initiatives, to make certain the team is able to stay ahead of industry trends and developments.DEEP TECH FOR GOODMomentum in the deep tech space in Singapore has grown over the years, catalysed by an increasing number of investors, corporations and public sector bodies.Wrapping up the three-day summit, experts iterated the importance of making sure that scientific developments benefit society at large, against a backdrop of burgeoning investment and interest in the deep tech sector.Ensuring that technology development is responsible and ethical is not something we can leave up to chance, shared Ms SzeKi Sim, executive director of brand and community at SGInnovate. Deep techs role in tackling global issues has to be underscored by stakeholders in the ecosystem who work together to ensure that these innovations do not widen existing inequalities, and continue to create both economic and social impact.Learn more about collaboration and partnership in the Deep Tech community and discover opportunities for Open Innovation.

From Thursday, the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) rates for those purchasing additional properties will be raised.The total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) for borrowers will also be tightened, while the Loan-to-Value (LTV) limits for loans from HDB will be lowered.Authorities also pledged to raise the supply of private and public housing, adding that further details will be announced on Thursday.In its press release, HDB noted that it has increased the supply of new flats in recent years launching around 14,600 BTO flats in 2019 to about 17,100 this year.The planned launches of up 23,000 new flats a year in 2022 and 2023 mark a 35 per cent increase from 2021s figure.Demand for public housing has increased significantly in recent years, with the overall number of applications received per BTO flat up from 3.7 times in 2019 to 5.5 times in 2021, it added.This is due to more marriages as the larger cohorts of those born in the late 1980s to 1990s reach marriageable age, as well as the growing trend of smaller households. COVID-related factors and the buoyant resale market have also spurred demand for BTO flats, the agency said.HDB stressed that it will continue to monitor the housing needs of Singaporeans, taking into account long-term demographic and population trends.We are also watching the construction progress of current BTO projects closely to ensure that they can be delivered on time. We will continue to develop new housing areas in the future and ensure that public housing remains affordable and accessible for Singaporeans, it said.Separately, the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme for the first half of 2022 was announced, comprising five confirmed list sites and eight reserve list sites.These sites can yield about 6,500 private residential units, 90,000 sq m of gross floor area (GFA) of commercial space and 530 hotel rooms, said the Ministry of National Development (MND).Planned and announced every six months, GLS programmes release state land for private development.Land on the confirmed list is launched for sale at pre-determined dates, with most land parcels sold through tenders.Land on the reserve list, meanwhile, is not released for tender immediately but is made available for application. A reserve list site is put up for tender when a developer indicates a minimum price which is accepted by the government.This time round, the confirmed list comprises five private residential sites, including an executive condominium (EC) site at Bukit Batok West Avenue 5. Together, they can yield about 2,785 private residential units, including 495 EC units.The reserve list is made up of five private residential sites, including an EC site at Tampines Street 62, two white sites in Kampong Bugis and Woodlands Avenue 2, and one hotel site. These sites can yield an additional 3,715 private residential units including 700 EC units, 90,000 sqm GFA of commercial space and 530 hotel rooms.On the buoyant private housing market, MND noted that transaction volumes and prices have been on the rise over the past year despite the COVID-19 pandemics economic impact.Meanwhile, the inventory of unsold private housing units has also declined.To ensure that there is sufficient supply of private housing to meet demand and ensure market stability, the Government has decided to increase the supply of private housing on the confirmed list to 2,785 units for the 1H2022 GLS programme, said the ministry, noting that there were 2,000 units under the GLS programme from the second half of this year.MND added that it is prepared to step up supply further if demand remains strong.At the same time, the additional supply on the reserve list will give developers a good selection of sites to initiate for development if they assess that there is demand, it said.The Government will continue to monitor economic and property market conditions closely and adjust the supply of future GLS programmes, as necessary."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

But existing property owners who spoke to CNA are split on what the change means.All non-owner occupied residential properties will see higher taxes, with the increase being more significant for properties at the high end, according to Budget 2022 announcements. (Photo: iStock/Joesboy)SINGAPORE: If you own a penthouse or Good Class Bungalow for investment purposes,you may feel the pinch from the upcoming increase in property tax.However, if your property commands an annual value of S$30,000 or less like most homes the tax hike may not have a significant impact.As the increase targets the ultra-rich, it is a wealth tax rather than a cooling measure, making it a progressive tax scheme, property analysts told CNA.Finance Minister Lawrence Wong announced in his Budget 2022 speech thatalong with a higher personal income tax rate for top-tier earners and an additional levy on luxury cars,property taxes will be raised.The increase will apply to homes with annual values of more than S$30,000and all non-owner occupied properties, with the rise being more significant for high-end homes.Currently at 10 to 20 per cent, the tax rates for non-owner occupied propertieswill first be raised to between 11 and27 per cent in 2023, before being raised further to between 12 and36 per cent in 2024.These hikes would see a slightly greater increase in property tax on higher-end assets with annual value exceeding S$30,000, but would only skew towards posing a significant impact when we transit into the luxury categories of penthouses and Good Class Bungalows, said Mr Evan Chung, head of Knight Frank Property Network.Hence achieving its goals of being a progressive tax scheme.The annual value of Good Class Bungalows typically are in excess of S$100,000 and would bear the brunt of the increase, he added.The hike is regarded more as a wealth tax\", and its targeted at the top end of the market, added Ms Tricia Song, head of research for Southeast Asia at CBRE Singapore.For example, the maximum 80 per cent hike of S$9,600 for a S$90,000 annual value investment property can chip away about 8 per cent of its gross annual rental income, she explained.This is still minimal, considering a property worth S$5 million ...Out of the nearly 33,000 private home sales, including resales in 2021, only 1,539 units or 4.7 per cent were over S$5 million in value, she said.The bulk of the transactions were below S$2 million, meaning they would only attract 20 per cent more property tax, or less than 2 per cent of gross rental income.But Mr Chung highlighted that the bulk of these luxury assets cater for owner-occupation, thus incurring a milder increase in taxation rates.For owner-occupied homes, the taxrate currently ranges from 4 to 16 per cent beyond the first S$8,000 of a propertys annual value. Under the new changes, there will be a taxation range of 5 to 23 per cent beyond the first S$30,000 valuation by 2023, with a further increase to between 6 and32 per cent in 2024.The ultra-rich would unlikely be deterred in acquiring a trophy asset given greater financial resources at their disposal, said Mr Chung.The tax hike is also unlikely to affect the selling of luxury homes as such properties tend to be more focused on capital appreciation than just rental yield, added country manager for PropertyGuru Singapore, Dr Tan Tee Khoon.Demand for luxury residential properties has been resilient, largely driven by both local and foreign property buyers. Furthermore, the focus on capital preservation throughout the pandemic has driven many foreign investors to divert their funds to real estate properties, he said.Luxury home sales in Singapore have risen to their highest in more than 10 years, he noted.According to Urban Redevelopment Authoritydata, private home sales in the Core Central Region jumped by almost 25 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of 2021 to 1,930 units. This made it the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2010.Additionally, in the first half of 2021, almost 3,500 luxury homes were sold, surpassing the annual sales from 2018 to 2020.Luxury homes are residences typically found in the Core Central Region with a price point of S$2 million and above, at an average of S$2,500 per square foot.Outside of luxury homes, the property tax increase could affect average investorsbut it wont be a dealbreaker, said analysts.After all, the median annual value of non-landed private homes, excluding executive condominiums, was a modest S$22,000 in 2020 a category that most investment properties in Singapore fall under, said Knight Franks Mr Chung.The magnitude of increase for non-owner occupied property tax is fairly moderate, given it would be only an increase of S$220 for each year of 2023 and 2024 from the original S$2,200 in 2022.Moreover, compared to the high cost of purchase with the recent hike in Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD), the rise in property tax is a very modest increase, he added.ABSD rates were last raisedon Dec 16, as part of a package of government measures to cool the property market.Owning a private residential investment property has always been highly desired amongst Singaporeans and many are willing to bear the premium of home ownership for its yield and potential capital gains.Hence this hike is unlikely to perturb most investors, who could simply raise rentals to cover the additional costs of ownership, said Mr Chung.Added CBREs Ms Song:On its own, the increase in property tax is unlikely to dent investor sentiment, but it will take some winds out of the sails as rents are on the rise. So investor sentiment for high-end property could stay low for a while, coming barely two months after the more significant measures, such as (an increase in) ABSD rates.Seasoned investors also play the long game, said PropertyGurus Dr Tan.(They) often take a longer time horizon perspective on capital appreciation which is also the eventual return on investment. And property tax is scarcely a key determinant of property investment as its deemed to be part of holding costs for property ownership.Alternatively, the higher tax may also prompt existing owners of investment properties or property investors to consider commercial property investments that dont attract ABSD, with property tax rates at 10 per cent of the annual value, he added.While investors may not hesitate to purchase an investment property, the increase in tax rates could trickle down to affect tenants renting these homes, analysts noted.It may be possible that landlords try to pass on the costs to tenants for the centrally located condos and landed properties, as the increase in property tax is quite significant for this segment, said Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie.But she pointed out that there could also be other factors that lead to an increase in rental costs, such as inflation and rising interest rates.For areas that see a big increase in housing supply, it may be harder for landlords to raise rental prices due to increased competition for tenants, added Ms Sun.Landlords are obligated in tenancy agreements to pay taxes, Dr Tan said.Even if landlords take the increased property tax into consideration when revising rents in lease renewals, this may only affect tenants whose rents are above S$10,000 per month, given that the tax hikes are steeper for more luxurious properties.However, Dr Tan highlighted that the overall rental market is flourishing and a vibrant private rental market can be expected this year.Locals are fuelling the rental market. The strong demand is driven by those who are choosing to rent while waiting for their homes to be completed as well as single millennials and unmarried couples who want to move out of their family homes due to insufficient space and privacy, he said.As more vaccinated travel lanes are introduced and expatriates return, the competition for rental units is set to climb.Property owners who spoke with CNA were divided on their views towards the hike.Mary (not her real name) said in an email to CNA that she was \"upset\" aboutthe latest increase in non-owner occupied property taxes.The 58-year-old who works in the electronics industry said she came from a very poor family and worked hard to reach a higher income enough to own two properties, of which one is tenanted.The Government is always focusing on helping the low- and middle-income. Have (they) ever considered that there are people who choose not to work hard and study hard ...to enjoy the financial benefits from the Government? she said.At the moment, Mary pays about S$1,200 in property taxes amonth, which adds up to about S$15,000 of property tax for 2021, she told CNA.The increase in property taxes should be a case-by-case basis, she added.Some people inherit it from their parents and they may not be rich but they have to suffer the high tax. Some people worked very hard, like me, but I have to pay high taxes. For example, my company gave me a S$300 monthly salary increment but I had to pay S$400 more tax per month because I have a second property, she said.Some people are very rich and they can easily afford and own properties; tax is nothing to them as they are cash-rich. Some rich people evade tax by using their childrens name to buy properties I know of friends who did this.Mary said she may consider selling her investment propertyas she is sick and tired of rising taxes and has no means to continue to suffer high taxes.But she wont raise the rent for her tenants to cushion the impact of the tax hike, as the rental market is very competitive.On the other hand, another owner who only wanted to be known as Li Fen told CNA that the tax increase is still doable.Its definitely a pain, itll definitely hit your pocket, but only because we see it as over S$1,000, almost S$2,000. But if you divide it up monthly, it is a couple of hundred dollars. So I think its still doable, said the 44-year-old owner of two tenanted properties.Unlike Mary, the tax increase wouldnt prompt her to sell her investment properties, she added.You know, home ownership comes with a lot of costs, you have insurance, property tax, maintenance and things like that. In fact, the maintenance charges (can be) higher than the property tax itself. So I don't think all this will affect the decision to sell a property, especially if you can get a good rental yield. It simply makes the rental yield lower.In fact, Li Fen said the ability to pay taxes means youre privileged enough, and there are people whod rather pay taxes than to be poor.I can understand why the Government does this, because you really want to tax those who can afford it. If you tax the super-rich billionaires and millionaires, they're not going to stay in Singapore. Theyre going to move elsewhere where the taxes are low, and in the end, whos going to bear the tax burden? Normal people like us.So I think if you spread out the tax a little I mean, I'm not saying don't tax the rich. Yes, we should still tax them. But not a sudden increase.Li Fen added that the percentage increase is okay, since initiatives to help residents, such as the Jobs Support Scheme, would depend on taxes.A lot of things have increased (in price) even before the GST (Goods and Services Tax)has been implemented. So I think the lower-income group has been suffering, and if we can pay a little more tax just to make their lives easier, Im quite okay, she shared.Im really not paying a lot; the increase is not so bad that its going to bankrupt me. I may just get less rental yield. But if I can help the poor, then okay, I'm fine with that. It's like redistribution of riches."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Older commercial premises are also earmarked for redevelopment to enhance their asset values.In addition, the industrial building demand in the private sector is expected to see some support from the construction of energy storage facilities and biopharmaceutical manufacturing plants.The preliminary total construction demand for 2021 increased by 42 per cent to about S$30 billion compared to 2020. This was largely driven by public housing and infrastructure projects, as well as an improvement in investment sentiments, said BCA.This figurewasabout 7 per cent higher than the upper bound of BCA's earlier forecast of S$23 billion to S$28 billion, mainly due to an increase in tender prices resulting from manpower and materials cost inflation.The public sector construction demand rose from S$12.2 billion in 2020 to S$18.2 billion in 2021, underpinned by major projects such as the Cross Island Line, the Jurong Region Line, the Tuas Water Reclamation Plant and new Build-To-Order units.Construction demand in the private sector also rose from S$8.9 billion in 2020 to S$11.8 billion in 2021, supported by higher demand for residential, commercial and industrial building developments as the economy recovers.Over the medium-term, BCA said it expects the total construction demand to reach between S$25 billion and S$32 billion per year from 2023 to 2026.The projection excludes the Changi AirportTerminal 5 development and its associated infrastructure projects, as well as the expansion of the two Integrated Resorts. This is due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic that could affect the construction schedules.The public sector is expected to lead the demand, contributingS$14 billion to S$18 billion per year from 2023 to 2026, said BCA. About half of the demand will comefrom building projects and the other half from civil engineering works, it added.Besides public housing developments, there are also various major developments in the pipeline.Developments include MRT projects such as Phases 2 and 3 of the Cross Island Line, its Punggol Extension and the Downtown Lines Extension to Sungei Kadut. There is also the Toa Payoh Integrated Development, redevelopment of Alexandra Hospital and a new integrated hospital in Bedok.\"The private sector construction demand is projected to remain steady over the medium-term, reaching about S$11 billion to S$14 billion per year from 2023 to 2026, in view of a healthy investment appetite amid Singapores strong economic fundamentals,\" said BCA.The total nominal construction output, or value of certified progress payments, is projected to increase to S$29 billion to S$32 billion for 2022, it added. This is from the preliminary estimate of about S$26 billion for 2021.This is due to a steady level of construction demand and the backlog of remaining workloads that were affected by the pandemic since 2020, said the authority.Editors note: This article has been amended following clarifications made by BCA in an updated press release, as well as to correct an error aboutthe total construction demand for 2021."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Some sellers may start adjusting their price expectations as well,\" she added.Prices are not expected to fall because demand \"is likely to remain robust\", and construction of new flats may still be delayed, she said.Mr Lim said the lowered LTV does not affect those that have a stronger financial ability, such as those with money in theirCentral Provident Fund or as cash savings.\"Also, many buyers may also be more inclined to take bank loans for their resale HDB flat purchases, as currently, the housing loan interest rates offered by banks are lower and more attractive than HDBs 2.6 per cent,\" said Mr Lim.He added that due to strong demand, increasingly higher resale HDB prices in 2022 can be expected.In February, about 3,900 Build-to-Order (BTO) flats will be offered in towns or estates such as Geylang, Kallang Whampoa, Tengah and Yishun.In May, HDB will offer \"about 5,200 to 5,700\"BTO flats in towns or estates such as Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Queenstown, Tampines, Toa Payoh and Yishun.\"This number is subject to review as more project details will be firmed up closer to the launch date,\" said HDB.(Source: HDB)"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: AP/Zen Soo)SINGAPORE: Come Friday (Feb 18), Singaporeans will get an answer to arguably the most anticipated questions of 2022 so far: When the 2 percentage point hike in Goods and Services Tax (GST) will take place and whether itll happen in one go.The increase from 7 per cent to 9 per cent was slated sometime between 2021 and 2025 but had been held off given the economic impact of COVID-19. The run-up to Budget 2022 has set the public speculating about whether itll take effect this year. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his New Year message that the Government will have to start moving on the hike in Budget 2022.But it comes at a time of concern about rising costs of living, amid financial woes from the pandemic and Singapores headline inflation for December 2021 hitting a near nine-year high. Since the less well-off pay more GST as a percentage of their income than high-earners, perhaps the bigger question around this hike is this: Can we make GST less regressive?More specifically, some people are asking if having different GST rates for essential and non-essential goods can help lessen the impact of the hike on Singaporeans.The reasoning goes, that everyone must buy must-have items which should be kept affordable, while the higher-income have room for discretionary spending on good-to-haves that could be taxed more.Some countries, in fact, treat certain basic necessities as exempt supplies, including Asian countries such as India, Indonesia and South Korea, or subject them to a reduced GST rate compared to the standard rate. Foodstuffs, for example, are taxed at 5.5 per cent instead of 20 per cent in France, or zero-rated instead of 10 per cent in Australia.Like Singapore, New Zealand charges a broad-based 15 per cent GST, and basic necessities are treated as taxable standard-rated supplies.In Singapore, the Government has long resisted this move to treat basic necessities as exempt supplies since GST was first implemented in 1994. It opted instead for a broad-based system with very few exemptions that do not include food or healthcare. The Governments rationale is that exempting basic necessities from GST will help everyone but end up benefitting the wealthy more as they spend more. Instead, it considers it a fairer approach to target assistance for lower- and middle-income households through measures like GST vouchers and absorbing GST for healthcare services consumed by subsidised patients. A S$6 billion Assurance Package was also announced to offset the upcoming hike for five to 10 years.It is unclear how much a zero or reduced GST rate might affect tax revenue and hinder the Governments ability to finance targeted assistance schemes, or to fund the increased public spending that motivated the hike in the first place.A shortfall might mean the GST rate could be raised again in future or offsets that can be channelled to help the less well-off could be lower. Counterintuitive as it may seem, a lower tax rate for certain goods and services may backfire in its goal of helping lower-income households.But given that GST accounts for only slightly more than one-fifth of tax revenue on average, perhaps a stronger drawback of a multi-rate GST system is just how tricky and potentially costly implementation might be.What qualifies as basic necessities to warrant lower GST rates? In the United Kingdom, foodstuffs are generally exempt from value-added tax (VAT) but a government webpage details the conditions to determine if an item is zero or standard-rated. Roasted nuts are zero-rated if unshelled but draw a 20 per cent standard rate if shelled for example. Some goods and services may also run up against the issue of fairness: Women in Germany used to fork out 19 per cent tax on sanitary products, the so-called tampon tax that categorised them as luxury items.The law must be clear in defining the basket of goods in each GST category. Disagreement between tax authorities and taxpayers may lead to classification issues and potential legal disputes that can only be settled in the courts. Multiple GST rates may be confusing, if certain goods and services potentially fall under different classifications. Imagine: If biscuits are charged 10 per cent GST while chocolates are charged 20 per cent, then what would the GST rate for a bar of KitKat be?A single-rate system will also be simpler for both authorities to administer and businesses to comply with. Mechanisms needed for a multi-rate system also have a compliance cost that may end up being passed on to consumers instead.The red tape of administrative bottleneck and potential legal disputes can impede collection of the GST and consequently hinder any economic activity.That said, a multi-rate structure is not the only way GST could be tweaked to be less regressive. Currently, all residential properties, regardless of value and the numberpurchased, are regarded as exempt supplies and are not subject to GST, unlike commercial and industrial properties.A way to increase GST revenue is for the Government to consider applying special GST rules within the class of residential properties as a start, to no longer exempt Good Class Bungalows (GCB).Such large, landed properties in prime districts are considered a rare asset and would only be affordable to the ultra-rich, say with a S$20 million threshold based on the open market value at the time of purchase. It will not squeeze the lower- and middle-income.Specific application of GST on such properties would thus be in the same spirit as differentiating essential from luxury goods, compared to property taxes or Buyers Stamp Duty that have been revised in the recent past and for which there might be less appetite to revise so soon again.Given the necessity of the GST increase to shore up Singapores revenues, such bold moves might be simpler and more helpful than a complicated multi-rate GST system.Simon Poh is Associate Professor (Practice) of the Department of Accounting at NUS Business School where he specialises in tax matters."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

What fintech has done is to level the playing field, says chief client officer of Endowus, So Sin Ting.SINGAPORE: French economist Thomas Piketty in his 2015 book, The Economics of Inequality, argued that throughout history, the concept of investing was something reserved only for the wealthy those who have ample assets to stretch beyond lifes necessities. He believes that wealth begets wealth, as there is a tendency of the rate of return on capital to exceed the gross rate of return of the economy. In Singapores earlier years, access to personalised investment advice and a broad range of investment products were exclusively marketed and made accessible to the wealthy, while salaried workers had to contend with relatively low-interest rates in basic savings accounts or fixed deposit products. As Singapore built its reputation as a financial center, new investment platforms were developed and more international asset managers arrived, lowering the barriers to entry for wealth growth and allowing more individuals to invest. One key growth area was the introduction of more investment-skewed insurance products, and this enabled more residents to find new ways to grow their wealth, although arguably many were packaged with high fees and long lock-up periodsWhile these developments helped pave the way for improved market access and a reduced wealth disparity, the average man on the street still faced high broker fees and unclear investment options - something wealthier investors could handle better.Fast forward to the present, and the rise of financial technology (or fintech for short), has brought about an extraordinary opportunity to make change and bridge the wealth gap.Access to institutional quality advice and investments is no longer exclusive only to the wealthy, and the ability to invest to secure a brighter financial future should become a right for everybody.While there is no universal definition of fintech, it is generally understood to mean technology thats used to augment, streamline, digitise or disrupt traditional financial services.Over the past few years, the fintech sector has rapidly evolved. Singapore alone is estimated to be the base of over 750 entities.According to SGX, this accounts for 40 per cent of all Fintech companies within Southeast Asia. Specific to the global robo-adviser segment, it is estimated to reach S$6.2 trillion in 2027. While the pandemic has resulted in a fall in overall fintech funding in Asia, the funding landscape in Singapore has been less volatile, compared to countries around the region, particularly China and India.We have seen fintechs, including robo-adviser firms, in Singapore receive a total of US$3 billion in funding last year, indicating that investors recognise the opportunities looming in this sector. Aside from how much money is flowing into fintech and robo-investment companies, its also changing the way we invest. Based on research done by The Insights Partners, the wealth management platform market, including robo-advisers, is expected to grow from US$2.2billion in 2018 to US$7.2 billion by the year 2027 globally.With hybrid and robo-advisers expected to increase their market share over traditional human advisers, robo-advisers are set to be one of the primary driving forces behind creating more competitive investment offerings, providing consumers with greater access than ever before.This by no means sounds the death knell for human wealth managers it simply means existing talent will pivot, reskilland find more job options when the market takes off with the likes of Grab, Shopee and local banks going digital.In Singapore, data shows that specific fintech products that have seen a big uptake in retail investors are online brokers and digital wealth management platforms, especially among millennials and Gen Zs. The biggest draw for them: The use of technology to dish out advice and boost financial literacy, along with ease of use and much lower fees compared to traditional financial institutions, advisers and brokers.There are digital financial advisers that have also made institutional share classes of investment funds, which are traditionally only accessible to institutional investors such as pension funds, insurers or ultra-high net worth investors investing over six-figure sums or more, available to the average investor. In the case of PIMCO Income Fund for example, investing in the institutional share class of the fund versus the retail share class lowers the fund-level fee by over 60 per cent.This democratisation of investment opportunity means that more of the returns are kept by the average investor, and compounds over time to help build wealth.Globally, however, there are other innovations that open investment opportunities to the masses. One example is real estate crowdfunding, which is said to offer investors a forecasted return on investment of an average of 10 to 15 per cent.How this works is that a group of people, using social media or crowdfunding platforms, can invest for a share to buy a property or as a loan to a developer to finance the property development. Returns are then proportionately shared between the individual investors. It is estimated by Ernst & Young that this segment would have funds of around US$9 billion in 2021, and an estimated compound annual growth rate of 18.5 per cent.This example highlights how an asset class previously inaccessible to the average investor a single real estate investment could be prohibitively expensive, let alone a portfolio of investments is now available for the masses to help grow their wealth.Other innovative platforms like Moonfare and ADDX make alternative and private equity investments available in smaller bite sizes, with the latter also removing lockups for private markets.Consumer education remains the key plank to avoid unnecessary loss but The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulates financial institutions to ensure that they are not marketing products as risk-free.A key trigger that brought not just money but everyone with a smartphone into this space was the approach to fees and commissions. You may have seen many online brokers advertising low to even no commission fees.For those who do charge a commission, it is usually a fixed fee, with many as low as S$1 per transaction. This is compared to traditional brokers who charge on average 0.25 per cent of your trades, with a minimum of S$10per transaction. Trailer fees are often given as incentives for financial advisers to promote certain funds to their customers, and this results in a major conflict of interest, as advisers are more motivated by the commission they earn, rather than identifying which funds are best suited for their customers. What this means is that a young and budding investor, say a 21-year-old tech-savvy university student, can not only set up an account independently, but have access to an appropriate investment solution based on his risk profile. Without the obligation to commit to a locked-in investment plan with high transaction fees, the young investor is free to set up a regular savings plan, investing consistently across global market peaks and troughs and building good investing habits. They may also invest their retirement nest egg, such as CPF and Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) or try out investing in specific sectors or themes (satellite investing) using advised portfolios as they begin their foray into the working world.Banks are also focusing on developing digital-only banking solutions, with the central banks of Singapore and Malaysia issuing digibank licenses. Traditional financial institutions are trying to launch their own fintech solutions, serving fintechas a service rather than trying to block fintechs from thriving. According to Statista and BCG, as of November 2021, there were 6,268 fintech startups in Asia Pacific, as compared to about 50 digital banks that provide financial services directly to consumers and businesses.While fintech firms have created a niche for the tech-savvy, young investor who appreciates immediacy and a sense of ownership, it is also essential to assess the risk of each fintech product, in the same way one would diversify their investment portfolio traditionally. Some products focus more on access but leave the choice and risk-taking entirely to the investor while others balance access and advice. Both have a part to play in lowering the risk of losing their money and growing ones wealth.The fintech product offerings, however, are set to grow even more diverse in future. Online brokers and digital advisers might even be just the tip of the iceberg, as fintech start-ups around the world look for more ways to bring wealth growth to the masses. You even see in other parts of the world, Buy Now Pay Later fintechs start introducing savings accounts. Locally, you also have Grab, built up on the back of ride hailing and food delivery services, as well as e-commerce giant Sea being granted digital banking licences.It is also worth noting that MAS played a big part in the rise of the fintech industry locally. The FinTech Regulatory Sandbox framework created by MAS allowed fintech players to experiment with innovative financial products or services in a live environment within a well-defined space and duration. This resulted in the industry learning how to contain failures without affecting the security of the financial system, under relaxed legal and regulatory requirements. Such innovation also fuelled the safe and secure growth of the fintech industry in Singapore.This type of public-private partnership has also helped foster a new generation of investors who, having been raised by mobile phone nannies, will be the future of investing.

(Photo: iStock)SINGAPORE: The number of consumer complaints against renovation contractors jumped by almost 50 per centin 2021, with nearly half of themabout unsatisfactory workmanship or contractors failing to complete projects on schedule.This comes as theConsumers Association of Singapore (CASE) released consumer complaints data for 2021 on Monday (Jan 31). A total of 15,515 complaints were logged last year, down 15.3 per cent from the 18,335 complaints in 2020, said CASE.\"The decrease is largely attributed to a significant drop in the number of complaints against the travel and medical and medical consumables industries,\" said CASE.Of the 15,515 complaints, CASE advised 86.7 per cent of the consumers how to resolve their disputes with the businesses. It also helped 13.3 per cent of the consumers negotiate and mediate their disputes with businesses.In all, CASE said that 64.7 per cent of those cases were resolved, with S$2 million - in-cash and in-kind - recovered for consumers.The association said the composition of consumer complaints it received in 2021 has returned to pre-2020 levels, an \"early sign\" that consumer purchasing behaviour and habits in Singapore have stabilised to pre-pandemic levels.CASE received 1,300 complaints against home renovation contractors in 2021, up almost 50 per cent from the 869 complaints in 2020.\"Close to half of the complaints against the industry were about renovation contractors failing to complete projects on schedule and unsatisfactory workmanship,\" said the association.The increase in complaints was attributed to the prolonged shortage in manpower and raw materials arising from continued border restrictions due to COVID-19, pent-up demand in the residential property market, as well as a corresponding demand for home renovation last year.To protect their interests, consumers are advised to avoid making large sums of prepayment upfront, and to negotiate for progressive payments to be made as each stage of the renovation work is completed, said CASE president Melvin Yong.CASE also said that consumers who prepaid for items or services such as beauty and bridal packages took a greater hit last year.Consumers suffered more than S$520,000 in prepayment losses last year, a sharp increase from the S$190,000 reported in the previous year.The beauty and bridal industries saw the greatest amount of prepayment losses in 2021. Consumers who made prepayments for beauty and bridal packages were unable to get a refund of their money due to business insolvency.Prepayment protection is an area of deep concern for CASE,\" said Mr Yong.To better protect consumers against \"hefty financial losses\" due to company closures, Mr Yong said CASE has called on the Government to consider mandating prepayment protection in industries that collect large sums of prepayment.\"And as part of licensing conditions, require the industry to better inform consumers of the steps they can take to protect themselves against business closure,\" said Mr Yong.Complaints against the beauty industry took the top spot, accounting for almost one in 10 complaints received in 2021, said CASE.The association received 1,434 complaints against the industry last year, a 5 per cent increase over 2020.About one quarter of complaints against spas and beauty salons were related to pressure sales tactics and misleading claims.Some consumers complained they were not allowed to leave the beauty salons unless they bought higher price packages, others said expensive treatments were performed on them without their consent and that they were then charged for those treatments.There were also complaints about beauty salons misleading consumers on the number of sessions in the packages and how certain treatments could cure or alleviate pre-existing health ailments.To safeguard consumers against such unfair practices in the industry, CASE signed a Voluntary Compliance Agreement with one beauty salon and referred three others to theCompetition and Consumer Commission of Singapore for investigation in 2021.To address \"perennial complaints\" from consumers that they were pressured to buy a package deal, Mr Yong said CASE has called on the Government to extend the coverage of the mandatorycooling-off period under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) (Cancellation of Contracts) Regulations to spa and beauty purchases.This will allow time for consumers to consider their purchase and provide them an avenue to cancel their purchases, said Mr Yong.In contrast, the travel industry saw a 62.6 per cent drop in the number of complaints last year.The industry had previously topped the list of consumer complaints in 2020, according to CASE data released last year.A \"substantial\" proportion of the complaints were related to travel bookings made before the onset of COVID-19, said CASE.\"Some consumers complained that they were unable to get refunds for expired travel vouchers previously given for flights or tour packages which were postponed in 2020,\" it added.Additionally, there were 18 complaints related to vaccinated travel lane flight bookings and bus tickets. Most of these were related to changes in flight bookings and quarantine issues.\"Given the evolving global travel restrictions, consumers are advised to purchase tickets from airlines which offer complimentary rebooking of flights,\" said Mr Yong.Consumers were also advised to read through the terms and conditions of the flight booking or tour package, and to take note of written provisions for refunds and cancellations.The association received 2,206 complaints related to online purchases in 2021, accounting for about 14 per cent of the total complaints received.The number is a 49 per cent decline over the 4,366 complaints received in 2020, due to a sharp drop in complaints related to face masks, hand sanitisers, airline tickets and tour packages.The two most common types of e-commerce complaints in 2021 were related to defected or \"non-conforming goods\", as well as delivery issues such as delayed deliveries, incomplete deliveries and wrong deliveries.\"As the digital economy evolves, new retail practices will emerge, and consumer shopping habits will change accordingly,\" said Mr Yong.To help consumers resolve e-commerce complaints \"quickly and efficiently\", CASE launched a framework in 2021.\"(It)provides guidance to e-marketplaces to align dispute resolution processes and give consumers assurance when they shop,\" he said.Lazada Singapore has signed a memorandum of understanding with CASE to adopt the framework.\"We hope that more e-marketplaces will come on board soon, so that their customers can have peace of mind shopping on their platforms, said Mr Yong.Consumers are encouraged to patronise CaseTrust-accredited businesses, which are committed to fair business practices and consumer-friendly policies, said CASE.These businesses are also required to attend mediation with consumers should disputes reach a deadlock.In 2021, the resolution rate of consumer disputes involving CaseTrust-accredited businesses was 73.6 per cent, higher than the 64.4 per cent resolution rate for non-accredited businesses.Businessesaccredited under the CaseTrust Renovation and Spa and Wellness scheme are required to protect consumers prepayments or deposits, said the association.CaseTrust-accredited spas and wellness businesses offer a five-day cooling-off period for consumers, while CaseTrust-accredited renovation contractorsare required to protect consumers' prepayments via the purchase of a deposit performance bond, said CASE.Overall, complaints against the beauty and renovation contractor industries remain a concern, said Mr Yong.\"CASE will continue to engage the Government and industry stakeholders to strengthen consumer safeguards and stamp out unfair practices in a timely manner.\"We will also work with trade associations to increase the CaseTrust accreditation rates for industries with a high number of complaints, so as to reduce undesirable business practices and better protect consumers.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

They are also located at upcoming residential estates and should see strong demand from upgraders.\"Of the sites on the Confirmed List, Marina Gardens Lane, Tampines Avenue 11 and Tengah Plantation Loop (EC) are new sites. The other three sites, Bukit Timah Link, Hillview Rise and Lentor Gardens are transferred from the Reserve List in the previous Programme.Analysts say the Marina Gardens Lane site, which is located next to Gardens by the Bay and overlooks the Marina Reservoir and the Straits of Singapore, is expected to be well-received.\"This is the first time the government is launching a site in the Marina South neighbourhood,\" said Ms He.\"Based on the latest Masterplan, it is one of five sites in the area with residential and commercial at the first storey, among other white sites, and is expected to kickstart development in the area where it will be a sustainable, car-lite estate comprising a mix of residential, commercial and hotel uses. Located near the CBD, it is also in line with the authoritys vision of turning the CBD into a more vibrant area for work live play,\" she added.The site, expected to launch in December, can yield about 795 residential units and 750 sq m of commercial space.\"The Marina Gardens Lane site is the best site on the 2H 2022 Confirmed List. It offers a first-mover advantage to both developers and buyers. It is right next to Gardens by the Bay and will be directly linked to Marina South MRT station,\" noted Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research at Huttons Asia.Aside from the Marina Gardens Lane site, analysts also say the Tampines Ave 11 commercial and residential site will appeal to developers.\"HDB has launched several BTO projects in Tampines North over the past few years and one EC project will be launched for sale soon,\" said Mr Lee.\"Despite the increase in residents, there is a dearth of amenities like a mall in the area. The 1,190-unit mixed commercial and residential site at Tampines Ave 11 will inject much-needed amenities to the area.\"Planned and announced every six months, GLS programmes release state land for private development.Land on the Confirmed List is launched for sale at pre-determined dates, with most land parcels sold through tenders.Land on the Reserve List, meanwhile, is not released for tender immediately, but is made available for application. A Reserve List site is put up for tender when a developer indicates a minimum price which is accepted by the government.In this Programme, there are eight sites on the Reserve List, which can yield an additional 3,805 private residential units (including 1,000 EC units), 80,000 sq m gross floor area of commercial space and 530 hotel rooms.Of these, six are private residential sites (including two ECs sites), one white site and one hotel site.The supply on the reserve list will give developers a good selection of sites to initiate for development if they assess that there is demand, said URA.The Government will continue to monitor economic and property market conditions closely and adjust the supply of future GLS Programmes, as necessary.\"Editor's note:This story has been corrected to reflect the accurate number of units available under the Confirmed List of the Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme for the second half of this year.

Their leases will expire early next year, SLA added.Similar tenders will be offered for the other blocks in the second phase of the rejuvenation, it said.The tenders will remain open for eight weeks from Tuesday, and applicants will be evaluated based on price and quality.The quality component will consider whether the proposal incorporates green initiatives, part of SLA's initiative to make Gillman Barracks an eco-friendly precinct, said SLA.Gillman Barracks will also get an \"overall facelift\", with upgrading works targeted to be completed by early-2023, said SLA in the press release.Common washrooms will be upgraded with eco-friendly sanitary fittingsand a new thematic playground will be built, it announced.Withthe sitea 10-minute walk from Labrador Park MRT, there are also plans to introduce additional covered linkways at selected walking paths to improve the connectivity among the 17 blocks.Gillman Barracks is also situated next to a park connector network along the Alexandra Garden Trail, which linksHort Park, Labrador Park and the Southern Ridges, said SLA, describing it as an \"ideal pitstop\" for cyclists and hikers.The site will offer free parking on weekends, public holidays and weekdays from 5pm to 8.30am the next day, said SLA.Responding to a question about low human traffic at Gillman Barracks, Mr Low saidconsumers are looking for new concepts and new places to go.The community or social workshops that the tenders call for will be an \"interesting kind of differentiator\", compared to \"a typical rental unit\", he added.\"It could be in a retail mall, in an air-conditioned complex, but there are not many places in Singapore that have this unique offering of large grounds, greenery,\" he said.\"The five tenders that we aregoing to launch today also include outdoor recreational areas.

Theywill also get the option to buy a new flat with a fresh 99-year lease at subsidised prices, the agencies said.The residents will be prioritisedfor about 1,100 new replacement flats at Woodlands Street 13, expected to be built by the fourth quarter of 2027. The authorities said these flats have better design and fittings, and are located near to \"modern and comprehensive facilities\".Eligible flat owners may receive a Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) grant of up to S$30,000 and take out a housing loan from HDB for the purchase of their new flat.The residents and tenants CNA spoke to on Thursday said the news came suddenly, although some of them pointed to rumours over the years of an en bloc exercise in their neighbourhood.Many said they would also consider moving to other HDB developments, beyond the ones at Woodlands Street 13.The residents received a text messagefrom the authorities about the news at around noon on Thursday, while officers from the relevant agencies went door-to-door at the affected blocks to address concerns.Some residents were seen discussing the development with each other at the common areas as HDB officers went around the neighbourhood pulling trolleys of information booklets.Private hiredriver Mohd Said Abdullah, 66, has been living in Block 212 for 22 years. He said he had intended to stay at the four-room corner flatfor the rest of his life so his three children could inherit it in the future.\"A couple of people came (a few years ago) wanting to buy, but I thought of my children being happy visiting me here,\" he said. He also loves how roomy his 109 sq m home is, and that the neighbourhood has good amenities and green spaces, he added.But Mr Said explained that he is not angry aboutthe move, as he believes in fate and that\"life has to move on\".\"If we are angry, what can we do? It's like if we are angry about chickens (from Malaysia) not coming in, what can we do? If there is no chicken, find other options and eat fish,\" he said.Still, he is unsure about moving to the new flatsat Woodlands Street 13 as he is wary of the more compact Build-to-Order flats. Instead, he plans to look for a bigger resale flat to move to nearby, although he accepts that he will have to forgo the SERS grant.\"I don't intend to wait six years for the new flats,\" he added. \"I might not be alive by then.\"Block 217 resident Colin Wong, a final-year undergraduate, said he was shocked by the news as he has become attached to the neighbourhood he grew up in.\"When you stay here for such a long time, the compensation package is a factor but it's not the most important factor. The most important factor is actually the emotional connection to theplace,\" the 25-year-old said.\"And if you have to shift, it should be to somewhere better so that it's not so painful.\"Mr Wong said he is eyeing an upcoming HDB development near Causeway Point instead of thenew flats at Woodlands Street 13, as he would prefer to be closer to Woodlands MRT station.However, he conceded that he would not get priority for those flats, and that they could be oversubscribed due to the popular location. \"But I will try,\" he added. \"I am in talks with my parents and maybe we will make a trip down to HDB one day.\"Likewise, Block 212 resident Ishak Halil said he was \"shocked\" at the sudden news, especially as he had only moved in to his three-room flat two years ago, and renovated the unit recently.\"We like the place here; it's quiet and we have good neighbours,\" the 57-year-oldsaid, as he sat outside his unit and flippedthrough booklets given by the HDB officers who had visited.\"In my age now, I thought this is the final house we are going to be staying in. Suddenly en bloc, so we have to move again.\"Mr Ishak, a home renovation contractor, said he intends to stay in his current three-room flat for as long as he can. He said he hadbought the unit for around S$200,000, and that he intends to see how much compensation he will get before deciding on his next move.\"We just renovated, so we already spent quite a sum of money,\" he added. \"They (the authorities) should make all the residents here happy.\"After staying in Block 213 for 23 years, a resident who wanted to be known Mdm Wong said she feels \"very sad\" about having to move out as the neighbourhood is \"very good\".\"The people here have the kampung spirit and help each other,\" the 48-year-old homemaker said. \"Everyone in this block knows each other.\"Mdm Wong questioned why Blocks 30 to 36, located on the other side of Marsiling Drive and also near to Woodlands Checkpoint, would not be affected by the redevelopment.\"If they really wanted to do something to the checkpoint, I supposeit would have been on that side and not our side,\" she said, adding that she is unsure if she will move to the new flats.Commercial tenants at Block 210 were more accepting of the news.Mr Winson Ng, managing director of Yassin Kampung Groupwhich runs a seafood restaurant at the block, called the news\"sudden and surprising\" but not unexpected as they had predicted that the estate would be redeveloped one day.In fact, it is the second time that his outlet had to move after its previous location atBlock1A Woodlands Centre Road was selected for SERS in 2012.\"HDB has provided some form of assistance for the affected business owners,\" Mr Ng said, adding that thegroup will open another eatery in Yishun. \"Its too early to tell now but our team is always prepared for all challenges coming ahead.\"Eligible rental commercial tenants will get benefits including a 10 per centrental discount for the first tenancy term at a HDB rental shop or eating house elsewhere, and a S$30,000 relocation assistance if they areSingaporean small- and medium-sized enterprise tenants who continue operations elsewhere.Mr Noor Sobri Mohamed Noor, who runs a chain of barber shops in Woodlands including one at Block 210, said he is fine about moving out as he knows it is for the greater good of expanding Woodlands Checkpoint.There is a tinge of regret, however, as his shop has been there for five years making it one of his oldest and was also recently renovated. The 33-year-old also grew up in the area and studied at nearby Woodlands Secondary School.\"I'm a bit sad because I lived in that area and soon it will be no more,\" he said.Mr Sobri hopes the authorities will assign him another rental shop in the Woodlands area, as he is confident his customers will remain loyal to him if the location is similar.\"I will just prepare for the worst and hope for the best,\" he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: Google Street View)SINGAPORE: The site in Ang Mo Kio that has been identified fortheHousing and Development Board's(HDB)Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) offers significant potential for redevelopment, said analysts, citing factors such as its location andproximity to a future MRT station.This is the first SERS announcement in four years, with four HDB blocks in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3picked for the scheme. More than 600 households will be affected by the move, HDB said onThursday (Apr 7).The land parcel is \"well-located\" beside the CTE and it is within walking distance to the upcoming Tavistock MRT station on the Cross Island Line, notedOrangeTee & Tie's senior vice president of research and analytics Christine Sun.\"It is also situated near the landed properties at Serangoon Gardens. Therefore any new high rise buildings will enjoy good views due to the low rise landed housing,\" she said.Ms Sun added that the site could have been selected to facilitate theconstruction of the underground MRT station.\"More space may be needed for construction. The deep excavation and construction works of the MRT station could also impact the structural soundness of surrounding buildings especially the safety of residents living in older buildings,\" she said.Huttons Asia's senior director for research Lee Sze Teck said that the site may have been chosen also because of theavailability of a site to build replacement homes \"not too far from the current location\".\"With this site freed up, it is possible to have more flats nearby to undergo SERS. This site could be used to build replacement flats for SERS,\" he said.Dr Lee Nai Jia, Deputy Director at the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS), said there is potential to build taller blocks.\"I think 36 storeys is the maximum. So I think there's still a lot of room for it to be redeveloped into either newer developments, newer public housing developments or private housing developments,\" he added.Sharing the sentiment, Ms Sun said: \"Currently, the old housing blocks are around 13 storeys whereas the land can be built up to around 36 storeys. Therefore, the land may be acquired via SERs to be redeveloped to optimise the land usage.\"I think that piece of land could be redeveloped into a few tall blocks, which may even be an integrated development comprising some retail or commercial components linked to the Tavistock MRT station.\"PropNex Realty's head of research and content Wong Siew Ying noted that the plot of land is not far fromseveral schools and many amenities such as the Chong Boon Market and Food Centre, AMK Hub and Ang Mo Kio bus interchange and MRT station.\"As for site attributes, it is a regular-shaped site that appears to be quite large and presents significant redevelopment potential in the future. As the fourblocks are sitting on a relatively huge plot and are fairly spaced out, the site can offer intensification of land use and an increase in density for future housing developments,\" she added.SERS, introduced in 1995, is part of the Government's efforts to renew older housing estates.Ms Sun notedthat past SERS projects were carried out about every two years between 2014 and 2018.Most of the SERS projects comprise about four to fewer than 10 blocks of flats, excluding the one at Tanglin Halt, which involved many blocks.\"Therefore, the general SERS exercises, based on past records, do not usually involve many flats and are not done on a regular basis, unless the authorities decide to relook and change their SERS policy,\" she added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Illustration: TODAY/Anam Musta'ein)SINGAPORE: For some pandemic-hit business owners in Singapore, the road to recovery has been anything but smooth, even though almost a year has passed since the country gradually eased COVID-19 restrictions and reopened the economy from April last year.The challenges they face include rising costs of goods, utilities, labour or just finding sufficient manpower, and that perennial bugbear - rent.And this confluence of headwinds has left some proprietors dismayed.As the owner of a bar located in a trendy part of central Singapore put it: My revenue is not there, but I still have to pay rent by hook or by crook ... to be in business.The 38-year-old man declined to be named as he fears offending his landlord, an individual who owns several shophouses in the area.The bar owner told TODAY that he currently pays more than S$20,000 in rent a month, which forms about 30 per cent of business expenses.While the current rent is lower than the S$28,000 he used to pay before the pandemic struck, he said that business is no longer what it used to be. The bar is in an area which was once the haunt of expatriates, but they have now largely disappeared, he said.Added to the fact that Chinese tourists have yet to return, his daily takings have dropped to less than 50 per cent of what they used to be pre-COVID-19. Yet despite this drop in earnings, his landlord did not want to talk about the possibility of lowering rent further.It feels like the past three years, (were) just working for the landlord only. Just paying them, he said.He has not raised the prices on the menu yet to make up for any shortfall in earnings, since this may cost him to lose customers.As it is, he reasoned that many are already unhappy about having to pay the 1 percentage point increase in the Goods and Services Tax, which kicked in at the start of the year.Indeed, raising the prices of goods in Singapore is not so simple for some retailers, particularly those who have an overseas presence, such as Mr Terence Yow. He is the managing director of Enviably Me, the official distributor of the Melissa brand of fashion footwear in Singapore, Malaysia and India.Mr Yow said that there is a recommended global pricing to follow when it comes to selling his womens footwear, and if he were to raise his prices by 30 per cent to cover the increase in business costs, he would lose his business to e-commerce platforms.On top of this, inflation has hurt consumer confidence.People might still go out to eat, but they are definitely de-prioritising their product purchases, especially in the fashion lifestyle area, he said.To keep his overheads low, Mr Yow has had to give up good shop locations to bring the cost of rent down.If he had stuck to the prime shop locations, the overall cost of rent for his business would have easily increased by 10 per cent.Mr Yow, who is also chairman of the Singapore Tenants United for Fairness, observed that rental increases have been uneven across the island.Suburban malls, for example, are seeing rentals going up higher than pre-COVID-19, he said.However, in the central business district area, he said it is a mixed picture, with rents in some areas being lower than what they were before the pandemic, while others have risen higher or stayed constant.Much ink has previously been spilled about the imbalance of power between landlords and their tenants, which even led the Singapore Business Federation to create guidelines aimed at putting a stop to unfair leasing practices in 2015, after companies reported surprise jumps in rents when renewing leases.In spite of this, TODAY reported in 2020 that the situation had not improved. In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic had brought the schism between landlords and tenants to the fore, and there were calls by tenants struggling to survive to have their rents lowered.These simmering tensions eventually led to the formation of the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee (FTIC) in 2021 to address the long-standing disparity in power.With commercial rents projected to grow this year, the question is how will this impact businesses already grappling with rising costs and whether they have to pass on these costs to consumers in an already inflationary environment.While the COVID-19 pandemic saw rents across global prime retail destinations declining by 13 per cent on average during the depth of the pandemic, commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield said in a report published in November 2022 that they have rebounded to just 6 per cent below pre-pandemic levels.In Singapore, the rental trends for both the office and retail sectors have been mixed, according to historical data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) respective price indices, which reflect general price movements.For instance, the rental index of office space in the central region showed that it has been fluctuating since at least 2017, when it rose from close to 165 points in the fourth quarter of that year and peaked at 176.8 points during the second quarter of 2019.The pandemic saw it plummeting to a low of 155.5 points in the fourth quarter of 2020. Since the third quarter of 2021, it has climbed steadily and surpassed 2019s peak as of the fourth quarter of last year to reach 176.9 points.Dr Lee Nai Jia, head of real estate intelligence, data and software solutions at PropertyGuru Group, said that office rents are rising because most employees are shifting away from remote working arrangements and returning to working in offices, and there is limited supply in the short run.Meanwhile, a similar index from URA for retail spaces in the central region showed it has generally been trending downwards over the same period.The fourth quarter of 2019 similarly saw a high of 101 points, before it slid down to about 80 points in the third quarter of 2021 and has largely remained flat since. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the retail rental index stood at about 78 points.Giving its projections for this year, Cushman & Wakefield said in a market outlook report published last December that it expects rental growth for retail sectors to trend upwards from this year.The company said Orchard prime retail rents are expected to have grown by 4.2 per cent year-on-year in 2022, followed by a 2.5 per cent year-on-year growth in 2023, as Singapores tourism continues to recover.Supported by a return to office by workers, other city area rents are also expected to increase by 1.5 per cent year-on-year in 2023.Suburban prime retail spaces remain sought after by retailers and are supported by nearby residential catchments and hybrid work. This is reflected by tight vacancy rates (6.1 per cent as of Q3 2022) in suburban retail areas, said the report.Suburban prime retail rents are expected to have grown by 3.8 per cent year-on-year in 2022 and 2.0 per cent year-on-year in 2023, fuelled by inflation and limited supply of prime retail space, it said.So what drives rent in Singapore, and how is it calculated?According to a code of conduct crafted by the Fair Tenancy Pro Tem Committee concerning lease negotiations between retailers and landlords, rental formulas must be based on a single computation throughout the lease term, instead of an either/or, whichever is higher formula.For instance, rental can be based on floor area, the amount of sales, or a combination of both but there cannot be a clause that allows tenants to be charged whichever amount is higher.This can only be included if both parties agree to it, and make a joint declaration to the FTIC, which was set up to monitor compliance with the guidelines.While it is currently not mandatory to follow the guidelines, the initiative is pending legislation after the Government carried out a public consultation last year about enshrining it into law.Mr Wong Xian Yang, head of research at Cushman & Wakefield in Singapore, noted that commercial rents are driven by demand-supply dynamics, a landlords confidence of current market rent, and to some extent property operating costs.With higher inflation, property operating costs have increased, and some landlords have factored this into their lease negotiations.There are also market nuances to consider, added Mr Wong. For instance, the top malls are able to attract the bulk of footfalls and raise rents, while the weaker malls have to grapple with higher vacancy rates.To illustrate, the following are the median monthly rent in terms of cost per square foot retail tenants have to pay based on where they are located, according to URAs fourth quarter 2022 data.To aid orientation, TODAY has added names of shopping malls found within the respective vicinities.Mr Tan Chee Wee, executive director of the advocacy and policy division at Singapore Business Federation, said that since the FTIC was officially set up in May 2021, it had received 23 complaints, but none were related to rent.Instead, they were mainly on matters such as pre-termination of lease beyond the stipulated conditions under the code of conduct, and interest for late rent.The federation is the committees secretariat.While Singapore Business Federation said that there have been no reported complaints about rent so far, numerous articles in the past have blamed Singapores Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) for prioritising investor returns, which causes unjustifiable rent increases.The following are some of the major REIT players in Singapore, along with the number of retail malls they own in the country. The numbers do not include integrated developments that comprise both malls and offices:In its response to TODAY, CICT referred TODAY to its full-year results announcement released last Wednesday, which showed that its 2022 tenants sales per sq ft rose by 22 per cent.When comparing the Year 1 rent of the new leases with the outgoing final rents of expired leases, rent reversion a metric to show whether new leases signed have higher or lower rental rates than before was negative 1.5 per cent.Further, the tenant retention rate for CICTs shopping malls was close to 90 per cent, meaning about nine out of 10 tenants renewed their leases with CICT in 2022.Both MCT and FCT declined to respond to TODAYs queries.The REIT Association of Singapore (REITAS) said that as of Dec 31 last year, there were 42 Singapore REITs and property trusts listed on the Singapore Exchange, making up a total market capitalisation of S$100 billion or around 12 per cent of the entire Singapore Stock Exchange.For comparison, REITs account for about 6 per cent of the total market capitalisation in Australia, while it is 3 per cent each for the United States and the United Kingdom, and 2 per cent in Japan.A 2022 article by DBS Bank also stated that Singapore REITs are popular among retail investors attracted to income investing because these companies are mandated to distribute at least 90 per cent of their taxable income as dividends.This provides a yield of between 5 and 6 per cent, which some unit-holders might feel provide more attractive returns than government bonds and term deposits.Historically, the bank said that REITs have also performed well in a rising interest rate environment.Aside from REITs, tenants can also choose other types of landlords to lease from, such as developers, small-time owners of strata unit stores as well as property funds.All the same, Professor Sing Tien Foo from the National University of Singapores Business School, where he specialises in real estate research, pointed out that past studies by the Ministry of Trade and Industry have found there is no significant evidence to link higher rents with REIT ownership.PropertyGurus Dr Lee added that because REITs tend to acquire strategically located properties, they can command higher rentals than non-REIT-owned properties.But while tenants have the option of moving out to another location if they feel that rent is too high, Mr Colin Tan, a former research director of a global real estate consultancy firm, said that there is only a limited pool of landlords that they can choose to rent from.This is particularly so if they wish to reap the benefits of being situated in a REIT-owned mall, such as high footfall brought on by promotional activities or a diverse tenant mix, added Prof Sing.As such, the grass may not necessarily be greener on the other side.Said Mr Tan: Because there are so few (REIT landlords) they may all come together to set a certain price that will not rock the boat.Mr Yow said that there is also the option of renting a Housing and Development Board (HDB) shophouse within heartland areas, where the rental pressures are much less, but it may not be feasible for all businesses.For many of us selling anything from mid- to premium-tier brands, we must open up in the right neighbourhood and right brands around us Its about branding. Would Chanel open up a shop in an HDB shop? he said.Though retail rent is flat for now, Mr Tan the property analyst worries that it may rise to a level where it could be unaffordable for all except major brands and chains, and ultimately affect the diversity of offerings available for consumers, which will in turn impact Singapores reputation as a shopping haven for tourists.However, Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty Network, offered a different opinion about why rent will not be unjustifiably raised for tenants.The priority for managers of REITs is to keep occupancy high, as opposed to raising rents to a level that forces tenants to close shop, he said.Unless they are super confident that its a landlords market and they can quickly fill up the vacancy again, they would rather not have a unit empty for too long.You just need to see those malls run by REITs. You seldom see a shop that is empty for too long, Mr Mak said.In any case, Mr Mak said that rent often constitutes between a fifth and a quarter of a tenants business cost, and that there are other challenges that a business will need to overcome to stay in operation.Mr Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small & Medium Enterprises (ASME), pointing to the URA commercial rental trends, added that while it appears that business owners may have had some relief from rental pressures amid the pandemic, business has generally been poor during the crisis.And now coming out of COVID, everybody is facing a substantial inflationary environment, he said.In general, the experts interviewed by TODAY agreed that aside from rising energy costs in part due to an energy crunch protracted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict businesses must also deal with increases in the cost of goods and logistics caused by supply chain disruptions.Yet, what weighs heavily for Mr Wee and other business owners is wages.Last August, TODAY reported that about 46,000 full-time and part-time resident workers would benefit from pay rises of 18 per cent spread over three years starting Sep 1, 2022 for jobs in the lower rungs of the retail industry.Even if the workers are not part of the retail sector, there is also residential rent to consider, especially if they are foreigners.And unlike the commercial sector, the thriving rental market in Singapore continues to grow without any indication of slowing down.Residential property data published by the URA in late January showed an overall increase of nearly 30 per cent last year a 15-year high.And while it may seem like it has no direct impact on businesses, Mr Yow said: Which business does not have foreign workers?Though not all businesses are expected to cover the cost of rent for their workers, Mr Yow said there is an expectation to raise their salaries so their employees could afford it.Ultimately, Mr Yow said all these factors added up have made it a challenge for businesses to chart a course to safe harbour. \"It's just difficult, and we're trying every way and means to figure our way out of this situation,\" he said.This story was originally published in TODAY."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: SRI)SINGAPORE: More homes in Singapore could be up for auction this year as the number of bankruptcy petitions rises, according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank.This comes amid the higher cost of living, rising interest rates and the reduction of pandemic support measures, it said in its latest report on the auctions market on Jan 30.Ministry of Law data shows that 3,648 people filed for bankruptcy last year, 15 per cent higher than the 3,160 applications filed in 2021.There were 420 auction listings in 2022. This number, which includes repeat listings, could surge 40 to 50 per cent to about 600 this year, Knight Frank said in its report.The listings include 184private residential properties put up for auction by owners or banks, as well as 211 commercialunits including retail shops, offices and industrial space. There were also 11 shophouses, 12 Housing Board flats and two properties classified as \"others\".Of these, 40 properties were sold by auction for a total gross sales value of S$90.3 million.Besides more homes being put up for auction, the number of commercial and industrial properties going on the block could also increase. This is as more small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) exit their business amid a gloomy economic outlook, the Knight Frank report said.Another real estate consultancy, Edmund Tie, also expects auction listings to increase but only towards the second half of the year, as banks will take several months to repossess the units.As interest rates continue to rise, those tied to home loans with floating rates will feel the pinch, said Ms Joy Tan, head of auction and sales at Edmund Tie.The three-month compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA), a key benchmark used to price home loans, went up from below 0.2 per cent in January 2022 to more than 3per cent this year.Those who bought their properties during the property boom year of 2021 on two-year fixed rates will be looking forward to refinancing this year, and will also feel the pinch with the new rates, said Ms Tan.But there are also sellers with strong holding power, she said.The healthy rental market helps to alleviate some pressure off the owners, so there is no urgency as of now for the sellers to dispose of their investment residential properties.As of now, the auction market has not seen the full impact of rising interest rates.Banks told CNA that foreclosures have not increased, although more customers are seeking to refinance their home loans for better interest rates.One bank, UOB, said it has not seen a significant increase in customers needing help with their loans. Nor has it seen any \"systemic stress\" in its mortgage portfolio, saidMs Jacquelyn Tan, head of group personal financial services.Maybank also said there has not been a noticeable increase in customers seeking help on their mortgage payments. But more are enquiring about cheaper loan packages with the hike in interest rates, a spokesperson said.Of the 420 auction listings last year, 133 were mortgagee listings, according to the Knight Frank report. Mortgagee sales occur when the owner is unable to pay the loan and the bank forecloses on the property.Ms Mok Sze Sze, managing partner of auctions and sales at Singapore Realtors Inc (SRI), said that many people have the misconception that auctions are for only bank-repossessed properties.But more owners are turning to auctions to sell their properties, she said.One advantage of selling by auction is that it is transparent and aims to achieve an \"optimum price within a set timeframe\", Ms Mok said.Besides homes, a variety of commercial and industrial properties are also put on auction including Housing Board shophouses and JTC factories.When a property is sold at the auction, typically 10 per cent of the sale price is collected as deposit, although for some residential properties, the deposit could be 5 per cent. Buyers sign the contract on the spot and there is no cooling-off period of 14 days.One notable auction sale last year was a repossessed semi-detached houseat Nim Green in Yio Chu Kang that sold last April at S$6.33 million S$500,000 above the opening price after an intense bidding session, said Edmund Tie's Ms Tan.A townhouse unit at 8 Nassim Hill also attracted buyers' attention and was \"knocked down\" at S$9.79 million in February 2022.This was a sheriff's sale, for seized goods and property.Buyers at auctions looking for investments are also turning to commercial properties, as such transactions do notattract ABSD orAdditional Buyer's Stamp Duty, said SRI's Ms Mok.This is a tax for residential properties, first introduced in 2011, to curb a surge in demand for property.The ABSD rate has increased since then over a few rounds of cooling measures, with the last hike in December 2021.As there is no ABSD for commercial or retail properties, these have become more attractive as investments.Some notable commercial transactions in 2022 were two HDB shophouses and a strata shop at ICON@Changi.One of the shophouses, a two-storey corner unit at Ang Mo Kio Central, had an opening bid of S$5.8 million and was sold at S$8.75 million substantially above the opening price.This was after heated bidding by several parties at a Dec 8 auction held by Knight Frank."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: AFP/Roslan RAHMAN)SINGAPORE: A rise in the buyers stamp duty (BSD), announced in the Budget on Tuesday (Feb 14), will affect mainly high-end luxury properties, property agents and analysts said.Property agents said that there were some transactions for properties of higher value that were brought forward but no great rush to beat the tax increase kicking in on Wednesday.Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong announced at around 5pm that the BSD will be going up for transactions of higher-end properties.For homes, the portion of the value in excess of S$1.5 million and up to S$3 million will be taxed at 5 per cent, up from the current rate of 4 per cent.The value of the property in excess of S$3 million will be taxed at 6 per cent.There is a transitional provision, where the current stamp duty rates will apply for cases where the Option to Purchase (OTP) was granted to potential buyers on or before Feb 14.CNA called and/or visited a number of condominium showrooms in Singapore on Tuesday evening after the announcement, but they were either closed or empty.Mr Ken Tay, a property agent at ERA Realty Network, a lot of buyers called him when they first heard the news.\"They panic, they think it's a lot, but actually it's not a lot,\" he said.The increase has a larger impact on clients who are buying property worth S$3 million or more, and he was working on those deals to meet the deadline tonight.Ms Stella Thio, the project lead for eight luxury properties, said that she would be picking up some OTPs for Kilmt Cairnhill to send her clients, but there were fewer than 10.These are homes in the lux segment that are more than S$5 million, she said. The paperwork was already done, so the clients transferred the funds and were expediting.Key executive officer of PLB Realty Kenneth Tan also said theres some activity ahead of the new rates kicking in, and it is likely to be concentrated among higher value transactions of S$4 million to S$5 million.People who have been waiting on the fence might want to take action, he said, adding that there may be some buyers who feel a sense of urgency because they have already sold their properties. Others in the market may remain prudent and hold back.The increase is not too significant, its not like it prices people out, he said.Mr Ismail Gafoor, CEO of PropNex, agreed that there was no rush by home buyers to close transactions.The increase in BSD payable is not excessive and it is not insurmountable for buyers, said Mr Gafoor.Some buyers who are already in negotiation prior to the announcement or those who have already narrowed their property search down to a certain unit will be encouraged to commit within today to avoid the marginal increase in BSD.Calculations from property analysts show that for a S$2 million property, the BSD would rise by S$5,000, while for a S$10 million property, the additional tax would be S$155,000.Huttons senior director of research Lee Sze Teck said: Most HDB upgraders buy below S$2 million and should be able to pay this marginal increase in property tax.Ultimately, the buyers who would be paying a higher amount of BSD are those acquiring properties costing more than S$3 million each, said Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty Network. However, we think that homebuyers in these two markets may not be as sensitive to such additional costs.Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of Research & Analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, agreed that wealthy buyers are not likely to be deterred by the additional BSD.Properties priced at S$3 million and above tend to have unique attributes or those above S$10 million tend to be rare products, which will continue to attract investor interest, she said.Some analysts said that while the BSD increase was minimal, buyers could be deterred following earlier wealth taxes and cooling measures for residential properties, and higher financing costs.Transaction volumes in both residential and non-residential properties could slow down in the near term. Prices could still be resilient given strong fundamentals of the underlying property sectors, said Ms Tricia Song, Head of Research, Southeast Asia, CBRE.Mr Lee added that the change in buyer stamp duty rate may have to do with the increase in property values in the last year and the likely return of foreigners to the Singapore property market.He thinks that this increases the transaction costs for foreigners but does not discourage them from buying residential or commercial properties.The Government has further refined the stamp duty rates to be progressive. The more well-to-do who purchase higher-value properties will pay more taxes. This will help in wealth distribution by using the taxes to help the lower income, said Mr Lee.Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said the additional BSD for a S$10 million property was S$125,000. It should be S$155,000. We are sorry for the error."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Then in December of 2021, we had cooling measures (and) the additional buyer's stamp duty for developers was raised to 40 per cent. That raised the risk for developers significantly, and slowed down the en bloc market in 2022.\"The number of sites that sold successfully fell from 18 in 2021, to 13 last year.Several en bloc properties sat on the market as sellers and buyers failed to agree on pricing, with more than 20 sites remaining unsold among the roughly 30 en bloc sites launched last year.Some residential deals that did not go through include Kensington Park, which was listed for sale at more than S$1 billion dollars, and Loyang Valley, which was priced at S$980 million dollars.Economic uncertainty, higher borrowing costs and further cooling measures that held back activity last year are expected to continue in 2023.Mr Alan Cheong, executive director of Savills Singapore, said: It will be a pretty challenging year in 2023 for the residential (and) collective sales market, for the reason that there's caution in the air due to geopolitical tensions. Also, people (are) expecting the economy to slow down.Developers are also hesitant over a new rule in June to standardise floor area definitions across government agencies, which would mean less space in projects for sale.For collective sales, because the reserve price had been set in a time where this new ruling had not been taken into account, developers will have an issue trying to reconcile the higher reserve price vis-a-vis lower saleable areas that they will be faced with,\" added Mr Cheong.Private home owners may also shy away from en bloc deals, due to a recent requirement to wait 15 months after a sale before they can buy a resale flat.Mr Lee explained that some of these owners want to move to a public housing flat after selling their property.Right now, they are not able to unless they fulfill certain conditions, then they might actually resist the wholesale itself, he said.He added that the increase in additional buyers stamp duty is another thing developers are mindful of, as it would drive up their costs.Such hurdles in the residential market could push developers to explore commercial sites instead, according to analysts.Everything boils down to the price again. If the residential site is reasonably priced, and has the right bite size, meaning they don't go too high in the absolute quantum of investment, developers may still go for residential. But at the moment, it may be the commercial sites that they may be going for, said Mr Cheong, adding that there are few such collective sales sites currently.While Tanglin Shopping Centre was one recent high-profile commercial sale, other sites like International Plaza and People's Park Centre have failed to close.This year, commercial and residential sites up for en bloc include Manhattan House near Chinatown, a commercial property, and condominiums Trendale Tower and Charming Garden Condo in the central region."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(File photo: CNA/Hanidah Amin)SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament voiced concern over soaring property prices, and asked for more support for parents, workers and local companies on the second day of the Budget 2023 debate on Thursday (Feb 23).For close to seven hours, 29 MPs spoke in the House on the Budget delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong last week.Some MPs raised questions about excessive competition and the widening income gap between graduates and non-graduates.Our younger Singaporeans in Institutes of Technical Education who are soon to join the workforce face a daunting challenge. The starting salary gap between university and non-university graduates continues to widen, said Mr Desmond Choo (PAP-Tampines).He suggested strengthening vocational training and apprenticeship programmes for ITE students and graduates, as well as better internship and mentorship opportunities for them.Mr Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) warned against having an unbridled, winner-take-all meritocracy in Singapore, saying: We need a concerted policy effort to improve wages, skills, productivity, working conditions, societal respect in trades jobs.Ms Carrie Tan (PAP-Nee Soon) asked Singaporeans to seriously consider a different model of progress, pointing out that Singapores current economic model fails to account sufficiently for sustainability, and for people's well-being.MPs also voiced concern about the mismatch in demand and supply for homes and surging property prices.We need to keep our property prices in check, said Mr Gan Thiam Poh (PAP-Ang Mo Kio). Will the Government review and consider boosting the supply of public and private housing even more?He was among MPs who asked for the Housing Board to build more homes and he also suggested that the Ministry of National Development considers measures to facilitate the development of more private housing.NCMP Hazel Poa (PSP) reiterated the opposition partys stance on the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Grant for resale flats, asserting that such a grant would lead to an upward spiral in prices for such flats by pushing up demand for resale flats.As land cost is determined based on resale transactions. The increase in resale prices would result in higher land costs. The amount that HDB (Housing and Development Board) pays to SLA (Singapore Land Authority) for land would increase, thereby increasing the cost of new flats.The potential increase in subsidies and grants needed for new flats will require more tax revenue in an unsustainable cycle, noted Ms Poa.The Non-Constituency MP also spoke about how more profitable companies ought to pay more taxes.We should review the tax incentives and treatments given to companies earning profits beyond S$10 million so that they pay more taxes. For example, if companies earning above S$1 billion in profit, pay just 3 per cent of their profits as taxes instead of the current 0.9 per cent, the additional revenue raised will be about S$5 billion per year.The higher corporate tax revenue generated could be used to lower business costs, the cost of living and to offset the higher effective tax rate. Singapore will retain its attractiveness as an investment destination and provide relief to Singaporeans, said Ms Poa.Associate Professor Jamus Lim also appealed for taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to remain low even as the Government implements a global minimum corporate tax rate to comply with an initiative to close gaps in international taxation or the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) framework.Placing the burden of higher corporate taxation on the shoulders of MNCs that are more able to afford it - and who are the primary targets of the agreement in any case - will provide a better business climate for our SMEs to eventually grow and become international companies in their own right, said Assoc Prof Lim.He, along with Mr Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer), called for unemployment insurance for workers who have been made redundant - a policy that both the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Workers Party have championed.Mr Tay, who focused his speech on support for mature professionals, managers and executives, said: PMEs are an increasingly vulnerable group because of rapid economic changes and cycles.The support provides displaced workers the space to upgrade their skills and look out for suitable employment, with the knowledge that they would be able to continue supporting their familys basic needs during this difficult period.A number of MPs asked for more support for SMEs, with Mr Derrick Goh (PAP-Nee Soon) saying: Some local businesses have fed back that Budget 2023 is pro-redistribution and seemingly a shift away from pro-business growth.They wonder if this means that they should fend more for themselves and expect less help going forward.He added that Budget 2023 is being rated by many as an A-grade for families and individuals but SMEs would score the Budget a B or even a C.The MPs asked for help for SMEs to deal with rising costs and to strengthen their capabilities to hire and train workers, and to step up their game in Environment, Social and Governance or ESG.I also urge our government agencies and government-linked companies to support our SMEs by providing more business to them as to benefit almost 70 per cent of the Singaporean workforce indirectly, said Mr Don Wee (PAP-Chua Chu Kang).Mr Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) noted that higher rental costs may affect the competitiveness of SMEs, which may struggle to afford rent. He urged the government to look for ways to moderate industrial and commercial rental costs for SMEs to benefit a broader base of businesses.Several MPs also spoke out for different groups of workers from seniors, lower and middle-income workers, to platform workers and freelancers.Responding to a call by NCMP Leong Mun Wai (PSP) on Wednesday to raise the Local Qualifying Salary (LQS) from S$1,400 to S$1,800, Minister of State in the Prime Ministers Office Desmond Tan said until COVID-19, the LQS was increased S$100 each year from 2017.He added that Singapore needs a sustainable and systematic mechanism to set and review the floor wage.Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman (PAP-Marine Parade) pointed out that the current LQS of S$1,400 is much lower than the wage level of the lowest 20 per cent of wage earners, which was about S$2,800 in 2022.I would like to call on the Government to annually review the LQS to ensure that wages keep pace with wage convergence targets for our lower-wage workers, said Mr Fahmi, who is a director at NTUC.Numerous MPs raised the challenges of childcare and sought stronger support for parents, in particular, unwed mothers.Ms Cheng Li Hui (PAP-Tampines) asked for more childcare facilities in new housing estates for young couples and flexible work arrangements for parents.NMP Abdul Samad asked if the extended childcare leave of two days per year can be extended to parents with children above 12 years old until they complete secondary school.Ms He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang) asked for the enhanced baby bonus and parenthood policies to be extended equally to all parents, including unmarried mothers.Likewise, NMP Shahira Abdullah said that measures should not penalise single mothers. The parenthood tax rebates and Working Mothers Child Relief scheme require the mother to marry the biological father of their child, she said.An ancillary consequence of some of these measures is that a single mother may feel that (she is) penalised so drastically as a single parent in a Singapore system that it is impossible to walk away from a bad or abusive relationship to avail themselves to the budget incentives, she said.Dr Shahira also requested that the additional two weeks of Government-paid paternity leave be started from three weeks in the second half of this year, to the full four weeks from January next year."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Industry expert Ku Swee Yong looks at the issue of stigmatised properties and whether sellers are obliged to disclose the houses history.HDB flats in Singapore. (File photo: TODAY/Ooi Boon Keong)SINGAPORE: A home is the biggest purchase most people are likely to make in their lives. Buyers typically expect hiccups along the way - rusty pipes, renovation delays and noisy new neighbours are annoying, but not at all unexpected. Recently, however, one family had to deal with a morbid surprise. Three weeks after they moved into a resale flat they bought in Potong Pasir, they found out that the previous owner had died in the unit alone, his skeletal remains undiscovered for nine yearsuntil 2020. According to media reports, the new buyer said she was not informed about the flat's history during the transaction process.Are sellers and realtors obliged to disclose a death in a house? How does a death in a home affect the value of the property?Singapore is an ageing nation - by 2030, about one in four Singaporeans will be 65 years old and older. With the country's aim of having more people move towards dying at home and in palliative settings instead of hospitals, the number of cases where people pass away in their homes will increase. This could have an impact on the real estate market, as properties where deaths have occurred may be considered stigmatised and challenging to sell. Stigmatised properties refer to real estate that are associated with an event or events that are considered to be distressing or negative, such as one where an unnatural death, a murder or a suicide, has taken place. These properties may include residential or office units, shophouses, retail shops and factories, and can be difficult to sell or rent because potential buyers or tenants are hesitant to occupy a space where something tragic has happened.While some may be hesitant in considering such properties due to concerns about the potential for paranormal activities, others worry about the effects on their mental health and psychological well-being. Even for investors who do not care about the paranormal nor the impact on mental health, concerns about the future rental income and resale value of properties associated with unfortunate events and lingering negative publicity are real. Despite these concerns, such properties are not unsafe for occupiers to live or work in. Many times, these properties have been cleaned and renovated, and the emotional impact of the event has been addressed. In all likelihood, the event itself could have been a one-time occurrence and not reflective of the overall liveability and desirability of the property. Some people are able to see the upside of such properties, which may garner a good price bargain relative to the location and amenities in the neighbourhood. Still, stigmatised properties often sell and rent for less than similar properties that do not have any negative associations due to relatively lower tenant demand, lower rents and therefore, lower valuation. Buyers who are concerned about unnatural deaths in the properties they are considering can take various precautions.One quick way is by searching the Internet for news articles and public records to see if any murders, suicides, or unnatural deaths have been reported in and around the location. Buyers may also check the property's title to see if previous owners names correspond to obituaries and articles about deaths that have been reported at the address.Most of us might not be comfortable doing this but speaking with residents about whether they enjoy living in that neighbourhood and asking if they know of any deaths that have occurred at the property might reveal nuggets of information not previously available.If the buyer has an agent, the agent could be tasked to ask the tough questions and find out if there have been unnatural deaths in the property by checking with the seller or the sellers agent.It defers from country to country. In Singapore, there is no specific law that requires the disclosure of deaths that have occurred in a property during the buying process. As part of the Code of Ethics and Professional Client Care for real estate agents, if the agents were asked, they are expected to disclose all facts that they know are material to the transaction, including recent death from unnatural causes in the property.In Japan, disclosure about unnatural deaths is mandatory in the property transaction process. Under an Important Matters document, all significant points related to the property are declared by sellers: Infrastructure works, planning permissions, applicable laws, zoning as well as negative events. Buyers need to sign off and acknowledge before they can move on to signing the sales and purchase agreement. Due to the strict disclosure rules, Japanese property agents tend to disclose unnatural deaths when they advertise stigmatised properties for sale or rent. To simplify information search, a Japanese investor created the Oshima Teru website to document stigmatised properties. Initially created for Japan, the website now maps properties around the globe, including Singapore.In the United States, some states have laws that require sellers to disclose information about deaths that have occurred on the property. This information may be included in the property listing, or the seller may be required to disclose it during the early stages of the contracting process, where buyers can still walk away without financial losses.Some states do not have laws requiring sellers to disclose deaths that have occurred in the home, or that declaration is only required if deaths happened within say, three years, of the property being offered for sale. Additionally, some sellers may not disclose this information voluntarily, so it is important for buyers and their agents to research as much as possible and to ask the right questions when before purchasing a property.Much as the cosmetics manufacturers would like us to believe otherwise, ageing is irreversible. Singapore's population is ageing rapidly and along with that, rising numbers of deaths. As a market analyst, I have expressed my concerns around the impact on home prices when the large numbers of baby boomers pass on and their children sell the inherited properties to divide their inheritance as cash. According to SingStats Population 2020 report, there are about 990,000 people aged between 55 and 74 in Singapore.The total number of deaths recorded in Singapore in 2020 was 22,054. In 2021, the number increased by 10 per cent to 24,292.Over the next decade, the large numbers of the baby boomers cohort will increase the number of deaths significantly, many of which may happen at home.Stigmatised properties can be a sensitive subject as they are often associated with tragic events that have a lasting impact on the people involved. For buyers to make well-informed decisions about the properties, it is important that sellers, real estate agents and other parties involved in the transaction have full transparency and disclosure about any deaths that have occurred in the properties.On the flipside, selling the properties could be challenging for those in bereavement and still suffering from their recent loss of family members. Buyers should also be considerate of the privacy of the sellers and show respect for the deceased and their families.Information disclosure should be done in a sensitive and professional manner, with a sharp focus on providing accurate information rather than sensationalising or exploiting the event to drive a hard bargain.The trend of increasing numbers of deaths at home may have an impact on Singapores real estate market. Where stigmatised properties are put up for sale, buyers and agents should display compassion and understanding, respecting the privacy and dignity of the deceased and their families.Ku Swee Yong is a director of real estate consulting firm International Property Advisor Pte Ltd and a researcher with the Singapore University of Social Sciences focused on autonomous vehicles and urban planning."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

We will need to adjust to this new era, reposition our economy and refresh our social compact for the future.In a wide-ranging Budget speech, which was themed \"moving forward in a new era\" and lasted almost two hours, Mr Wong noted how China and the United States are jostling for leadership in key technologies, thereby setting off a trend of greater economic nationalism and protectionism around the world.Governments are increasingly imposing sanctions, investment prohibitions and export controls, as well as implementing aggressive tax breaks and subsidies to anchor strategic industries within their countries, he said.As a result, businesses are reorganising themselves to account for once-unimaginable risks, with more multinational enterprises seeking to relocate to places where they are less likely to get caught in geostrategic crossfires.At the same time, the scope for tax competition is expected to get tougher due to the global Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative, which limits the level of tax incentives that Singapore can use to attract foreign investments.Singapore will need to adapt quickly to these changes, Mr Wong stressed.While countries such as the US are rolling out vast subsidies to build strategic industries, it is not possible for Singapore to outbid these countries to lure multinational firms here, Mr Wong added.Neither can we afford to be complacent and simply take our competitive position for granted. We will therefore have to work harder to enhance our overall productivity and workforce quality to stay competitive in this new environment.To this end, the Government will set aside S$4 billion for the National Productivity Fund, as well as expand the funds scope to cover investment promotion and use it as a way to anchor quality investments in Singapore.A new Enterprise Innovation Scheme will allow businesses to qualify for greater tax deductions of up to 400 per cent for spending on activities related to innovation that include:For now, businesses have tax deductions of up to 250 per cent on some of these activities.Under the new scheme, firms that have yet to turn profitable and so are not able to maximise the benefits of tax deductions may convert 20 per cent of their total qualifying expenditure into a cash payout of up to S$20,000.The Government will also add S$150 million to the SME Co-Investment Fund to invest in promising small- and medium-sized enterprises, and will enhance the Singapore Global Enterprises initiative by S$1 billion.Apart from attracting investments, Mr Wong said Singaporeans should ultimately benefit in the form of wage growth and job opportunities, which is why the Government has invested in SkillsFuture.But more still needs to be done to \"shift our efforts into higher gear\" amid a volatile environment, besides having more skills training that can vary in quality, he added.Hence, there is a need forjobs-skills integrators-intermediaries who work with industry, training and employment facilitation partners. Mr Wong said they will be piloted in the precision engineering, retail and wholesale trade sectors to ensure that training translates to better employment and earnings.Other moves announced for Budget 2023 included:To help Singaporeans cope with inflation and cushion the impact of the rising Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates, Budget 2023 will set aside an additional S$1.6 billion for theAssurance Package, on top of the S$1.4 billion top-up Mr Wong had announced in November 2022, bringing the total package to S$9.6 billion.Among the measures is a one-off Cost-of-Living Special Payment expected to benefit around 2.5 million adult Singaporeans.The Government will also extend the Enterprise Financing Scheme and the Energy Efficiency Grant for another year until March 2024 to support businesses facing tighterfinancial conditions and high energy prices.Calling families the bedrock of Singapores society, Mr Wong said that the Government will do more to support parentswith the costs of raising children, help manage their various commitments, as well as to support their housing aspirations.Referring to the Forward Singapore exercise he launched in 2022, Mr Wong said the engagements have so far turned up several \"pressing issues\".These issues include the long wait times for new flats and rising resale home prices, which Mr Wong said are key concerns for young Singaporeans.\"We also want to help parents better balance their work and family commitments, and look after their children,\" he said.To address this, Mr Wong said the Government will move sooner on specific measures to support young married couples.Forfirst-time applicants of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, the Housing and Development Board will give them further ballot chances for their flat applications:Low-income households as well as seniors will also get targeted support in Budget 2023 through top-ups of S$300 million to the ComCare Endowment Fund, S$500 million to the ElderCare Fund and S$1.5 billion to the MediFund.For lower-income platform workers, the Government will also introduce aCentral Provident Fund (CPF) Transition Supportfor these workers who will see an increase in CPF contribution rates.The Government accepted last November recommendations to gradually alignCPF contribution rates by platform workerswith regular employees over a five-year period.In his Budget 2023 speech, Mr Wong stressed the importance of resilience in a world characterised by uncertainty and volatility.Giving the example of the several hundreds of billions of dollars needed to rebuild Ukraine as a result of the ongoing war, he said that the best safeguard in such crises is still Singapores accumulated past reserves.Related to this, Mr Wong announced changes to the tax system, including higher marginal buyer stamp duty rates forhigher-valuedresidential and non-residential properties.The additional registration fee for vehicles will also be made more progressive tobetterdifferentiatehigh-end cars and luxury cars.Tobacco excise duties across all tobacco products will go up by 15 per cent immediately.For Budget 2023, Mr Wong said that an overall deficit of S$0.4 billion, or 0.1 per cent of the economy, is expected. There is no need for any draw on past reserves in this years Budget.The Contingencies Fund, which was raised in 2020 from S$3 billion to S$16 billion to help Singapore respond quickly to urgent and unforeseen cashflow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, will now be reduced to S$6 billion.Total government expenditure for the year is estimated to hit S$104.15 billion, a slight decrease from the S$106.95 billion Budget in 2022, based on revised figures. Government spending for Budget 2021 was S$98.41 billion.Over the three-year course of the pandemic, Mr Wong said that the Government has drawn around S$40 billion from past reserves, lower than the initial draw of S$52 billion that was approved by President Halimah Yacob.In the 2022 financial year, the Government drew only S$3.1 billion from past reserves, out of the S$6 billion that was originally set aside. \"It reflects our prudent approach in using our reserves - drawing on them judiciously, only when there are compelling reasons to do so,\" Mr Wong said.This story wasoriginally publishedin TODAY."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The House voted against the amendment.Mr Singh said that the Governments policy levers for affordable homes were not limited to cooling measures, but also included building public housing ahead of demand and stepping up private land sales.The Government regularly trots out the HDB housing backlog after the Asian financial crisis as a reason for not wanting to build excessively, said Mr Singh.Should an event like the 1997 financial crisis occur, Mr Singh acknowledged that the downside of building public housing ahead of demand was the excess stock of flats.But in that worst case scenario, the Government could channel the excess stock into the oversubscribed Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme or expand rental options for large, low-income households, he suggested.In response, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said the HDB was overseeing almost 100 Build-To-Order (BTO) projects islandwide, with almost 80,000 flats under construction now.We will press on. This high tempo will continue and by about 2025, we expect to have about 150 BTO projects going on at the same time, said Mr Lee.He also pointed out that HDB was already building aggressively and at large scale, noting that fiscal resources, foreign manpower and construction capacity are not without their limits.Responding to CNA queries last November, HDB said that it is already building ahead of demand or actual bookings, where possible.Mr Singh said that resale prices have risen because the HDB did not build enough BTO flats to meet demand, even though this \"should have been known and calculable notwithstanding COVID-19 related delays\".Earlier in the debate, MP Leon Perera (WP - Aljunied) had also asked how the supply and demand of BTO flats can become mismatched, given that demographic data generally does not see sudden or radical changes, and the Government does not face \"impediments\" in acquiring land for public housing.Mr Lee rebutted that the opposition leader was calling for \"perfect hindsight\". He pointed to concerns about vacant flats raised by the WP in 2019, and a proposal the party made then to reduce the number of new flats built each year to 9,000.Noting that the HDB had built 15,000 new flats in 2019 and 17,000 new flats in 2020, Mr Lee said: \"Had we tapered down our supply to the Workers' Party's levels in 2019 or listened to you and your experts, I think our BTO shortage would be even greater today.\"Responding to Mr Perera, Mr Lee said that the Government has a model taking into account considerations such as marriages, births and deaths in projecting the real demand for flats. However, it is not a \"perfect science\" and cannot account for sudden shocks.Mr Lee pointed out how demand \"vanished\" following the Asian financial crisis, while during another crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, demand went up.Mr Singh also questioned whether a Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) correction direction issued last October suggested that land for public housing can be sold to HDB at a price lower than its market value as established by the chief valuer.He noted the reserve price for sites sold under the Government Land Sales (GLS) and Industrial GLS programmes, which is pegged to 85 per cent of the estimated market value of each site.Mr Singh pointed out that the Government did not automatically rule out bids below this reserve price.I would like to ask the minister how do these exceptions because they are exceptions avoid the often-heard PAP criticism of raiding past reserves, said the WP chief.Mr Lee asked Mr Singh to file a parliamentary question on this issue so it could be properly addressed at a future sitting.Turning to the Governments housing subsidies, Mr Singh said there was limited transparency on these despite their significant fiscal implications.The subsidies represent the loss that the HDB incurs on the HDBs home ownership programme, and the loss is fully funded and made good by the taxpayer, he said.It was important for the Government to give a breakdown of the dollar value of taxpayer subsidies for the home ownership programme, he said.In response, Mr Lee said HDB was the most transparent on its pricing cost compared to any other property developer. He pointed to the information on the range of subsidised BTO prices and comparable resale prices provided at each launch.This difference in prices broadly reflects the extent of the market subsidy, which is real and which buyers can realise when they sell the flat, said Mr Lee.He said that except for flats under the Prime Location Housing scheme, the broad market discount across all projects ... in the same launch is broadly in the same parameter to ensure this equity.But later on when they sell it depends on the resale market, it depends on the condition of the flat, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The update was part of the regular review of the RPA to ensure the land use zones are up to date with the prevailing zoning terminology used by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), said MinLaw and SLA in a joint press release on Wednesday.According to URA's website, mixed commercial and residential developments include a combination of commercial uses and residential flats.As land zoned or developments permitted for mixed useare predominantly for residential use, such developments will now be deemed as residential property and regulated under the RPA, said MinLaw and SLA.\"This is to better reflect the intent of the RPA to safeguard residential land for Singaporeans,\"the authorities added.Foreigners whoplan to purchase or acquire an interest in sites permitted for mixed commercial and residential use will now need to apply for approval under RPA.Foreigners who are existing owners of such land or property are not required to obtain approval under the RPA if they \"intend to retain the property as-is\". However, approval is needed should they wish to retain and redevelop the property, said MinLaw and SLA.Foreigners can be exempted from obtaining approval for such land or property ifthe Option-to-Purchase (OTP) was granted by sellers to potential buyers before Jul 20 this year; this OTP is exercised on or before Aug 9; and this OTP has not been varied on or after Jul 20.The update may be seen as a \"pre-emptive move\" to prevent over-concentration of ownership in a development by a foreigner, said Huttons Asia's senior director for researchLee Sze TeckHe added that if a development is owned around 80 per cent by a foreigner, the person \"can decide what to do with the development including en-bloc\".The change may also create uncertaintyin the investment sales, collective sales and shophouse markets in the interim as market players seek clarity on the new rules, said Mr Lee.For instance,strata sales of commercial units in commercial and residential zoned development, as well as some shophouses in Bugis, may be affected.Mr Lee also noted that most of the residential project launches are on land zoned residential and will notbeaffected."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(File photo: CNA/Hanidah Amin)SINGAPORE: The cautious approach that property developers are taking in their bids for Singapore's land sites appears to be spreading even to the highly sought-after central business district (CBD), home to some of the country's high-end luxury apartments.Market watchers cited recent land tenders in the location, saying the doubling of the additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) for foreign buyers to 60 per cent, as well as the lack of facilities in the area, has caused demand for housing units there to be muted.For instance, the Marina Gardens Lane site, a prime area in the city overlooking Singapore's main attractions, attracted a S$1.034 billion or S$1,402 per square foot per plot ratio bid from a consortium led by Chinese developer Kingsford Huray Development.The price is 42 per cent more than the next highest bid of S$727.04 million from GuocoLand (Singapore).Looking at it per square foot, it is also higher than the last bid for Marina View, another site in the area.One property expert said big players such as GuocoLand and Far East Organization were more cautious when bidding for the site, bidding at less than S$1,000 per square foot.The land price might be in the hundreds of millions of dollars or even close to S$1 billion, said property veteran Nicholas Mak, chief research officer at real estate portal MOGUL.sg.And on top of that, the developer also has to come up with the construction cost and other development costs, financing costs and so on, which might double the overall costs for developing that site.As a result, the number of developers who have pockets deep enough to develop them in the downtown area are actually quite limited.The Marina Gardens Lane site attracted four bids.So some developers may adopt a more wait-and-see attitude, said Mr Mak. They may want to see what other developers are doing first, whether their projects are successfully well taken up before entering the market.Before the recent round of measures to cool Singapore's red-hot property market, foreign buyers took up about 12 per cent of units in the downtown area.But experts are expecting the number to be halved, with the ABSD now doubling to 60 per cent of the purchase price.We think there will be some demand. But there are also challenges because of the ABSD for foreign buyers, higher ABSD rate for property investors, so that could also quell investor's demand, said PropNexs head of research and content Wong Siew Ying.Separately, I think the limited schools in that area may discourage some families from wanting to move there. But having said that, it's still a very new area, so we're not quite sure what are the other developments that are coming up.Despite the government's plan to create a downtown area where people can live, work and play, questions also remain over access to other facilities such as recreational and hawker centres, said observers.That lies the challenge, is there enough infrastructure and facilities to support a whole community including people of various ages, from the very young school going children to the elderly, to live in the CBD? asked Mr Mak.He expects developer demand within the CBD to be subdued for at least the remainder of this year.But should the Marina Gardens Lane site be awarded to the top bid of S$1,402 per square foot, he believes the luxury condominium project could see units sold for at least S$2,680 per square foot."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(File photo: Reuters/Aly Song)SINGAPORE: Default risks are once again flashing in Chinas real estate sector.Country Garden, which was the countrys largest property developer by sales volume before this year, is faltering amid record losses, mountains of debt and missed payments to lenders and workers.This comes two years after similar woes at Chinese property titan China Evergrande, which ignited rare protests in the country by aggrieved home buyers and retail investors.For decades, the property sector served as one of the key growth engines of the Chinese economy, accounting for around a quarter of economic output.Intensifying tremors within the sector have inevitably renewed fears about potential spillover effects on the rest of the countrys economy and beyond.Heres what you need to know:Previously fuelled by economic and population growth, Chinas property sector has in recent years fallen on harder times, partly as the domestic economy slowed and housing demand cooled. These challenges deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic which hurt employment and increased income uncertainties.It was also during this time when the Chinese government moved to rein in the massive debt accrued by the industrys biggest players over the decade-long building boom.In August 2020, Beijing rolled out a three red lines policy, a trio of metrics on debt that developers have to meet if they want to borrow more. These essentially tightened conditions for developers to access credit.Unable to borrow and struggling to sell apartments, developers that had been operating far outside the three red lines were thrust into a severe cash crunch, resulting in unfinished homes and unpaid suppliers and creditors.One of the largest casualties was Evergrande, which was one of Chinas largest developers but has turned into the poster child of its sectors woes after being declared to be in default in late 2021.Following a prolonged debt restructuring, Evergrande the worlds most indebted real estate company with debts of more than US$300 billion filed for protection from creditors in a US bankruptcy court on Aug 17.Beyond Evergrande, the sector has seen a series of developer defaults since 2021. Reports have said the number of defaults comes up to companies accounting for 40 per cent of Chinese home sales, with most being private property developers.This time, it is another property titan Country Garden in the headlines for financial distress.This is noteworthy because, in addition to its size, Country Garden was previously viewed as being in relatively good shape compared to most other private developers, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics.The private developer was included in a government list of high quality developers eligible for funding support from state-owned banks in November last year.Country Gardens problems underscore just how bad financial strains in the property sector have become, as well as the failings of existing policy support measures, Mr Evans-Pritchard wrote in a report dated Aug 16.The developers liquidity stress came to light after it missed two dollar bond coupon payments on Aug 6. It has 30 days to pay up to avoid a default.It is also seeking to get creditor support on Aug 31 to add a 40-day grace period for the maturity of a yuan bond due on Sep 2, and extend repayment by three years.The companys first-half results announced on Aug 30 showed a record net loss of 48.9 billion yuan (US$6.72 billion), up substantially from a 6.7 billion yuan net loss in the second half of 2022 and a 612 million yuan net profit in the first half of 2022.Total liabilities for the January to June period stood at 1.4 trillion yuan.Country Garden said it was deeply remorseful for the record losses and warned of default risks if its financial performance continues to deteriorate.Analysts noted thatthe developer is particularly susceptible to weak demand because it focuses on the lower end of the property market.Shares of Country Garden listed in Hong Kong have plummeted nearly 70 per cent year to date. The counter will be removed from the Hang Seng Index on Sep 4 following the indexs latest quarterly review.Experts said that news of yet another top developer teetering on the brink of a default will be a further blow to market confidence and may exacerbate the downturn in Chinas property sector.Default risk concerns will severely weigh on home buyers confidence that, in turn, affect sales. This cycle will worsen the liquidity situation of distressed Chinese developers, said Cofaces chief economist for Asia-Pacific Bernard Aw.While the risk of a default by Country Garden is rising especially amid weak sales, Mr Aw reckoned that the contagion impact would be smaller than Evergrandes partly due to the size of liabilities.Country Gardens total liabilities of 1.4 trillion yuan are only 59 per cent as big as those at Evergrande.The property sector has also gone through a wrenching adjustment and its problems are now widely known versus before, noted Mr Evans-Pritchard.So, the impact of Country Gardens woes is unlikely to be as severe as the fallout from Evergrandes default two years ago, he said.That said, there are concerns about whether the sectors worsening woes will hurt the broader Chinese economy, whose post-pandemic bounce is quickly fizzling out.Although the direct fallout from Country Garden is likely to be more modest than Evergrande, it comes at a more inopportune time when the wider economy is much weaker and the balance sheets of corporates and financial institutions are in worse shape, said Mr Evans-Pritchard.As such, a hit to growth that would normally be manageable risks tipping the economy into a vicious cycle between falling output, deleveraging and deflation.Mr Chen Jingwei, chief investment strategist of Wrise Wealth Management Singapore, said: A slowdown in (China's property) sector could impact overall growth and significantly affect the adjacent construction industry.Other sectors like finance, manufacturing, and local governments which often rely on land sales to finance public projects may also experience repercussions.Already, there are signs of troubles emerging elsewhere.Chinese trust firm Zhongrong International Trust, which has sizable real estate exposure, missed payments on dozens of investment products since the end of July. The firms second-biggest shareholder Zhongzhi Enterprise Group has said it is facing a liquidity crisis and will restructure debt.Thats something that will weigh further on sentiment and will keep (economic) activity pretty depressed in the near term, said Mr Evans-Pritchard.Despite the risks, experts are generally still expecting China to meet its growth target of around 5 per cent for 2023.More stimulus to support growth could be on the cards, although experts such as Mr Evans-Pritchard reckoned that would unlikely be in the form of a direct bailout of distressed developers with authorities keen to avoid moral hazard.Should stimulus steps be taken, these would come in the form of increased fiscal spending to fund big-ticket infrastructure projects, or additional support for consumers and private firms, experts added.Already, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two of Chinas biggest cities, have eased mortgage curbs this week.Overall, the outlook ahead for China may be pretty weak but its not necessarily catastrophic for the world, said Capital Economics group chief economist Neil Shearing.We are not describing a complete collapse in the Chinese economy. Its low but still positive growth, so we dont think that it will derail economies in the Europe or the United States he said in an Aug 17 online discussion on the risks surrounding Chinas economic outlook.Unless the outlook for China becomes substantially worse, (it is) primarily a China story at this stage.Mr Chen from Wrise Wealth Management Singapore also posited that the impact of a default by Country Garden will be largely contained within the China market.This is somewhat alleviated by Chinas slower-than-expected reopening and reduced global financial exposure to the real estate sector, he told CNA.On that note, experts said that spillover effects into the rest of the Asian economies are not too much of a concern just yet.For Singapore, which has China as one of its top trading partners, any impact from the latters housing crisis is likely to be indirect if growth in China weakens substantially, said Mr Aw of Coface.Likewise, the impact on investors in Singapore will also be an indirect one.Substantial downturn in Chinas property sector could result in a global sell-off, including in Singapore, said Mr Chen.For individual stocks, such as Singapore-listed developers with operations in China, these will largely depend on their exposure and resilience, he added.Singapores banking sector, for one, does not have a large exposure to the overall Chinese property sector, said Mr Aw, citing information provided by local authorities two years ago in response to the debt crisis surrounding Evergrande.A parliamentary reply in 2021 said that the exposure of Singapores banking system to the overall Chinese property sector is not large, with direct exposures to China's property sector making up less than 1 per cent of non-bank loans.Areas where investors might want to exercise some caution include Chinese property shares and listed bond funds who have exposure to Chinese property issuers like Country Garden, said Mr Chen.We anticipate further repayment difficulties in this industry until substantial support and stimulus measures are unveiled by the government, he said.As such, it is prudent for investors to wait for more definitive policy actions that can reinstate market and consumer confidence before re-engaging with such trades in Chinas property sector."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: Singapore Land Authority)SINGAPORE: More state-owned buildings in Singapore will be converted to co-living spaces, to meet the rising demand for such housing here.The awarding of a tender at a heritage shophouse along Hindoo Road is the first of multiple expected to be launched over the next few months, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) said on Wednesday (Aug 16).This is in response to changing lifestyle trends and consumer demands in the housing sector here, it said.On the same day, a state-owned two-storey hostel at 26 Evans Road, near the Botanic Gardens, was also put up for tender. Similar to the Hindoo Road property, the tender offers an upfront tenure of five years, and can later be renewed for four more years.The SLA said it will take into consideration the price, quality and green initiatives proposed.The tender for the new co-living facility along Hindoo Road, located near Little India, was awarded to construction company Eco Energy.Tenants will get their own rooms, along with a communal space to unwind and a shared kitchen.Eco Energys general manager David Tan told CNA: We want to encourage (and) give them (tenants) support to do some farming, because we see that there's an in-built courtyard with access to the sky and daylight.Given the profile of our clients, we believe that maybe growing some garden herbs and cooking classes will be very interesting.The firm is targeting academic staff and well-to-do students of nearby education institutions, added Mr Tan. It will cost at least S$3,500 a month to rent one of the roughly 54 units that will be available.The increasing popularity of co-living spaces follows a growing trend of singles renting their first homes instead of owning them.Professor Sing Tien Foo, Provost's Chair at the Department of Real Estate at the National University of Singapore Business School, said the co-living concept is still quite new in Singapore.It may take a while before its impact on the local property landscape can be felt, he added.I think there's still room for new players and also existing players to expand the supply of these co-living housing options, he said.He expects short to medium-term demand to continue strongly and attract people who seek to live independently, yet have a communal lifestyle.This will appeal particularly to visitors and also the young people, young residents or young couples who actually want to have independent living and while waiting for their permanent housing option, said Prof Sing.One draw of co-living spaces is the affordability compared to renting from private landlords, Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of data analytics at Huttons Group, told CNAs Singapore Tonight on Wednesday.Moreover, when you look at a co-living space, they offer you things like housekeeping on a weekly basis, he said, of the added amenities that such facilities provide.Mr Lee also highlighted the communal element and activities in co-living spaces, which allow tenants to get to know more people.So for this type of experience and the value we get, I think the price that they are charging is actually pretty competitive versus the private market side, he said.Mr Lee said part of the demand for co-living spaces is its flexibility for temporary stays, which appeals to people who are affected by construction delays.They cannot put down an exact date as to when their new homes will be completed, and going into co-living gives them that flexibility to actually extend it by a few months, rather than going into a long-term contract of two years, he said.Another source of demand is more permanent, from locals who are interested in experiencing what it is like living in such an environment. This segment may still buy their own houses eventually, noted Mr Lee.Foreigners working in Singapore, especially those affected by increasing rental prices in the private market, are also likely to look towards co-living spaces as a viable option, he added.Ms Petrina Yuen, a postgraduate student who lives in a co-living space, emphasised that such alternative housing options are necessary to address Singapore's unique housing challenges.This includes policies where people below 35 years old are not eligible to purchase Build-to-Order (BTO) and resale flats, she told CNAs Singapore Tonight on Wednesday.I'm not a student in Singapore, but I think it's really important to address, especially, people in my age group who are maybe at their first jobs or recently graduated. The options in the market are really quite limited, even renting a HDB now is really quite an expensive endeavour, said Ms Yuen.She said that while there are a lot of people who decide to continue living with their parents, that may not be an option for a segment who may have various reasons preventing them from doing so.Location is also another huge factor for people to consider co-living spaces as a lot of the mature estates have been priced out, noted Ms Yuen.A report by real estate consultancy JLL recently showed that many co-living properties are found in the central part of Singapore, which is well connected and offers easy access to amenities, transport links and workplaces.In particular, River Valley, Geylang and Little India are popular due to their proximity to the central business district, and they also feature vibrant local culture, food and entertainment scenes."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: State Property Information Online)SINGAPORE: The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) is studying the feasibility of extending longer en-bloc leasehold periods, such as 30 or 60 years, in state-owned black-and-white estates for private developers.This is so that developers cancome in as the master leaseholder,rejuvenate the entire estate and reap the benefits over the longer lease period, Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong told parliament on Monday (Jul 3).Mr Tong was delivering a ministerial statement in the debate on the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road by Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam and Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan respectively.SLA, which rented out the Ridout Road bungalows, is overseen by the Law Ministry, which is helmed by Mr Shanmugam, and Mr Tong,who is also Minister for Culture, Community and Youth.A report released by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) last week stated that investigations did not find evidence of criminal wrongdoing or preferential treatment given to Mr Shanmugam and Mr Balakrishnan.A separate review by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean also found that the two ministers conducted themselves properly in the rental transactions and took appropriate steps to avoid any conflict of interest.SLA oversees the management of about 2,600 state properties, including about 600black-and-white bungalows. Currently, tenancies of black-and-white properties are granted on two-year or three-year terms, up to a maximum of 3+3+3 years in the first instance.SLA invests a significant amount to upkeep conserved black-and-white properties due to the nature of the conservation requirements, which impose specific restoration guidelines, said Mr Tong.Tenants also need to be prepared to invest capital to upgrade the properties, while accepting that they can only enjoy the benefits for the length of their tenancy.\"This limits the pool of prospective tenants for black-and-whites,\" said Mr Tong. To address this challenge, SLA has been adjusting the structure of tenancies to provide more flexibility.\"In suitable cases, where tenants are prepared to commit larger sums of capital expenditure to enhance the properties, SLA has been prepared to grant tenancies of 5+4 years,\" he said, adding that thisgives them more lead time in the initial tenancy to recover their capital expenditure.\"This ties in with the larger goal of maximising occupancy whilst ensuring that tenants are able to keep up and maintain the properties, and where possible, also enhance and add to the property through the tenants' capital expenditure.\"Mr Tong said these were among the various measures SLA was taking to \"maximise opportunities for the state to benefit from these properties\".Mr Tong also outlined SLA's policy objectives and process of renting out the black-and-white bungalows, and whether the rentals of 26 and 31 Ridout Road to the two ministers deviated from the usual process.The bungalows at 26 and 31 Ridout Road, built in the early 1900s, were gazetted as conservation properties in 1992. This status imposes obligations on the property owner, such as respecting the key elements of the properties.Mr Tong said that a \"judicious balance\"is necessary between protecting heritage properties and redeveloping them altogether. Some black-and-white bungalows have been repurposed, such as 5 Gallop Road into the Forest Discovery Centre at the Singapore Botanic Gardens' Gallop Extension.\"If the black-and-whites are located amidst or amongst a landed enclave, such as in Ridout Road or perhaps Nassim Road, an area that is zoned for landed properties, removing the black-and-whites or redeveloping them and the land around it would not change the area much,\" he said.\"The cleared land can only then be similarly used for low intensity development. It would not be possible to put the site to other uses,\" he said, adding that these include commercial and social uses.Development plans for black-and-white bungalows are hence driven by master-planning considerations, taking into account each property's specific circumstances such as heritage value, location and possible uses, and being sensitive to the surrounding area, he said.Turning to the rental process for 26 and 31 Ridout Road, Mr Tong reiterated the findings of the CPIB investigation and Mr Teo's review.\"There was every reasonable, commercial basis for SLA to have entered into those transactions. The terms of both leases were standard and did not contain any unusual clauses. They were entirely at arms-length, and did not deviate from usual processes,\" he said.Both properties were managed by the same managing agent - DTZ Facilities & Engineering up to Mar 31, 2018, and Colliers International Consultancy & Valuation from Apr 1, 2018.SLA and the managing agents had the discretion to decide how to market the properties, and listed only 31 Ridout Road on the State Property Information Online (SPIO) portal.As the market revived, SLA in August 2022 required all residential state properties available for rent to be listed on SPIO.The lease for 26 Ridout Road was signed by Mr Shanmugam's wife in June 2018, after the property had been vacant for more than four years. The monthly rent was S$26,500 (US$19,590) with a tenancy of 3+3+3 years.The lease for 31 Ridout Road was signed by Dr Balakrishnan's wife in October 2019, after having been vacant for more than six years. The monthly rent was S$19,000 with a tenancy of 3+2+2 years.Describing the usual valuation process, Mr Tong said the \"independent\" SLA valuation team will assess the market value of a black-and-white property and give the leasing division a baseline that must be achieved.\"They, meaning the SLA valuation team, do not know the identities of the prospective tenants or the actual rents eventually negotiated by the parties,\" he said.Responding to a question by Progress Singapore Party (PSP) Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Hazel Poa, Mr Tong said that SLA knew the identity of the prospective tenant of 26 Ridout Road, as it has to know this to process and assess the tenancy bid.But the SLA valuation department and SLA valuer who assessed the guide rent did not know the prospective tenant was Mr Shanmugam, he stressed.\"As CPIB has established, the valuer did not even know that Minister Shanmugam and SLA had settled on a rent of S$26,500 per month. She had assessed the guide rent not knowing the identity of the prospective tenant ... or what was the rent he had already agreed to pay,\" he said.The valuation was done using an \"accepted industry methodology\" of direct comparison with the rent of a comparable property, he added.Responding to another question by PSP NCMP Leong Mun Wai, Mr Tong said the question of whether the President's agreement is required when not awarding state properties to the highest bidder does not arise in the rental of state properties.\"For state land and state properties, the President's agreement is required if such land or properties are to be disposed of below fair market value such that there would be a draw on past reserves. The grant of tenancies of state properties by SLA is not a disposal of state properties,\" he said.Ms Poa and Mr Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) also asked about trees within the two Ridout Road properties that were felled.Mr Tong said that both properties are located within the Tree Conservation Area, where any tree measuring more than 1m in girth requires the National Parks Board's (NParks) approval to be felled.At 26 Ridout Road, after the tenancy started, 19 trees with a girth of more than 1m were felled. Of these, 18 were removed after receiving independent arborist reports and NParks site visits, while one was removed with NParks' approval after failing in bad weather.Decayed buttress roots, structural defects, termite infestations, poor structural form and vigour, or severe leaning resulting in high potential for failure were found in the felled trees.At 31 Ridout Road, before the tenancy started, 24 trees with girth of more than 1m were removed with NParks' approval after independent arborist assessment showed they were at risk of failure and posed safety concerns."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(AFP/Roslan Rahman)SINGAPORE: A Bill to make it mandatory for retail lease contracts to comply with a code of conduct was tabled in parliament on Tuesday (Jul 4).The code sets out guidelines and principles to enable fairer and more balanced lease negotiations between the landlords and tenants of retail premises, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in a press release.These principles range from landlords not being allowed to mark up electricity rates to not requiring a security deposit that exceeds three months' rent if the tenanted floor area is below 5,000 sq ft and the lease term is three years or less. Landlords also cannot terminate leases early citing redevelopment works, unless they meet certain conditions, such as giving tenants a notice period of at least six months.The code also sets out a dispute resolution process for both parties.According to MTI,the code gives landlords clarityon the terms in the lease agreements and makes the negotiation process easier. At the same time, it addresses the key concerns of tenants through the leasing principles.All government landlords and at least nine major private sector landlords, including CapitaLand Group and Frasers Property Singapore, have voluntarily adopted the code of conduct since June 2021.Members of the public were invited to provide feedback on key provisions of the proposed legislation during a public consultation last year from Jul 18 to Aug 5.The proposed Bill will make compliance with the code mandatory for all qualifying retail leases in Singapore.If passed, the legislation is expected to take effect about six months later.This means the code will apply to all retail leases with a tenure of one year or more, signed or renewed from the date of commencement of the legislation, said MTI.The code allows landlords and tenants to deviate from four of the 11 leasing principles by mutual agreement, to allow for \"market flexibility\", the ministry said.The four principles include the exclusion clause, which cannot be in the lease agreement unless both parties agree to it.Clauses on sales performance where landlords can end a lease if certain sales targets are not met can also be deviated bymutual agreement.Landlords and tenants can also agree to alternative security deposit amounts for leases of up to three years and units of up to 5,000 sq ft.Both parties may also agree to a rental formula that changes during a lease, unlike the single rental formula as listed in the code of conduct.A declaration of permitted deviation must be submitted to the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee the custodian of the code of conduct within 14 days of the signing of the lease.With the exception of rental formula, the other deviations will be void if declaration is not submitted within the 14-day period.A dispute resolution process will also be established for landlords and tenants. The process will be affordable and expedient, an MTI spokesperson said in response to media queries.Parties may be required to undergo mediation to resolve a complaint in a dispute. If mediation does not result in an agreed outcome, the party that filed the complaint may apply for an adjudicator to be appointed to decide the dispute.The adjudicators decision may be enforced as a court order.The proposed legislation will also empower the Minister for Trade and Industry to appoint the chairperson and members of the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee, which will continue to be represented by landlords, tenants and industry experts.The committee will review and update the code and establish the process to ensure landlords and tenants comply with the code.Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling said on Tuesday the proposed Bill will help ensure fair and balanced lease negotiations between landlords and retail tenants.Stronger landlord-tenant relationships and understanding will fortify our retail, lifestyle and F&B enterprises and help them weather the future better. This will benefit the retail sector and in the long run, enhance the interest of consumers, she said.Representatives from the industry have also shown support for the Bill, MTI said.Fair Tenancy Industry Committeechairman Max Loh said the committee will ensure the industry \"upholds the spirit of the code\" during lease negotiations."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Image: Screengrab from Google Maps)SINGAPORE: Far East Shopping Centre in Orchard Road has been put up for collective sale, with a guide price of S$928 million (US$697 million), real estate services and investment firm CBRE said on Monday (Jul 24).The 36,014 sq ft corner site, located at the junction of Orchard Road and Angullia Park, has a land tenure of 999 years with effect from 1871. It is currently zoned for commercial use and has a dual road frontage of about 130m.According to Far East Organization's website, the existing building consists of a two-storey basement, mainly used for car parks, a five-storey podium for retail outlets and a 10-storey block for offices. Under the 2019 Master Plan, the site, which is about 200m from Orchard Road MRT station, has an allowable gross plot ratio of 4.9, with a verified existing gross floor area (GFA) of about 242,145 sq ft, equivalent to a plot of 6.72.The site is eligible to participate in the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) scheme, which aims to encourage redevelopment of older buildings in the area to create a new, exciting destination in this part of Orchard Road, CBRE said.Should the respective owners meet URA's redevelopment conditions, the owner(s) may be able to enjoy a maximum increase of 20 per cent in gross floor area, it added.If awarded the SDI, the maximum buildable GFA of 545 Orchard Road can potentially go up to approximately 290,574 sq ft, which is equivalent to a plot ratio of 8.06.According to CBREs head of Singapore capital markets Michael Tay, Far East Shopping Centre is the only commercial site currently available for sale along Orchard Road.He added that the siteis \"strategically positioned\" to be part of the governments plan, with the SDI scheme meant to \"expedite the rejuvenation of Orchard Road\".\"We believe this opportunity will appeal to both local and foreign developers as the incoming buyer has the flexibility to create an iconic mixed-use development in the most prominent street in Singapore.\"Mr Tay added the SDI scheme proposes implementation of direct underground pedestrian links from the existing Orchard MRT Station and Thomson-East Coast Line Orchard MRT Station to the new integrated development. This will greatly enhance foot traffic to this part of Orchard Road. Developer(s) of the integrated development can also explore a combination of different land uses such as retail, hotel, office, MICE facilities and lifestyle uses under the said scheme.\"The S$928 million guide price is based on a maximum buildable GFA of 290,574 sq ft under the SDI scheme. Assuming full commercial usage, this works out to be S$3,421 sq ft per plot ratio, inclusive of Land Betterment Charge.As the site is currently zoned for commercial use, the successful bidder will not have to pay any additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD).Under the SDI scheme, the incoming buyer is also required to engage in a joint integrated redevelopment with its adjacent sites.Far East Shopping Centre sits adjacent to a hotel, Voco Orchard, and Liat Towers, another shopping mall and mixed-commercial building. It is also known for Shashlik Restaurant, which serves Russian cuisine with a Hainanese spin.The public tender for the site will close on Sep 20 at 3pm."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

CNA speaks to real estate agents and analysts about their due diligence measures and what they look out for.SINGAPORE: Real estate agents are required to conduct due diligence checks on their clients to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, according to the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) and industry insiders.The measures involve a due diligence checklist and a list of \"suspicious indicators\" that includes client behaviour. Clients' details are also checked against international databases, including leaked documents like the Panama Papers.CNA spoke to property agents and analysts after 10 foreign nationals were arrested on suspicion of forgery and money laundering last week. About S$1 billion (US$736 million) in assets has been seized or frozen.A total of 105 properties valued at around S$831 million including Sentosa Cove bungalows, condominium apartments and commercial spaces have been linked to what has become one of Singapores largest police probes into money laundering and forgery offences.The 10 suspects were identified through extensive investigations that included the analysis of suspicious transaction reports, the police previously said. They have since been charged in court.Real estate, banking and law are among the reporting industries where professionals are required to make suspicious transaction reports if they have reason to suspect a property is linked to criminal activity.Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao reported on Friday that about 60 real estate agents purportedly involved in deals with the 10 suspects were to assist with investigations.In response to CNA's queries, the CEA said that real estate agencies and their agents must conduct customer due diligence before entering any business relationship with them.This includes identifying and verifying the identity of their clients, and assessing the risk of them being involved in money laundering activities.They must keep records of these due diligence measures for at least five years. They are also required by law to report any suspicious transactions or activities to the Commercial Affairs Department.To this end, the CEA said it has circulated a list of \"suspicious indicators\" to the real estate industry.The list includes behavioural indicators, such as the client appearing hesitant or declining to put his name on any document that would connect him with the property.Entering the transaction at a value much higher or lower than the market value of the property is another indicator. So is buying multiple properties in a short time, with seemingly few concerns about location, condition and repair costs.The CEA inspects agencies to check if they comply with these regulations.Failure to do so can result in financial penalties of up to S$200,000 per case for an agency, and up to S$100,000 per case for an agent. An agent's registration can also be suspended or revoked.Property agent Shafik Yusope said that his employer PropNex Realty, Singapore's largest real estate agency requires salespersons to adhere to various measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.For example, they are required to submit multiple forms provided by the CEA to their agencies upon the exercise of an option to purchase.One such form, which serves as a checklist on customer due diligence for sale and purchase transactions, gets salespersons to confirm things such as if their prospective client or beneficial owner:Politically exposed persons are those that have been entrusted with a prominent public function, such as politicians and government officials. Due to their positions and access to sensitive information, they are often susceptible to bribery or corruption.For higher-risk transactions, agents are required to conduct enhanced due diligence measures by seeking further information, including the purpose of the transaction and the source of their clients funds or wealth.They also have to seek approval from their agency to continue with the transaction.These higher-risk areas include complex or unusually large transactions, which could include attempts to disguise the beneficial owner or obscure the multiple intermediaries used.According to the checklist, if a salesperson believes conducting such due diligence measures will tip off their client, they should not pursue them and lodge a suspicious transaction report instead.Agents should also consider lodging a suspicious transaction report if they suspect money laundering or terrorism financing activity, among other things.Property agents now can conduct due diligence checks while on the go using web and mobile applications.Mr Shafik uses the Anti Money-Laundering (AML) web app which was developed by the Singapore Estate Agents Association and KEO Connect, in collaboration with database firm Amicus.Using this, agents can generate a report on a client that they submit to their agencies.PropSage, another app that helps agents to manage their property transactions, has an AML checklist feature as well.Agents simply have to enter their clients names into the system to find out if they are in various databases, such as the Singapore investor alert list, Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, United Nations sanctions lists, United Kingdoms consolidated list of targets, Interpol lists, Politically Exposed Persons lists and others.Agents can also check if their clients have been mentioned in a bad light in media reports, such as if they are a person of interest in commercial crime.Outside of the checklist, one of the red flags that agents look out for is when a buyer requests a \"kickback\" on a property purchase.These happen \"quite often\" in sales of luxury properties to foreign buyers, said Mr Alan Cheong, Savills' executive director of research and consultancy.For example, an agent who brokered a sale is entitled to a 2 per cent commission fee. Butthe buyer asks to keep the agent's commission and offers the agent a smaller \"hard work fee\" of about S$10,000 instead.It is \"very suspicious\" that the buyer is asking for a kickback from the agent instead of requesting a discount upfront from the property developer, said Mr Cheong.This raises questions of whether the buyer is managing the funds himself, or whether the money he is using belongs to someone else, he added.Agents usually look out for things like if their client uses a huge amount of cash, said Mr Shafik. If they run into issues, they will report the matter to their key executive officer and ask for their advice.Key executive officers are responsible for the proper administration and overall management of an agencys business, as well as the supervision of its salespersons.OrangeTee & Tie agent Timothy Chew noted that if they discover irregularities in terms of payment from their client to the seller or landlord, such as a lump sum payment, they are supposed to report these transactions to their agency instead of telling or questioning the client about it.The agency will follow up from there. I have not experienced this so far but I think our agency will contact us to find out more, he added.We do not confront the client as our job is not to investigate or alert the client, but (tell our agency about) these unusual transactions.If there are no issues, agents will indicate as such in their checklist. They will declare they have done their due diligence and observed no unusual practices from their client, added Mr Chew.Savills' Mr Cheong said that suspicious transaction reports run on a parallel track to the due diligence measures. An agent can make a police report about a suspicious transaction at any point in time, even after the deal has gone through.As for requests for kickback arrangements, although these raise suspicions, the dilemma is that \"it's either S$10,000 or nothing\" for the agents, he said.Buyers will take their business elsewhere if agents do not agree, saying that \"if you don't want to do (it), other agents will do it\", he added.Some newer agents are even willing not to earn any money from the kickback arrangement zero commission and no \"hard work fee\" as they want to be recognised as the agency's top performer based on the value of the deal alone, he said.Mr Cheong said that when real estate agents suspect a buyer is not genuine, they can choose to take the \"naive approach\" and stop a deal or make a suspicious transaction report. The alternative is to complete the deal and earn what they can.\"The checks are failing because you want it to fail,\" he said of the due diligence process.\"Human beings are driven by greed, and greed will overcome all forms of propriety.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Whats more, the site has attractive attributes.The development currently comprises a seven-storey podium block and a five-storey annex block, accommodating a total of 425 strata shop and office units as well as a privately held carpark. The total gross floor area of the development is approximately 280,000 sq ft, reflecting a gross plot ratio of 3.223.Under Master Plan 2019, Katong Shopping Centre is zoned for commercial and residential use at a gross plot ratio 3.0. The site can be redeveloped into a landmark integrated development at its existing plot ratio of 3.223, with the option of converting the residential component into serviced apartments, subject to authorities approval.The indicative price of S$638 million works out to S$2,277 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr) based on its existing gross floor area.Ms Swee said: Katong Shopping Centre offers investors a rarely available sizeable site with the coveted freehold tenure for a mixed-use development; whats more in the popular and well-established East Coast vicinity.Based on an average unit size of 100 sq m (or approximately 1,076 sq ft), the new development can accommodate about 156 residential apartments, she said. The retail component can feature up to about 112,000 sq ft in gross floor area.\"The popularity of such mixed-use developments albeit with 99-year leasehold tenure is seen from strong buyers reception to recent project launches, including The Reserve Residences, Lentor Modern, Pasir Ris 8, Canninghill Piers, Midtown Modern and Piccadilly Grand,\" Ms Swee added.Hence, Katong Shopping Centre, the property with its strong site attributes, including the freehold tenure, location in a well-established district, proximity to reputable education institutions and city centre, among others provides developers with the prized opportunity to carve a landmark mixed-use development that can cater to todays modern lifestyle, she said.Edmund Tie also pointed out that the shopping centre has a wide catchment of more than 6,000 private housing units within a 500m radius from the site. And thiscatchment will further expand with the upcoming completion of several new projects in the area, such as Tembusu Grand, The Continuum and Grand Dunman.It also highlighted the upcoming Marine Parade MRT station on the Thomson-East Coast Line, which will be operational next year and is located 500m from the site.Interested parties may submit their offer by 3pm on Aug 14."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Image: Altura)SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes in August were driven by an executive condominium (EC) project in Bukit Batok amid a dip in sales due to the lack of new launches and the lunar seventh month.Altura at Bukit Batok West Avenue 8 the first EC launch in the area in more than 20 yearssold 225 out of 360 units, or 62.5 per cent of the entire project during its launch month in August.The last project launch in Bukit Batok, The Dew, was in May 2001.The project also happens to be the first and only EC launched this year.There had not been an EC in Bukit Batok for 22 years and many buyers were looking forward to it, said Huttons Asia senior director Lee Sze Teck.Buyers appreciate the quality finishes and facilities in Altura which are comparable to private residential homes but at a more affordable price.OrangeTee&Tie's senior vice presidentof research and analyticsChristine Sun echoed the sentiment that the project was well received as it was the area's first new EC project in two decades.\"ECs remain popular for their affordability and investment value,\" she noted.EC demand remains resilient, translating to a strong take-up rate during launch weekends despite higher prices, saidEugene Lim, key executive officer of ERA Realty Network.For instance,Copen Grand and Tenet, launched in 2022, arecompletely sold and there are no other EC launches expected for the rest of the year, he added.The new private homes market was muted in August after a \"blistering month of July\", said Mr Lee.According to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), excluding ECs, units sold fell by 72.1 per cent from more than a one-year high of 1,412 units in July to 394 units in August.The figure was also a 10 per cent decrease from the 438 units sold in the same month last year.New home sales dipped in August as there were no major project launches, said Ms Sun.Although five new projects, including the Bukit Batok EC, were launched for sale, none had more than 500 units, she added.Besides Altura, the four other project launches were The LakeGarden Residences, The Arden, Orchard Sophia and TMW Maxwell.Some buyers stayed on the sidelines as the lunar seventh month startedin mid-August, which is \"deemed an inauspicious period for purchasing big-ticket items\", said Ms Sun.Mr Lee also said that the lunar seven month \"played a role in the quieter market in August\" as some buyers may push back their buying decision until the period is over.He noted that the project launches only took place in the first half of August with no launches in the second half of the month.This led to 590 units being launched in August, excluding ECs, which is 72.6 per cent lower than July but 340.3 per cent higher than a year ago, he said, adding that there was no launch during the lunar seventh month in 2022 which spanned almost the entire month of August.Comparatively, the number of transactions for new launches between January to August is only 5.8 per cent lower than that of the same period last year, Mr Lim said, adding that this indicates \"resilient new sale demand\".\"Well-located projects continue to see demand from buyers looking for homes,\" he said.\"But notably, there are emerging signs of buyers fatigue in the face of the higher number of project launches in recent months. The number of new sale units launched in the first eight months of 2023 has more than doubled (117.6 per cent) compared to the same period last year.\"Ms Sun noted that some projects are slated for launch after the lunar seventh month, which may include the luxury project, Marina View Residences and the suburban project, Hillock Green.A high-profile project, Jden, may be also launched by the end of this year. Jden is a mixed-use development by CapitaLand located at the former Jcube.As the project is situated right at the heart of Jurong Lake District, which is the biggest commercial hub outside the Central Business District, the project is expected to draw strong buyer interest owing to its excellent investment potential, she said.Some 13 projects totalling around 3,650 units are expected to launchacross Singapore from September till the end of 2023, offering buyers more new choices, Mr Lim said.Major projects with more than 400 units that are set to launch include Marina View Residences, Hillock Greenand Sora, he added.Developer sales could end the year between 7,000 and 8,000 units with up to 10 new launches in the pipeline from October, said Mr Lee, adding that it will still be\"higher than 2022's 7,099 units despite the economic uncertainties\".More than 5,200 units are estimated to have been sold in the first eight months of 2023, Mr Lee noted.Prices of new homes are likely to trend higher in 2023 on the back of imported inflation and high interest rates."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Landlords also cannot terminate leases early citing redevelopment works unless they meet certain conditions, such as giving tenants at least six months notice.The code will apply to all retail leases with tenures of at least one year. Eateries, tuition centres and gyms are among the types of businesses covered. Businesses in shopping malls will generally be covered.Deviations from some leasing principles will be allowed if both landlord and tenant agree.The Bill also establishes a dispute mechanism. If the code is not complied with and mediation fails, landlords and tenants can be ordered to vary the lease agreement or pay compensation.The code will be administered by the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee (FTIC) and evolve based on industry feedback, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling said.All government landlords and nine major private sector landlords, including CapitaLand Group and Frasers Property Singapore, have voluntarily adopted the code of conduct since June 2021.The COVID-19 pandemic saw rising tensions between tenants and landlords. With the code of conduct, tenants and landlords will have greater clarity on industry norms for key terms in retail lease agreements.This makes the negotiation process more transparent for both parties and addresses the tenants concerns over imbalances in bargaining power, said Ms Low.Additionally, the code also supports a vibrant and healthy lifestyle sector and contributes to Singapores tourism industry.The retail sector makes up more than 4 per cent of Singapores total workforce, hiring 160,000 people. The food services and accommodation sectors employ about 7 per cent of the total workforce, or more than 260,000 workers.Landlords and tenants of retail spaces must follow a code of conduct for lease contracts from next February, after parliament passed a new Bill on Thursday (Aug 3). Heidi Ng with more.Members of Parliament (MPs) welcomed the move to address the power imbalance between tenants and landlords, but raised further concerns and made some suggestions:Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai, who supported the Bill, called on the government to outlaw unfair rental structures. He pointed to landlords who enjoy a cut of the tenants gross sales during good times, and are protected by the base rent even during bad times.On the other hand, MP Lim Biow Chuan (PAP-Mountbatten) expressed caution in asking parliament to legislate on matters which ought to be determined by market forces.He also highlighted the risk of the recommendations in the code tilting too much towards protecting the tenants, should the FTIC have more members who are pro-tenants.MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) asked for the governments position on power imbalances in other contracts involving small businesses, such as with telcos and utility services providers.Closing the debate, Ms Low said that the government has not shifted its position on free market principles, and that the Bill aims to make Singapores retail scene more competitive.She informed MPs that data transparency as well as confidentiality will be mandated as leasing principles in the code of conduct.On the risk of representation tilting towards either tenants or landlords, Ms Low pointed out efforts to balance the needs of both parties large and small in developing the code.The Bill requires the FTIC members to represent the interests of both tenants and landlords, and to seek approval from the Minister for Trade and Industry before amending the code.She added that other feedback by the MPs would be conveyed to the FTIC for consideration."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

For example, they can recuse themselves from overseeing or processing the transaction.These properties will include commercial and residential state properties such as black-and-white bungalows, terraces, factory or office spaces, business parks, shops in neighbourhood centres, hawker and market stalls, said Mr Teo.The Prime Minister will review the declarations required for property transactions for ministers and Members of Parliament from the Peoples Action Party.In May, it came to light that Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam and Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had rented the black-and-white bungalows at 26 and 31 Ridout Road respectively.Interest in the matter arose after opposition politician and Reform Party chief Kenneth Jeyaretnam questioned if the ministers were \"paying less than the fair market value\".SLA, which rented out the Ridout Road state properties, is overseen by the Law Ministry, which is helmed by Mr Shanmugam and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong.On May 23, Mr Shanmugam and Dr Balakrishnan called for an independent review. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also called on the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) to investigate the matter.Investigations by the CPIB did not find evidence of criminal wrongdoing or preferential treatment given to Mr Shanmugam and Dr Balakrishnan, it said in a report on Jun 28.There was also no disclosure of privileged information in the process of the rental transactions, and no evidence to suggest any abuse of position by the ministers for personal gain, said CPIB in the report.In his ministerial statement in parliament on Monday, Mr Teo stressed the significance of Mr Lees request for CPIBs involvement, since the agency reports directly to the Prime Minister, and can even go directly to the President if they are stopped by the Prime Minister from investigating a possible crime.Officers in government ministries and statutory boards with access to privileged information and influence on decisions will soon have to make a declaration before they can rent government properties managed by their agencies. Heidi Ng reports.There is no more thorough, persistent, and I dare say even fearsome investigative body in Singapore, said Mr Teo.That the Prime Minister did not hesitate to call the CPIB in to investigate two senior ministers is a signal how seriously we take such matters of incorruptibility, and its absolute value in our system.Mr Teo said again on Monday that both ministers, as well as the public officers and private sector intermediaries involved, had conducted themselves properly in the rental transactions and that there was no abuse of power or conflict of interest resulting in the ministers gaining any unfair advantage or privileges.The process of renting out the two properties did not deviate from the prevailing SLA guidelines and approaches in renting out black-and-white bungalows for residential purposes, he added.In particular, the guide rents were not revealed to Mr Shanmugam and his agent nor to Dr and Mrs Balakrishnan, Mr Teo noted.The guide rent is the reserve rental based on market rates as determined by qualified valuers, SLA told CNA previously.The SLA valuer who reviewed the guide rent of 26 Ridout Road after the plot was enlarged did not knowthe identity of the prospective tenant, and only learnt that the tenant was Mr Shanmugam after the matter was reported in the media, said Mr Teo on Monday.They also did not know about the rental amount that SLA's leasing division had negotiated with the tenant, he added.The Senior Minister noted that Mr Shanmugam initially offered a rental of S$25,000 (US$18,480) a month, based on his property agent's advice.Mr Shanmugam also instructed the agent that he should not be paying less than his neighbours.A neighbouring unit was tenanted at S$26,000.SLA proposed a rental of S$26,500, and Mr Shanmugam agreed to this, said Mr Teo.\"This episode demonstrates the paramount importance of maintaining high standards of integrity and accountability in the government and nationally,\" said the Senior Minister.In his ministerial statement, Mr Teo also addressed his involvement in the matter.There would have been an actual conflict of interest if Mr Shanmugam made decisions that affect his rental of 26 Ridout Road, since the Law Ministry oversees SLA, reiterated Mr Teo on Monday.But in Mr Shanmugams case, the Law and Home Affairs Minister had informed the then-deputy secretary of the Ministry of Law that he would recuse himself from any discussion related to the rental of the property.He also instructed the then-deputy secretary to approach then-Senior Minister of State for Law Indranee Rajah if any matter related to the property had to be referred to the minister. Mr Shanmugam then informed Mr Teo that if the matter had to go beyond Ms Indranee, she would approach Mr Teo.SLA said earlier in May that Mr Shanmugam had notified a senior Cabinet colleague that he was making a bid for the property.In the end, there was no matter raised by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to the Law Ministry during the entire rental process, said CPIB in its report.Mr Teo noted again on Monday that Mr Shanmugam had recognised the potential conflict of interest, declared it to himself, and took effective steps to eliminate the potential conflict of interest.I wish also to state that as no matters were raised to me regarding any aspect of the rental transaction, I am not an involved party in the rental process, he added.The Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) has agreed with CPIB's findings and recommendations, the latter said in its report last week.AGC has directed that no further action be taken because \"the facts do not disclose any offence\", the report added. \"The investigation into this matter is closed.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

At the broad base, the public housing market is stable with about 25,000 transactions in a typical year, said PropNex Realtys chief executive Ismail Gafoor. However, the new classification of flats into Standard, Plus and Prime categories may have an impact on mobility.With a minimum occupation period of 10 years for Plus and Prime flats, and a four to five-year construction timeline, buyers can expect to be tied down to the property for at least 14 to 15 years, which may affect their subsequent movement up the property ladder. Buyers will need to take a long-term approach to planning, added Gafoor.Despite some moderation and deceleration seen in the housing market in 2023, the governments regulations have helped to provide support for general market growth, OrangeTee Groups chief executive Justin Quek said.Prices are still trending up, with fresh supply limited by fewer new private residential launches last year and overall sales volume declining, Quek noted.Gafoor and Quek were speaking at a property seminar organised by BT on Saturday (Feb 24), titled Unlocking Real Estate Opportunities in the Year of the Dragon, along with Alan Cheong, executive director for research and consultancy at Savills Singapore.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.BT senior correspondent Leslie Yee moderated the discussion.The event had a total of 120 registrations from all backgrounds and ages. Up for discussion were issues such as drivers of the market, the impact of interest rates, investment opportunities in office, retail and industrial segments, and where homebuyers can find value.In the private residential market, Savills Cheong noted that the 2023 story was a tale of two segments new sales versus the resale market. High costs of land and construction are pushing up new launch prices, which in turn keeps the overall price index up, while also holding down sales volume. Meanwhile, any major layoffs in the technology sector may have repercussions on housing demand, he said, and predicted that resale prices may remain flat this year.OrangeTees Quek pointed out that Singapore households have more savings today than they did 10 to 15 years ago, and are also building up equity in their owned homes. An average household equity ratio of 60 per cent debt to 40 per cent equity leaves quite a bit of buffer in the system, he said. Those who lose their jobs may not be forced to let their properties go.Pricing gaps are also popping up, as the market does not move all at once. Areas that were expensive can suddenly look accessible, said Quek.PropNexs Gafoor considered executive condominiums to be good investments for young couples looking to move up the property ladder after getting their first Build-To-Order flat, because of their more affordable per-square-foot price compared to mass market condos.For those with the means and the budget,Gafoor said that a freehold landed property will always be a safeguard against inflation and rising interest rates, due to the scarcity of such properties in the market.Another option for investment is to look at overseas properties, suggested OrangeTees Quek.And certain industrial assets still offer yields that are tenable, said Savills Cheong. Buildings with modern specifications and in good locations will continue to be highly sought after, he explained.In the office segment, strata-titled office units offer potential, Cheong said, as the Urban Redevelopment Authority has put a lid on such space and limited supply may drive up prices and demand.A lot of people are always waiting for the right time to buy. But the right time can be any time. Our property market is moderate and stable, and that is the best time to review your portfolio, said Quek.BT Property Outlook Seminar 2024 is part of BT Clubs lineup of events for the year.

According to Colliers, the large available uncommitted premium space in the market may just drag down rent prices in the near term.Premium and Grade A office rents in Singapores central business district (CBD) continued its decline in the final quarter of 2023, signaling the start of the softer market in the near future.Core CBD Premium & Grade A office rents declined 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter, ending the year at S$11.49 per square feet (sqft), according to a report by professional services and investment management firm Colliers.This drop in rents can be attributed to muted demand as tenants become more conservative in spending and driving space optimisation, Colliers said in its Q4 2023 report on Singapore office rents.As a result, Colliers now expects annual rental growth in the Core CBD Premium and Grade A offices to be slow: as high as just 1% for the whole year, to even having no changes at all (0%).ALSO READ:Private home market to achieve price-supply balance in 2024: analystOffice deal sizes are expected to remain small, with higher interest in strata offices due to their more manageable quantum, and as buyers exhibit prudence with the higher cost of capital and uncertainty, said Catherine He, director, head of Research, Singapore, Colliers.Situation should improve in the second half of the year, when interest rates are expected to recede, she added.Fleeing to the fringesIn 2023, the so-called Premium office segment dragged down rent prices, particularly those at Raffles Place and New Downtown, Colliers noted. Rents for Grade A offices in the CBD, meanwhile, have been supported by demand for smaller spaces and limited supply.Demand seemed to be spilling over to the Fringe CBD and the city fringe, as tenants seek financially attractive options near the CBD, Colliers noted.With the improvement in the transport network, higher rents in the CBD, and quality options further out, more occupiers might also be receptive to take up space in the CBD/City fringe, it added.Shifting power dynamicsColliers advised occupiers to take advantage of the softer markets to secure their ideal space or renegotiate lease terms. Landlords, meanwhile, are advised to focus on securing renewals and be more flexible in rental negotiations.They could also subdivide space to meet the demands of smaller requirements, Colliers said.ALSO READ:Singapores largest S-REITS averaged 5.6% dividend yield in 2023: SGXIn the near term, landlords may find market power shifting away from them at least in the near term, as more options become available to tenants.It is expected that 1.9 million sqft of prime office space will be available in 2024, with around 1.1 million sqft still uncommitted.Meanwhile, as shadow and secondary spaces build up, vacancy and rents may come under further pressure from the increasing amount of available space, Colliers said.Flexible work arrangements will also affect the way employers look at the space they need.The guidelines on flexible work arrangements will become compulsory for employers to follow in 2024.

This, in turn, would lead to a more moderate price growth during the year, Knight Franks research head Leonard Tay said in a commentary.Overall, in 2024, private home prices are projected to grow by a more moderate 3% to 5% in 2024, against the 6.7% (flash estimates) increase in 2023.However, private home prices in the new launch market are expected to remain elevated, driven up by committed land and construction costs. This was also the main element that pushed up prices by 4.2% in the core central region (CCR) in Q4 2023, due to sales from Watten House.High prices for newly launched private homes in the outside central region (OCR) is also expected. For example, non-landed home prices rose 4.6% in Q4 2023, driven up by sales of Jden in Jurong East, which launched in November.This dynamic might result in two-tier pricing with the gap between the primary and secondary market widening in 2024, Tay warned.ALSO READ:Stricter homebuying rules to prop up HDB resale market in 2024: expertsMeanwhile, inventory of landed homes will continue to remain limited. Evergreen demand for freehold landed homes is expected to remain in 2024, with Tay noting that Singaporean homebuyers are willing to move out of familiar locations for a chance to live in a landed property.In Q4 2023, landed home prices rose 4.5%, reversing the 3.6% price decrease in Q3 2023. This translated to an increase of 7.8% for the whole of 2023.General demand for private homes in the months ahead will remain underpinned mostly by homebuyers purchasing for their own occupation, even as these buyers take a longer time to consider in light of factors such as cooling measures, sticky high interest rates, job security, inflationary and recessionary pressures, Tay said.Although household balance sheets are healthy, homebuyers have been and will continue to be circumspect in their housing decisions, targeting locational and product attributes that best fit their lifestyle and family requirements, such as schools, he added.ALSO READ:Higher rental occupancy cap to provide short-term fix to Singapores supply woes, says expertsMeanwhile, residential investors purchasing for capital preservation, appreciation, and recurring income, both locals and foreigners, will likely remain on the sidelines until interest rates peak, stabilise, and perhaps reduce, Tay noted.Nonetheless, history has shown that experienced investors familiar with Singapores private residential scene are quick to react when windows of subdued activity turn with the return of transactional activity, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

People, especially the 20s, cannot afford to buy a house or an apartment anymore. We're trying to solve the affordability crisis, where people will need to actually have now more rent, smaller spaces and more customised to their needs, because potentially they only need room.In addition, Castagne shared that renting an apartment takes a lot of time and effort.

This is the fifth consecutive year that the headline CPI has failed to go over 1% YoY, according to OCBC Treasury Research.Slowing gains in raw food prices, relatively subdued healthcare costs and negative contributions from imputed rentals are main reasons for this structural change that has been observed in the past half-decade, said Howie Lee, economist for global treasury at OCBC Bank.Core inflation also rose 1.0% YoY the lower end of MAS comfort range of 1-2% and the slowest since 2016. Deflationary pressures from the utility basket due to the Open Electricity Market (-1.3% YoY) and relatively benign gains in the healthcare (1.1% YoY) and raw food (1.1% YoY) baskets contributed to the soft showing in core inflation this year, Lee said.For December 2019, headline inflation accelerated for the second straight month to 0.8%. Core inflation inched up to 0.7%, the fastest pace since September.According to UOB economist Barnabas Gan, higher-than-expected inflation print was driven by price increases in private road transport, services and food. Private road transport rose by 3.1% YoY, extending the nine months streak of gains since April 2019. This is due to higher Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums (+21.9% YoY) and Brent crude oil (+21.9% YoY) prices in December. Services inflation also increased by 1.3% YoY, on the back of higher fees in telecommunication services, education services and airfares.For 2020, OCBCs Lee expects deflationary pressures from imputed rentals to continue normalising towards the neutral territory. Additionally, consumer savings from the OEM are likely to have already been largely factored in last year, whilst the start of 2020 suggests higher oil price volatility as a result of Middle East unrests could be a common feature, he said.External sources of inflation are also expected to stay benign in the quarters ahead amidst weak demand conditions, said UOBs Gan. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) also kept its dovish rhetoric surrounding Singapores labour market conditions, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Demand for development land, changes in plot ratios, and bouts of economic prosperity and growth would combine to trigger seasons of fevered en bloc sales. After running its course, each wave would quieten down once the frenzy passed.The latest en bloc craze occurred in 2017 and 2018 as many homeowners jumped on the bandwagon and developers actively leveraged on the potential of many existing developments. The real estate market witnessed about 31 deals in 2017 for a total of S$8.5 billion, and 36 deals in 2018 for a total of S$10.3 billion.However, this momentum was hamstrung by the implementation of further government measures in July 2018.The higher additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) rates and lower loan-to-value (LTV) limits meant that buyers faced greater challenges in attaining loans to finance their home purchases. Second or subsequent home buys became more restrictive, with higher costs.These measures impeded the demand for private residential units, casting a shadow over developers as they struggled to find ways to position their development units to garner interest from prospective purchasers as well as cope with the pressure stemming from the additional non-remittable 5 per cent ABSD paid upfront upon the purchase of a residential property.ARE COLLECTIVE SALES POSSIBLE IN TODAY'S MARKET?With the many steps and requirements in a potential collective sale, as well as the time needed, is there a sweet spot where it would be possible for a collective sale to be successful in today's market?After all, in the current climate, many have been caught in the squall of the pandemic-led economic downturn, and developers and homeowners face many uncertainties that could waylay the possibility of any collective sale.Despite the Singapore economy being mired in the effects of the pandemic, the private residential market has shown resilient sales volume and pricing. Therefore, in the wake of Covid-19, it is just possible for collective sales to be successful.Smaller quantum collective sales consisting of a project potential of about 200 units, priced within S$200 million, could yet find willing buyers. Should existing homeowners and developers find a reasonable middle ground, both parties could benefit - against conventional thinking - in the prevailing uncertain economic conditions.THE NEXT EN BLOC SEASONThe Covid-19 outbreak and the disruptions to human and business activity in Singapore has led to a dearth of land sales in 2020. Most of the Government Land Sales (GLS) sites sold this year were awarded in the first three months of the year, and generally at prices that did not take into account the economic recession that would ensue due to the pandemic.With developers taking a cautious stance on procuring development plots due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, it will be a while before acquiring land regains some measure of momentum.As at the end of Q2 2020, there were 53,055 private residential homes under various phases of development, where 21,113 units have already been sold. Therefore, a total of some 31,942 new private homes in the pipeline were as yet unsold.Given that primary market sales volume was not too badly affected by the \"circuit breaker\", and buying volume soon recovered to pre-circuit breaker levels as pent-up demand characterised the period (July 2020 onwards) after restrictions were eased, the supply of new homes will eventually run down significantly sometime from 2022 onwards.Developers will once again be in the market for development land, assuming that by then the novel coronavirus has retreated and the economy has begun to show signs of recovery.In addition to GLS sites where residential land is generally sold on 99-year leasehold tenure, developers will also look to the collective sales market for privately-held land, where freehold and 999-year leasehold sites can be found.In this fashion, the collective sale mechanism works in symbiotic tandem with the GLS process, as it allows for the constant renewal of precious land with aged developments.With much of Singapore's land resource being leasehold, the collective sales process also offers homeowners an exit option as the lease runs down on their assets.COLLECTIVE CALIBRATION: BALANCING LAND UTILITY WITH URBAN RENEWALThe role that the collective sale mechanism plays in recycling land in Singapore for new developments provides options beyond the GLS Programme, where free enterprise is fostered to create mutual benefit for owners, developers, buyers, and sellers.However, the government could also enhance some of the existing processes surrounding collective sales to improve clarity, as well as to finetune the balance of expectations from developers.PRE-APPLICATION FEASIBILITY STUDY (PAFS)For instance, let's look at a Pre-Application Feasibility Study (PAFS) that might need to be submitted to the Land Transport Authority (LTA) for collective sale proposals.In Outline Applications and Development Applications, following the collective sales of residential properties typically result in a significant increase in the number of dwelling units (DUs) being proposed over existing ones. This may strain existing road networks and lead to congestion and disamenities for residents in the area.To address these issues early, real estate agencies (acting on behalf of collective sale owners) consult LTA and may conduct a PAFS, if so required by LTA. Should LTA deem that a PAFS is required for the subject property, a traffic consultant would be engaged to assess the transport impact and recommend a development proposal with an estimation on the supportable number of dwelling units for the potential new development.A PAFS is currently only applicable to collective sale sites, and does not apply to single-owner land parcels. Moreover, the criteria for when a PAFS is required is unclear. There have been instances where different developments in the same area yielded different verdicts from LTA.Perhaps the criteria for when a PAFS is required should be determined by the proposed number of DUs in the new development and/or the category of the roads in the vicinity which lead to the development. Perhaps the LTA can be clearer as to when PAFS is required and when it is not. Additionally, the process of conducting a PAFS is often long-drawn, sometimes spanning over 15 months. To coincide a PAFS approval and a collective sale, which is subject to strict legal timelines, can be a real challenge.It would probably be more efficient and practical if an in-principle approval can be granted after broad guidelines and concerns are covered, leaving smaller details to be settled at a later stage.REMISSION OF ABSD FOR DEVELOPERSIn another example, developers are required to complete the development and sell all residential units within five years from the date of acquisition for development sites of more than four units, and within three years for development sites of four or less units, in order to obtain remission of ABSD.This creates a widely disparate imbalance in what is expected of developers who are developing land parcels of differing sizes, allowable built-up areas and total number of units.The time needed to sell five units is grossly different from the reasonable time it would take to sell projects of 100 units, and then again with those of 200, 500, and more than 1,000 units.Moreover, there will be times of brisk sales in years of economic prosperity and there will be periods of lacklustre sales when the economy is not doing well - not to mention black-swan events such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.Perhaps a graduated schedule of time limits in years could be prescribed based on the total number of units. For example, projects of up to 600 units could be given up to five years to build and sell all units. And for every additional 200 units, an extension of another year could be added, subject to a cap of ten years.Thus, the time limit for disposal is weighed against a quantifiable and measurable physical scale for a more balanced treatment.Would this not then be a fairer and more reasonably calibrated treatment in the application of ABSD, instead of wielding it as a blunt one-size-fits-all instrument for projects that comprise a mere five units to those that have more than 1,000, or even more than 2,000 units?"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

We ask the experts.FollowRoundtable panellists:Moderator: Siow Li Sen, senior correspondent, The Business TimesPROPERTY ownership is, much like food, a bit of a Singapore national obsession. But just as overindulgence with food can be unhealthy, is it sustainable for our long-term financial health if we spend our weekends visiting showflats? In terms of asset allocation and, even more critically, how big of a role should real estate play in providing a stable income stream for retirement? We ask the experts.How much should property or real estate form in one's asset allocation?Alfred Chia: It really depends. In Singapore, we have very high home ownership of more than 90 per cent. It is a very important asset class and big liability if there is mortgage loan tied to it. Here are two scenarios to consider.Scenario 1: An ordinary salaried worker owns a Housing Development Board (HDB) flat worth S$500,000. He has very little cash savings and only S$50,000 in his Central Provident Fund (CPF) Special account. Property will form 90 per cent of his entire assets. While he should start saving in cash, he may not be able to do that effectively due to other commitments. If his housing loan is S$100,000, his net worth will be S$450,000.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Scenario 2: High-income earning couple owns two properties worth a total of S$3 million. They have cash savings, CPF, Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) and equities worth a total of S$1 million. Property will form 75 per cent of their entire assets. If their housing loan is S$2,000,000, their net worth will be S$2,000,000Christopher Tan: Unfortunately, there is no absolute answer for this. Real estate is an asset class that can give both income and capital growth. It also hedges against inflation.However, since the potential high return from real estate really comes from leveraging, this makes investing in real estate risky. So the decision on how much real estate one should have in his total portfolio will depend on two factors.Firstly, from the investment perspective, one should not hold so much real estate that it forms the majority of one's overall portfolio. They will be taking too much concentrated risk.Secondly, from the financial health perspective, in holding real estate, your total debt-to-asset ratio should not be more than 50 per cent. In addition, your total debt servicing ratio should not be more than 40 per cent.James Cheo: The global pandemic has resulted in the sharpest economic contraction on record. However, asset markets have held up surprisingly well and better than might be expected given the size of the downturn. The swift and big intervention by central banks and governments has supported risk assets and put a floor under their prices, including real estate.At the current juncture, we have a broadly neutral allocation to global real estate. We recommend moderate-risk investors to hold about 3.3 per cent of their portfolios in global real estate, while a higher risk investors can hold up to 7.4 per cent.Within global real estate, we have preference for industrial and logistics sector, and a lesser preference for retail real estate.Evy Wee: Owning a residential property is still seen as a sound investment for most Singaporeans, even after the implementation of cooling measures such as the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) and Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR).With the ABSD, the opportunity cost of owning a second property has gotten higher. Although real estate might not be as attractive as before the anti-speculation measures were implemented, it is still a viable asset class and could still form part of an asset allocation strategy.Historically, residential property has yielded returns higher than inflation. And, depending on the timing and investment horizon, the return from property investment might have exceeded that of some shares.Real estate also helps to diversify an investor's portfolio as it is less correlated to traditional asset classes. However, there are several factors to consider before buying a property, which is a big-ticket item for many people. These factors include affordability, lack of liquidity, transaction costs, and sustainability of rental yields.Angie Lee: For an Asia-Pacific (Apac) client with a balanced risk profile, Credit Suisse's strategic asset allocation (SAA) currently recommends 5 per cent in global real estate investment trusts (Reits) and another 5 per cent in private equity funds, which can include private real estate.Credit Suisse's outlook on real estate is that listed real estate is expected to continue to benefit from low interest rates for longer, though structural challenges have intensified due to Covid-19. We expect a total return for listed real estate in developed markets of around 5 per cent over the five-year horizon.The US is one of our preferred developed markets, supported by favourable sector exposure. We expect Asia Pacific and emerging markets to deliver the best performance, as they should benefit from stronger economic growth relative to developed markets.Closer to home here in Singapore, we expect real estate equities in the Apac region to return 6.5 per cent per annum over the next five years, driven by strong economic growth and a relatively high dividend yield of 4.4 per cent. Singapore real estate equities are expected to deliver a return of approximately 7 per cent per annum over the five-year period.Kelvin Goh: Typically when it comes to investing, we would not usually consider property as part of one's asset allocation. However, mortgage payments would certainly factor into an individual's expenses and be a consideration in financial planning.If I use the mortgage servicing ratio as a guide, it should not be more than 30 per cent based on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's guidelines. That means the individual should not spend more than 30 per cent of their gross monthly income on mortgage payments.I would rationalise that, given the Covid-19 situation, the increased odds of a potential job loss and the longer runway that may be needed to find another job, you should budget for a significantly lower mortgage payment and deploy cash as far as possible.Jacquelyn Tan: Real estate can form part of a diversified investment portfolio. Real estate has low correlation to other asset classes such as stocks and bonds and has lower volatility in comparison with them.As an investment, real estate also offers a stable albeit slow rate of return over the long term. As part of UOB's Risk-First approach, we advise that investors consider the risks of any investment over returns, focus on core investments to protect and safeguard their assets before taking on more tactical investments.Can property provide a stable source of income during retirement?Alfred: Continuing on from the two scenarios mentioned before, here is what will likely happen.Scenario 1: Property will be this individual's major asset. As long as he has paid up his mortgage by age 65, it can be monetised for his retirement through renting any spare rooms, right-sizing the property to a smaller one, and making use of the HDB Lease Buyback scheme.Scenario 2: Properties are assets in which the couple has chosen to invest. As long as they have paid up mortgage by age 65, they have a place to stay in while collecting rental income from the other. Combined with their financial resources, they will have a very comfortable retirement.Christopher: Generally speaking and of course depending on the quality and location of your property, it can indeed provide a stable source of income during retirement. Many of our clients hold real estate and we integrate it with their total retirement portfolio together with their CPF, bonds and equities to give them a reliable stream of income throughout their retirement years.James: We advocate a multi-asset income portfolio with diversified income streams to meet investors' needs. A well-diversified portfolio is needed not only to generate income but to preserve capital.There are various income streams investors can use to build income portfolios. To construct a resilient income portfolio, investors have to combine income from bonds, equity dividends, and income from alternative assets. Real estate - whether from Reits or income from property - is one such income source for portfolio construction.Angie: Rental yield, along with other dividend yields from other asset classes, certainly form a stable source of income during the golden years. At Credit Suisse, we offer investors a suite of investment products which include private-equity fund solutions covering the real estate space.In 2020, we continue to grow our real estate book as we successfully launched a private Reit with one of the largest property investors and owners, which offers an interesting yield to our clients in a volatile market.The stable monthly distribution of this solution in a low-yielding environment was an important consideration for our Apac clients who continue to be very income-focused.Evy: The classic formula of owning an investment property is to make money through holding and renting the property while it appreciates, then selling it for a profit or leaving it as a legacy for our beneficiaries. When this is done via leverage - that is, using a small amount of our own money while borrowing the rest - it can be an attractive proposition for accumulating wealth.Real estate as an asset class also acts as a diversifier in an investment portfolio. The rental flows from investment properties can provide a stable source of income during retirement, as most tenancy agreements are renewed every 12 or 24 months.However, the sustainability of rental yields is dependent on various factors such as the economy, the property's location, amenities and rental demand. It is prudent to expect challenges such as rising mortgage rates and fluctuating tenant demand, and avoid relying solely on rental income during your golden years.Do set aside sufficient financial resources to cushion you in the event that your rental income is unable to cover the running costs of the property such as the mortgage, maintenance and repair costs. And be mindful to review your housing loan package when the opportunity arises, and have an exit strategy.Kelvin: For a retiree who has paid off their investment property and can enjoy regular monthly income from a rental unit, this notion certainly holds true. However, if there is one thing this year has shown us, it is that traditional assumptions can be thrown rapidly out of the window. In the case of rentals, what happens when your tenant loses their job, is unable to pay their rent, and has to move out?Based on selected property websites, the typical property rental yield in Singapore is around 2-3 per cent. There are other viable investment and income alternatives for investors, given this pay-out range and the liquidity risk involved for a property investment, especially if you are tied down by a huge mortgage.Property is practically a national obsession. Is this sustainable or healthy for one's financial planning?Alfred: Property has proven to be a very good asset class in Singapore. While we always say \"past performance is not a guide to future\", it is also a vote of confidence in Singapore as a stable country with stable economic growth. For example, some key reasons foreigners purchase expensive properties in Singapore are to preserve their wealth and legacy planning.Another reason why property is a very high-performing asset class over years is the leverage effect.But when it comes to loans, it is also a double-edged sword.Property investors need to recognise the risks: What if due to economic crisis, tenants cannot pay the rental? What if investors lose the ability to service the loan? What if there is a spike in interest rates?It is very important to conduct prudent financial planning and risk management.On that note, the government does recognise this and they try to ensure a stable and sustainable property market through property cooling measures. The impact of a runaway property market will be unimaginable.Another important policy is the TDSR Framework, to ensure prudent borrowing and lending.Christopher: In my opinion, as long as one does not overly depend on one asset class and does not overly extend their borrowing such that it makes them financially unhealthy, it is a good asset class to hold.However, this seems to be unlikely for most Singaporeans.Given that the median household income in Singapore is about S$9,000 per month, it is not easy to be able to own two or three properties (including residential property) and, at the same time, remain financially healthy and have a well-diversified portfolio. So the property investing game is really for the wealthier families.But wealthy or not, investors should consider other asset classes such as Reits and equities that can give them the returns they need without compromising their financial health.James: There is a role for property in investors' portfolio. However, due to the illiquidity and chunkiness of each property investments, there are constraints and limitations. For example, with limited capital outlay, it is difficult to achieved a globally diversified physical property portfolio, as each property requires a sizeable capital outlay coupled with stringent tax rules. Achieving global diversification is challenging purely by owning physical properties.Kelvin: From the number of Facebook ads touting the benefits of owning as many properties as possible, I would say it is an unhealthy obsession.It is important to keep in mind the need to manage one's finances well, especially with what is usually considered the biggest expense in one's lifetime. The debate over 99-year leasehold HDB flats show that there may have been some misguided thinking by those who bet big on old flats in prime locations, hoping the flats' leases would magically renew.Last year, our inaugural OCBC Financial Wellness Index survey indicated that 73 per cent of Singaporeans are not on track with their retirement plans. Given that mortgage payments tend to occupy a significant part of one's salary, and with a decent proportion using CPF to supplement these mortgage payments, there is a direct impact on retirement planning.The CPF Board indicates that about half of its active members are using their CPF for mortgage payments. And if you add the fact that CPF accounts currently yield a 2.5 per cent interest, it is a significant opportunity cost on retirement planning, especially when compounded over time.It is also important to note that the property and rental market is cyclical in nature. There are peaks and troughs. Property investors may well retire at the most inopportune time within a cycle, which means they may potentially incur losses at a time when they need their money the most.Are Reits a better alternative to being a landlord?Christopher: Reits are better alternatives to physical real estate on many counts. They are more liquid, lower cost and easier to access. When you invest in a basket of Reits, you are investing in a well-diversified basket of real estate in retail, commercial, office, hospitality sectors.In addition, unlike being a landlord, there is no need to manage tenants - which can be a real pain especially in your retirement years and if you like to travel in your golden years.Reits typically have a distribution rate of about 4-5 per cent and have been able to deliver some capital appreciation along with the relatively stable distributions. As measured by the FTSE ST Real Estate Investment Trust Index, total annualised returns from Feb 2009 to Oct 2020 are around 7.5 per cent. This puts Reits in between equities (as measured by MSCI AC World) and bonds (as measured by FTSE World Govt Bond Index 1-5 years).Still, investors like owning real estate as it gives them the psychological satisfaction of being a real property owner, which they cannot get from investing in Reits.Having said the above, since the risk-versus-reward characteristics of Reits is between that of bonds and equities, how much Reits one should hold in their portfolio depends on whether they are investing for income or as part of their capital growth portfolio. It is not uncommon to see investors who are investing for income to hold 40-50 per cent of their portfolio in Reits.On the other hand, for investors holding a diversified portfolio for growth, they may hold between 10 per cent to 20 per cent of their portfolio in Reits, depending on their risk appetite.Kelvin: Reits are listed companies which operate and manage properties. Investing in Reits allows one to, in a way, own part of a shopping mall, and get access to the rental income stream of the tenants within the mall, as well as specialised property management experience. So you can be detached from the day-to-day activities of running the properties in the portfolio, while receiving a steady income stream.Reits offer investors a liquid vehicle through which to invest in income-generating real estate without having to own the actual illiquid properties, and it is certainly more affordable.However, Reits come with their own set of risks, as can be seen by the recent closure of major retailers. Should the retailer not be replaced, the cash flow could be lost and this will result in a drop in the distributable income the Reit pays out.As Reits are also highly-geared, a spike in interest rates will have implications on the price of the Reit. And just like any other investment, you are subject to price risk should anything untoward happen to the Reit in question, which can run from poor management to a pandemic - such as the one happening now."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The stint has certainly helped bridge my understanding of the intricacies of cross culture working relationships and has benefited me greatly after my return from China. The better appreciation of culture and differences in business environment along with understanding of the Chinese regulations and business practices has helped me to better service the requirements of our Chinese clients.The COVID-19 pandemic has led to demand and supply shocks to many businesses and industries. Many industries and sectors are affected in many different ways and the impact varies across industries and sectors. Even before the pandemic struck, leaders were already bracing for a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) business environment.The pandemic has taken this to a new scale and many business leaders are now scrambling to re-calibrate their businesses to the new normal environment. Given the changes in consumer preferences and new working environment which the pandemic has brought about, businesses are fast adapting as the situation keeps evolving. Many leaders are realising that the 5 years plan that they had devised previously is now obsolete and it is ever important to stay relevant and adaptable through the implementation of flexible plans instead. For many leaders who are in the drivers seat, their left leg is now on the clutch, getting ready to shift gears, depending on the situation. Constant re-strategising and re-prioritising is what leaders have to do.How are leaders responding to the pandemic affecting their operations? For those whose companies and industries that have been badly hit, what do owners need to consider on the road to recovery?For many businesses and industries, the pandemic has hastened the transition from a bricks and mortar business model to one of online business operations, sales and services. While it looks likely, things may not revert back to pre-pandemic practices once the pandemic passes and the following are considerations for owners preparing themselves while the economy gets on the road to recovery:Respond to changed customers needs- A new normal warrants new ways of serving customers needs, which could be fundamentally different from pre-pandemic.Digitalisation- The pandemic has hastened the speed of digitalisation and the trend is definitely set to continue. Companies will need to embrace the trend to stay ahead of the curve.Newer and better ways of working and collaborating- The pandemic has spawned new and sometimes better ways to collaborate. Some of these could result in cost savings for business owners which provide long term benefits in terms of reduced rentals, electricity bills, efficiency and productivity etc. Offshoring and outsourcing operations may be on the cards for many organisations looking to harness cost-savings.Re-calibration of supply chains- Many businesses have faced supply chain and logistical disruptions in the pandemic. Many of these supply chain arrangements need to be re-configured for it to be more sustainable in the long term.Cash flow planning and management- Despite the numerous government support and subsidies, many businesses will continue to grapple with cash flow problems resulting from slower collections, lower inventory turns, financing and working capital issues. And hence more robust and long term planning around cash flow is becoming ever more critical.How can the management support their employees and stakeholders during these tough times?Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, it is also important to support employees and stakeholders during these tough times. Some ideas include:Being realistic on expectations on employees- Its after all a pandemic and recession, its natural for business to be slow. Pragmatic business owners and leaders will acknowledge the fact and realign their focus to employee development, readying their employees for the time when the economy picks up.Adopting practices that can minimise job losses- New work structure, shorter working hours, flexible working and compensation are some of the steps that companies can take to avoid job losses.Prioritise helping local suppliers and customers- Some measures could include paying suppliers on a prompt basis, purchasing from local sources whenever possible and thinking of creative ways and means to help customers cut costs, including perhaps offering financing alternatives.More active community engagement and assistance- For companies not as badly affected by the impact of the coronavirus, steps could be taken to help out local communities. For instance, provision of sanitation equipment/supplies, providing logistical support for distribution of essential supplies, donations to help out those impacted or employee volunteer programs in place to help with local charities or government initiatives. These measures will also help put the corporation in a good stead as an excellent corporate citizen, contributing to its branding efforts, and positioning it for the long term."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This led to the temporary suspension of operations of 10 food courts, three quick-service restaurants, two full-service restaurants, and 26 kiosks. Lower foot traffic following the easing of restrictions also drove profits lower.In 2020, Koufu opened four new food courts, one quick-service restaurant, and three kiosks. It is looking into expanding its operations in Macau, Malaysia, and Thailand and continues doing business in Indonesia and Philippines.As of end December 2020, Koufu has been operating 51 food courts; 18 coffee shops; a commercial mall; 79 food and beverage stalls; 186 licensed stalls, kiosks, and stores; 39 food and beverage kiosks; four full-service restaurants; and seven quick-service restaurants.Share prices closed at $0.67 Tuesday, a mere $0.01 increase from its previous close of $0.66."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Just in time, Lebond - Singapore's first AI-enabled smart and green B1 industrial building with co-working features, was launched this March.It's developer, Beblu, anAI tech property development and management company, constructed Lebond by refurbishing an old building without compromising its exterior features.Sustainable developments are the future where you do not have to tear down existing buildings, or rather, you just have to refurbish existing buildings, of course, with the hub of technology to make it new and modern so as to reflect the modern times as far as to maximise the value of the building itself, Beblu CEO Kenny Chai told Singapore Business Review.Amongst Lebonds green features is its solar panels.In Singapore, the solar energy capacity was 203 Megawatts-peak (MWp) in 2018, and the government seeks to increase this to 350 MWp by 2020, and 1 GWp beyond 2020, according to the National Climate Change Secretariat of Singapore.If we realise that a lot of buildings are underutilised, there's a lot of real estate available on the rooftops of buildings that can enable them to build the solar panels, and to actually get energy savings from them, as well, he said.Out with the old, in with the newWhilst the exterior of the Lebond building may be traditional, its interior is entirely modern where it has computer sensors and controls, which can be navigated through a phone.We actually develop our own proprietary solution that allows the tenants and the management to actually control all aspects of the buildings like this solar panel, energy charging, energy savings, lighting controls, aircon controls, said Chai.To manage the smart controls, Chai said the Beblu app, which is available in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, connects to the buildings central server. Through the app, it can control the lights and even oversee tenant management with a tap of the phone.Instead of traditional switches or even traditional control panels, anyone can just use the phone to access the building. Of course, with the permission of the tenants of the building, [visitors] canuse the QR code to enter the units of the tenants [they] are visiting, he said, adding that this feature makes Lebond unique from other buildings in Singapore.Asked about the costs of installing and maintaining the building, Chai responded that there will be 50% savings of entire running costs over the next three to five years because of the apps preventive maintenance of the building, which means there are artificial intelligence sensors that can detect problems before they happen.So this is, in itself, preventive maintenance, which is a lot lower than actual maintenance. And by doing preventive maintenance, we compound the energy savings that we actually have on our app, which will turn off the lights and all the features, including all the environmental systems in the building at a certain time, he added.The Beblu app for Lebond also reduced management costs because it saves labour expenses, said Chai, who is also a property management expert.In the long run, the Beblu CEO said they are working with other developers to help in cutting running costs for buildings and to disrupt the property management market.Chai said their firm also sees the trend of their technology on lowering manpower costs and easing management tasks.To actually make the ease of management easier for the managing team to manage all aspects of the building, tenant management, energy consumption, and even preventive maintenance all in one solution, said Chai."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The program recognises the biggest companies in Malaysia for their hard work and dedication that significantly enhanced their business.Introduction of Professionally Managed Workers Accommodation (PBWA) in Klang ValleySince the 1980s, the manufacturing and industrial sector has underpinned the Malaysian economy as an important contributor to our GDP growth and this has consequently spurred the increase of foreign workers population within the country. However even with a large number of close to 2 million registered foreign workers as at end of 2019, the living conditions of these population have always been a neglected area in the constant pursue of economic growth.The unsanitary and cramped living conditions of these foreign workers have been the cause of many hygiene and social issues for neighbourhoods close to industrial areas. More recently in early 2020, these very same deplorable conditions gave rise to COVID clusters that fuelled the spread of the pandemic in the country, warranting the first few Enhanced Movement Control Orders (EMCOs) being enforced at buildings used predominantly as worker quarters i.e. Selangor Mansion, Malayan Mansion, etc.The Knight Frank team felt a strong conviction towards matters related to workers housing as it is an integral part of the industrial real estate ecosystem. However, there is significant gap in the market with no ready immediate managed dormitory that manufacturers can tap into. As such, the team collectively and decisively manifested their strong conviction into actionable steps by playing the part to address the bottleneck within industry with the introduction of the very first professionally managed workers accommodation within Klang Valley by securing the largest international provider of professionally managed workers accommodation in Singapore & Malaysia Centurion Westlite to manage c. 6,000 beds of Purpose-Built Workers Accommodation (PBWA) in partnership with the state development arm of Selangor (PKNS) within Petaling Jaya.Knight Franks CSR drive in combating COVID and promoting ESGDuring the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the immediate origination of new PBWA supply provided the necessary tools for immediate COVID management and business continuity plans. Companies and industrialist now have a better avenue to flatten the pandemic curve associated with foreign labour population by reducing concentration risks. Industrialists can strategize to move their workers into different portions of managed accommodations to diversify concentration risks associated to any single dwelling unit / plant. Any COVID infections can be detected and quarantined immediately to avoid further spread, and accordingly business continuity of the rest of the units remained unaffected.With companies relocation of their workers into PBWA, the existing residential schemes used to accommodate previous workers housing can be alleviated from additional risks of COVID spread and create a barrier of distance to eliminate risks of infections between the manufacturing plants and residential communities.In the longer-term view, the introduction of sustainable and equitable housing solutions to foreign workers via professionally managed purpose-built workers accommodation (PBWA) in substitute of present haphazardly managed / cramped housing is Knight Frank Malaysias way of driving the environment, social, and governance (ESG) agenda.Elevating the Malaysian industrial landscape to compete in the global arenaKnight Frank Malaysia envisions the provision of equitable workers housing through PBWA will elevate Malaysia industrial landscape to be ready to receive more foreign direct investments (FDIs), especially from multinational corporations (MNCs) that pride themselves in ethical supply chain sourcing and ESG initiatives.With the current climate and global changes, ESG is gaining significant momentum as an important investment evaluation tool alongside financial factors. Progressive workers welfare, including equitable workers accommodation, will gain stride as part of the ESG agenda. With PBWA, Malaysia now can offer the complete ecosystem which manufacturers and industrialists prioritize when making country selection and investment decisions further solidifying Malaysia as an attractive investment destination in Asia.Paving the way for more PBWA via exemplary working modelWith the introduction of successful PBWA working model spearheaded by the state development arm of Selangor in partnership with Centurion - this will accelerate industry awareness and serve as model to be replicated throughout Klang Valley and Malaysia. This very PBWA project has been referenced and studied as part of the formulation of new regulations governing future PBWA developments.Whilst Knight Frank Malaysia will continue to play their part to advocate the need and importance of proper and professionally managed workers dormitories in the future of our economy. A bespoke publication highlighting The Changing Landscape of Workers Accommodation was produced as part of this meaningful effort.For more information: www.knightfrank.com.myTo access Knight Franks Workers Accommodation publication: https://www.knightfrank.com.my/research/malaysia-workers-accommodation-report-2021-8618.aspx?search-id=01e403e5-2a7b-4c71-8afb-3248ffb275c2&report-id=2348&rank="}], "max_tokens": 10}}

But alas, the global economy continues to be challenged in 2022 by high inflation, rising interest rates and energy costs, and geopolitical tensions.Amid these macroeconomic uncertainties, the 3 Best Chief Financial Officer (CFO) awardees of the Singapore Corporate Awards 2022, tell The Business Times that capital management discipline, a strong balance sheet and healthy cash lines, as well as a productive and diverse workforce, will help their companies tide through these challenges.Andrew Lim, group chief financial officer for real estate investment manager CapitaLand Investment, said that while real estate is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation, the rising cost of capital also necessitates a more deliberate approach to underwriting any new investments, which has affected the pace of deal-making.The manager aims to scale its funds under management and fee-related earnings through fund management, lodging management and its full stack of operating capabilities, underpinned by a well-diversified investment portfolio across asset classes and international capital partners.Lim was named best CFO in the category for companies with over S$1 billion in market capitalisation. Eve Chan from Metro Holdings was the awardee for companies with between S$300 million and S$1 billion in market capitalisation, while Yeo Swee Cheng from LHN was the awardee for companies with under S$300 million in market capitalisation.Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.All 3 companies have some operations in real estate.The reopening of most economies around the world has boosted retail and workspace recovery, Lim said, noting that demand and rents are continuing to recover in CapitaLand's offices, business parks, industrial and logistics portfolio.The company remains \"cautiously optimistic\" on the China market, he added. \"With the ongoing correction of the real estate market, we see the long-term potential to tap the Chinese market's liquidity for scaling our investment management platform,\" he said.Metro's Chan said the group has over the years diversified its portfolio into \"defensive asset classes\", such as co-investing in industrial and logistics properties as well as purpose-built student accommodation.Many such strategic investments happened during the pandemic, Chan said. With a strong balance sheet and healthy free-cash and resources, relatively low debt-equity ratio and unutilised banking lines, the group is in a good position to navigate the current period of heightened uncertainty, and still be able to capitalise on attractive investment opportunities that arise, she said.On the real estate front, LHN is placing its bets on the co-living trend. During the pandemic, the group acquired more such properties, in an effort to grow Coliwoo, its co-living brand.Delays in home renovation due to the manpower crunch is expected to further drive up demand for co-living spaces, along with the pick-up in the global travel market, Yeo said.The shortage of skilled manpower remains one of the biggest challenges for LHN, which is primarily a logistics and facilities services provider.\"As the economy bounces back quickly with competition for skilled manpower becoming more intense, we are looking to spend more effort and costs to hire new talent while retaining our existing skilled staff to mitigate this issue,\" Yeo said.The use of digitalised and automated solutions has helped foster a more productive and efficient workforce, while retaining work quality and customers' satisfaction, she noted.For instance, queries for its space optimisation business are now managed entirely online. The use of cleaning robots has also reduced the physical demands on employees, allowing them to focus on more value-added tasks or on upgrading their skills.CapitaLand Investment's Lim said having talented, diverse people on the ground with the right values and experience to build and drive its business is one of the biggest challenges to scaling globally.\"So we take great efforts in recruiting good people worldwide, integrating them into the company, and investing in grooming talent from within to build a pipeline of capable leaders to steer our global business as we move forward,\" he said.CapitaLand Investment's priority for the next 12 months is to grow fee income from its listed funds and private vehicles, and lodging management. It is also looking to strengthen its fundraising network in China, to complement the overall expansion of its network across Asia, Europe, and North America, Lim said.\"Our teams on the ground around the world will continue actively seeking attractive opportunities to further diversify our portfolio across product lines, geographies and asset classes to ensure income stability for our investors,\" he said.Like Lim, Chan maintains a positive view on the medium-to-long term prospects on the Chinese market, where Metro predominantly operates.On the property front, Metro will continue to look for accretive investments and work with strategic partners in the group's core markets. On the retail front, it will continue to enhance its merchandise mix through collaborations with local and international business partners. The group is also growing its emphasis on e-commerce, and has partnered with platforms like Shopee and Lazada to better engage with digital consumers.LHN is also looking to introduce new services in its Work+Store business, with the growth in e-commerce activities. Over the years, this subsidiary business has already evolved from offering self-storage space to a fulfilment hub for warehousing logistics and workspace.Apart from being bullish on its co-living business, the group is expecting a rebound in leasing demand in its space optimisation business and an increase in demand for parking spaces for its car park business.BT is now on Telegram!For daily updates on weekdays and specially selected content for the weekend.

Compared to 12 months ago, however, the property market is now arguably frothier: the economic outlook has darkened, inflation is the highest in over a decade and cheap financing seems but a trend of the past.Just last week, another set of measures was rolled out to encourage prudent borrowing, bringing the property market closer to an inflection point.Should prospective homebuyers pull the trigger on a unit now or wait for a meaningful price correction? This article lays out our market prognosis and strategies for homebuyers.Impact of December 2021 cooling measures short-livedThe avalanche of headwinds began with the introduction of cooling measures late last year that raised additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) and tightened financing. The immediate aftermath was a lull of housing activity amid caution. Developers held back on launching sizeable new projects and overall sales volumes fell by a third in Q1 2022, while residential en-bloc activity slowed noticeably.By the second quarter, however, private home sales had rebounded. The robust take-up of new project launches, such as Piccadilly Grand and Liv@MB in the Rest of Central Region (RCR), reignited market engines and contributed to an acceleration of home prices in Q2 2022. In the Outside Central Region (OCR), the launches of AMO Residence in July and more recently Sky Eden@Bedokand Lentor Modern, werealso met with positive reception.Fresh September 2022 measures to encourage prudent borrowingTuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.The latest measures include raising the medium-term stress test interest rate used for computing loan eligibility from 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent for all housing loans. For Housing Board (HDB) loans, the loan-to-value (LTV) limit was also reduced from 85 per cent to 80 per cent, and a 3 per cent interest rate floor was introduced for loan eligibility computation.As mortgage rates have already exceeded 3 per cent in recent months, the upward calibration of the medium-term stress test interest rate is necessary to safeguard the debt servicing ability of borrowers in a rising rate environment.Homebuying affordability will undoubtedly be impacted going forward. Based on our simulation, a household with a monthly income of about S$12,200 would now only be eligible for up to S$1.41 million loan to support a S$1.88 million property purchase, versus a S$1.5 million loan for a S$2 million property purchase previously. The upshot is that some property hunters would have to adjust their budgets accordingly.Million-dollar HDB homesThe authorities are clearly concerned about the exuberance in the public resale market, of which the bulk of the latest round of measures are directed at.Looking at the residential market as an entirety, the ever-rising HDB resale prices will also have ripple effects on the private property segment. Therefore, policymakers are seeking to strengthen sustainability in the public housing market through the raising of the stress test rate, coupled with maintaining the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) limit at a prudent 30 per cent.Ultimately, a healthy and sustainable overall market is the governments objective.Market fundamentals intact and healthy over the long termThe recent success of various property launches are underpinned by idiosyncratic factors,such as pent-up local demand, and proximity to popular schools. Butthere are fundamental factors driving the wider market.For one, the labour market has remained extremely tight, despite slowing economic momentum; economists expect our unemployment rate to reach 2 per cent by the end of the year from an already-low 2.1 per cent presently. Coupled with strengthening wage growth, this has bolstered property demand. Another important driving metric is the continual build-up of household net worth, which hit a record S$2.46 billion in Q2 2022.Over a longer-time horizon, property demand is expected to still grow at a healthy pace. The secular decline in household size due to declining birth rates translates into sustained demand for housing units, albeit of smaller sizes. The mass adoption of hybrid work norms in the new pandemic normal has also led many to crave individual living spaces. The easing of borders and the new employment pass schemes to draw top talent and to plug skills shortages in the tech sector will help arrest the population decline and provide an uplift to property buying and rental demand.Near-term bumps aheadUndeniably, however, over the next few quarters, property demand is expected to moderate,amid multiple headwinds and the impact of the latest cooling measures.Forecasters polled by the Monetary Authority of Singapore expect economic growth to slow to 2.8 per cent next year from an expected 3.5 per cent this year, suggesting a bumpy ride ahead.The unabated increases in consumer prices and the upward calibration of mortgage payments are likely to weigh on overall consumer spending and big-ticket item purchases, such as homes and cars.Consequently, primary home sales are expected to moderate from about 13,000 units in 2021 to 9,000 units this year and ease further to 8,000 units next year.We expect overall private home prices to rise by about 9 per cent for 2022 following last years 10.6 per cent growth, with a further moderation to 1 to 3 per cent growth for 2023.In the public resale housing market, transaction volumes have softened for three consecutive quarters in Q2 2022. The stock of millionaires newly minted from the sale of HDB homes is likely to expand at a more modest pace, especially as previous and existing private property owners will now have to wait out 15 months before purchasing an HDB resale flat without subsidies. Homebuying demand for resale HDB flats will be tempered, although seniors aged 55 and above are exempted from the wait-out period if they downgrade to four-room or smaller resale flats.New pricing benchmarks, but homes are still affordableBarring a full-blown economic recession or fresh cooling measures, we remain sanguine on the property market. At just over 22,000 units, the stock of unsold units as of Q2 2022 amounts to merely two years of primary home sales, lending considerable pricing power to developers. Most of the unsold units are concentrated in projects due to be completed in 2024 or later, which means developers are in no hurry to clear inventory.As the market maintains pricing momentum, especially in the fringe and suburban segments, it would be a matter of time before the market shifts to a new pricing normal of around S$2 million for a new suburban home of say, 800 to 1,000 square feet. A household securing a 30-year S$1.5 million loan (75 per cent LTV) would need a minimum income of aroundS$13,000. For the upgrading cohort aged 30 to 44 years, more than 45 per cent of households draws a reported monthly income of S$12,000 or more, attesting to the relative affordability of new suburban homes even amid eye-watering prices.Owner-occupiers: forget bottom fishing, needs are keyGiven thebroadlyintact market upcycle, attempts to time the market bottom in the months ahead will likely prove futile. For owner-occupiers, needs-based considerations, such as location, amenities, connectivity, and proximity to schools and families, should take priority rather than bottom fishing.Based on land sites sold in the last two years, we expect a plethora of interesting launches over the next 12 months,such as mixed-use and integrated developments as well as downtown living options. More importantly than before, prospective homebuyers should carefully consider their ability to service their mortgage in a volatile economic environment and a climate of prolonged elevated interest rates.Research for value buysLooking beyond the glitter of the show suites and conducting adequate homebuying research with a level head could allow one to uncover some gems. For some projects which are completed, or nearing completion, developers could be dangling discounts to move remaining units. If prices of new homes have edged up considerably in a preferred locality, perhaps a resale home might be a prudent choice and offer more space for the buck.We also see relative value in the prime segment, given thatCore Central Region (CCR) home prices have only risen by a modest 12 per cent this cycle, compared to a 42 per cent and 36 per cent jump for RCR and OCR home prices respectively. The continual easing of borders and the open-door policy to foreign talent bode well for property demand, especially in prime areas.Investors: ride on policiesFor investors, aligning ones property purchase with national policy is one of the safest avenues to ride on healthy capital appreciation over the longer term. The governments Long-Term Plan Review has clearly demonstrated that beyond a 24/7 vibrant Central Business District, jobs are moving closer to homes.The unveiling of ambitious plans for the worlds first fully automated port at Tuas, the massive Changi Terminal 5 and the new Paya Lebar precinct would present new employment and property growth opportunities. In parallel, the continual expansion of our rail transport lines and construction of the North-South Corridor will improve connectivity and unlock property values.Property investment complements a diversified portfolioIn a climate of higher ABSD, taxes and interest rates, one could be forgiven for questioning the viability of property investments. Property demand is a derived demand and property investing is akin to investing in Singapores long-term future. Property investing also offers the added characteristic of leverage, albeit a double-edged element.Our simulations point to a projected internal rate of return (IRR) of 7 to 9 per cent per annum over a holding period of 10 years or more, which could still be an attractive risk-adjusted option for some, especially in a climate of financial market volatility. If ABSD is incurred, an IRR of around 5 per cent per annum is more likely. As such, property investment in the local context remains a meaningful complement to a diversified investment strategy and an effective hedge against inflation. Ride the cyclesThe final straw that may break the housing camels back would be an outright recession impacting employment and income, or the roll-out of further measures.While the property market cannot rise in a linear fashion indefinitely, its long-term prospects remain sanguine, on the back of Singapores political and economic stability. A reasonable entry price and exit strategy, adequate research and sound holding power will allow homebuyers to ride out market cycles victorious.

The real estate industry is at the heart of the current economic situation, with a sharp slowdown in activity and notable value adjustments resulting from the rapid shift in the outlook for interest rates and inflation. As a result, we expect to experience a period of adjustment in 2023 while investors, occupiers, lenders, and developers appraise the new valuation landscape. Even as the economic rebound strengthens post-pandemic across the Asia Pacific (Apac) region, the surging inflation accompanying it has complicated the real estate outlook. As most central banks in the region tighten monetary policies to combat inflation, growth will inevitably slow. Nonetheless, Apac will remain the worlds fastest-growing region, particularly supported by demand in domestic-oriented economies in emerging South-east Asia and India. While the Chinese Mainland economy may not reach its full potential output, growth could outperform expectations after pandemic restrictions were significantly eased towards the end of 2022. There have also been recent positive developments on the geopolitical front. One example is the G20 summit held in Bali in November. This was the first physical meeting between political leaders of major economies since the pandemic and signalled a thawing of US-China relations. Although it is unlikely to resolve all differences, a more consultative approach could revitalise global trade flows a crucial cog in export-dependent economies in the region. Inevitably, the regions interest rates will reach multi-year highs in 2023. As a result, real estate markets in Apac will have to weather a period of transition, as occupiers and investors relook their strategies in a rapidly evolving environment. Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.After a banner year in 2021, homebuyers are finally taking a breather and adopting a wait-and-see approach amid risingmortgage rates and an elevated inflationary environment. The rise in near-term interest rate expectations indicates that aprice reversal will be widespread across several regional key markets.Despite the recent double-digit correction, the pull-back was still moderate. New Zealand and Australias overall residential prices, in particular, are still 20 per cent and 25.5 per cent higher than at the start of the pandemic. Looking ahead, price correction is unlikely to be of the same magnitude as previous downturns. This is largely due to significantly higher construction costs (for new builds) and low unemployment rates, which will provide a cushion to prevent a steep fall in housing prices if economic prospects deteriorate further. The prime segment, where buyers are less sensitive to rising borrowing costs, is still thriving attributed to wealth preservation by high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). Safe haven assets will support HNWIs demand for prime properties in gateway markets, including Singapore, which is highly sought after by Greater China buyers due to its reputation as a growing hub for business and finance in Apac. The office sector is facing challenges due to the structural shift towards more hybrid work in a post-pandemic environment. Nonetheless, the relative resilience of prime demand over the past couple of years has left the sector in a better starting position, with prime vacancy low in many markets across the region. Catalysed by the weakening economic and operating environment, occupiers will be forced to review the quantum of space they hold. As a result, they will be more cautious in making lease decisions, while landlords will prioritise safeguarding their cash flow. With ongoing anxiety about the economic outlook, occupiers facing incoming lease expiry are more inclined to renew their leases for shorter terms instead of expanding or relocating. Renewal cases are currently dominating some Apac markets, and we could see more of this phenomenon in the coming year. While we foresee shadow space emerging amid mass layoffs, significant space reductions across Apac should be few and far between underpinned by a stronger preference for office-based work in cities like Tokyo and Seoul, as compared to the United States and Europe. Market conditions in 2023 will continue to favour occupiers, as highly amenitised buildings with sustainability accreditations are being completed and ready for occupancy. In the coming years, it will be vital for companies to create environments that support a variety of work styles for their employees, enabling them to do so comfortably and productively. As such, businesses are now at an optimal point in time to evaluate how they can best provide for their employees and take steps to curate the most desirable workplaces for them. Since 2020, Apacs household spending has been on an upwards trajectory as real income rose. This was a boon for the logistics sector as vacancy rates tightened to record lows and rents surged. Fast forward to end-2022, consumers have re-evaluated their spending in light of moderation in real income growth and deteriorating sentiments. The pace of private consumption is expected to slow down but remain resilient in 2023. Companies are now resigned to slower sales as consumers scale back on purchases. E-commerce giant Amazon, for instance, anticipates sluggish sales during the festive season, indicating that individuals and companies are less willing to spend. Correspondingly, to avoid further complications in supply chains, businesses are continuing to leverage the China plus One strategy and diversifying production into other markets. Demand, albeit declining, is being diverted to India and South-east Asian countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand enticed by lower costs, ease of trade and a growing manufacturing base. Moreover, the rising middle-class population is driving the growth of these economies, rendering the logistics sector to display resiliency as it navigates through uncertainties. Fundamentals for the logistics sector in Asia-Pacific have yet to be as well-established as the US or Europe, leading to an acute shortage of modern facilities and fierce competition. As we encounter headwinds in 2023, market fundamentals will render a generally balanced logistics market in Apac, with rental growth set to moderate compared to the past two years. Logistics occupiers will continue committing to build-to-suit solutions and gravitate towards institutional-grade assets. Structural factors will still bode well for the sector in the long run. After over a decade of abundantly available capital, the rapid reversal in macroeconomic fundamentals is changing the playbook for real estate investment globally and regionally. Listed real estate has corrected in tandem with the heightened uncertainty, and transaction activity in private markets is set for a pause while in transition. With the rising tide of low-interest rates on an ebb, the search for a new equilibrium will bring about a period of dispersion as asset managers, investors, and developers appraise the new valuation landscape. On the cusp of a new era, several major themes will underpin the new investment landscape. 1. Inflation hedges Commercial real estate, which exhibits income growth potential, diversification benefits and relative stability, will see strengthened interest. Counter-cyclical as well as those which capture structural changes, from continued digitalisation trends to the regions wider demographic changes, can also offer opportunities. As building costs rise, there may be increased opportunities for refurbishment and repurposing of assets to capture alpha-based returns. 2. Flight to quality For commercial real estate to serve as an effective inflation hedge, it would require to some extent, landlords to successfully push through positive rental reversions. These conditions are particularly conducive in well-leased, quality assets located in gateway markets. We expect investors to focus particularly on core, liquid assets in prime locations with attractive yields relative to the cost of debt. 3. Rise of dollar investors We expect increased demand from dollar-denominated investors from North America, the Middle East, and parts of Asia, seeking to capitalise on the currencys strength and diversify their portfolios into the regions core markets. These investors are watching the re-pricing of markets closely and are ready to move quickly when conditions stabilise.4. Dominance of private and sovereign investors The final key theme in the short term is the greater dominance of private and sovereign investors. With longer horizons and deep pockets, these investors are prepared to move quickly to secure prime assets while there is limited competition. Over the last two years, Singapore has seen a huge influx of family offices from the US and Europe, and we see these private investors being the most aggressive buyers for trophy office assets in the regions safe-haven markets.

No longer just a place to sleep, they want spaces that are versatile and adaptablea home office during the day and transforms into a personal gym at night. Whilst urban properties with easy access to malls and public transportation are their popular choice, they often lack green spaces such as parks. Homebuyers are then faced with a tough choice between convenience and wellness. But developers are stepping up to meet their changing demands, a prime example of this is GuocoLand.GuocoLands latest developments, Lentor Modern and Midtown Modern, seem to have struck the right mix of convenience, versatility, and green space. Despite economic headwinds, GuocoLand sold over 84% of units in Lentor Modern just two days after its launch. Meanwhile, Midtown Modern sold over 60% of all units during its launch weekend in March 2021.We still see the market performing resiliently. One of the reasons for us saying this is mainly because most of the launches last year sold very well, Dora Chng, general manager (Residential) at GuocoLand, said, adding that the property market will likely benefit from multinational corporations setting up shop in Asia, as well as the growing middle-class population.This January, JLL reported that developers have returned with new launches rebounding to 410 units, the highest in four months. This also represented a 130.3% increase compared to only 178 units released in the same month last year.Pent-up demand from potential buyers who sat out of the market due to limited options available in 2022 is expected to return to pick up units from an increased line-up of project launches this year, Chia Siew Chuin, head of Residential Research at JLL, said. The anticipated return of Chinese buyers, particularly to the high-end/luxury segment of the residential market, will add to overall sales numbers.In addition, Singapores property market will be underpinned by a steady inflow of talent and wealth preservation. This will also boost demand for prime properties amongst international high-net-worth individuals (HNWI). In 2022, Singapores super-prime market and ultra-prime market saw a total of US$121b and US$18b worth of sales. It ranked second in the Asia Pacific and sixth globally.Singapore continues to attract high-net-worth homebuyers both domestically and from all over the world, Nicholas Keong, Head, Private Office, Knight Frank Singapore, said. Post-pandemic era, the country is regarded as a safe haven to a wider spectrum of high-net-worth individuals and families with the manner in which the government had the wherewithal and the financial resources to keep the economy and public health stable even in a period of global economic uncertainty and political tensions.Seize the day in a minuteHomeowners don't want to spend so much time commuting to and from work, to and from dinners in that aspect, Chng said.With this in mind, GuocoLand constructed Lentor Modern. This integrated mixed-use development is directly connected to Lentor MRT station, placing residents just a train ride away from schools and workplaces along the Thomson-East Coast Line.Moreover, GuocoLand introduced the One Lift Ride Lifestyle in Lentor Modern, where, as the name suggests, residents are just a lift ride away from the retail podium, supermarket, childcare centre, cafes, and restaurants.Living on top of this transit-oriented development, you can actually seize the day in one minute, she said.Need for green spacesWhat is deterring families from living in the city when it is so convenient to be right where everything is? Chng said. It's really the lack of greenery and family-oriented facilities in the developments in the city.To address this, GuocoLand conceptualised the Midtown Modern, where residents may stroll in more than 1 hectare of greenery within the development and take a dip in a 50-metre lap pool, a tennis court, and entertainment pavilions in Midtown Modern, and even a dance studio in Lentor Modern.Midtown Modern is one of the first family-oriented residential developments in the central business district. We will be the only CBD condominium with full facilities. The development is now 88% sold.Besides its connectivity, many homeowners chose Lentor Modern because of its proximity to green parks and spaces and the abundance of facilities such as a dance studio, pavilions, and open lawn areas where they can work on their health and fitness.Flexible units winAlthough many buyers are upgrading to larger units due to the change in their lifestyle needs, we noticed that most buyers do not really need a larger one. Rather, they are looking for a unit that is flexible to meet their needs, Chng said.GuocoLand introduced two to four-bedroom units in Lentor Modern that feature a versatile Flex Room designed with dimensions that can be used in a variety of ways. These Flex Rooms are small, but have enough space to fit a single bed, Chng said. It can be used as a nursery, gym, playroom, or even a guest bedroom. The rooms will also be helpful for home-based entrepreneurs in need of an office or workshop.Chng added Midtown Modern and Midtown Bay also have duplex units, where two identical units stacked above each other offer space for hosting guests on the lower level, whilst still allowing homeowners to keep their privacy preserved on the upper level.Lifestyle changes have evolved even before the pandemic. We noticed people entertaining family, friends, and business associates more frequently than before, Chng said.Home buyers may choose to host their guests in the function rooms in the clubhouse or at the private dining pavilions, instead of their homes.GuocoLand built their residential developments around these three key trends, which proved to be effective, as demonstrated by the quick up-take of Lentor Modern and Midtown Modern."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This practice has barred developers from getting the most out of their projects.To help property developers increase sales, Real Estate Analytics, Savills, and LanciaConsult joined forces to deliver a tool that can provide answers to queries regarding residential development like how much a unit should be sold for, and what price should be bid for a certain piece of land.The tool, called REA Developer Suite, does not only guide developers in residential pricing, but also the building process. It helps developers identify what type and what sizes of bedrooms should be built.The developer suite can come up with answers to such questions through the use of real-time data provided by Singapores largest real estate agents stored in a platform called SoRealProp.SoRealProp was established by PropNex, ERA, and Huttons, which together transact around 80% of all deals in Singapore. The platform was then acquired by Real Estate Analytics.The data lake is very extensive, it provides us real-time transactions that allow us to create [a] demand curve for any specific project.

So it's within 12 to 24 hours of a transaction being executed, he explained.Bottomline, Marriott said the suite takes out a lot of the guesswork that goes with developing residential projects.Developers use the static data that are available from the government currently to analyse the market and a great deal of gut feel being the experts in buying land and developing those properties, and ultimately selling it to the end user, Marriott said.[The developer suite] gives specific data and specific answers on what is the best price to pay for a piece of land. What is the best design of that land once purchased and then finally, what is the best price to sell the developed units? So the real three questions that the developer suite answers, he said.Paul said the margins of developers are less than 10% and by providing them answers as to what can optimise their sales through the suite, this margin can go up by 10% to 20%.The developer suite not only benefits developers, but also banks that are funding these developers, said Marriott.Jeff Cronkshaw, CEO of LanciaConsult, said their clients find the solution very interesting. As a partner of REA, LanciaConsult provides the go-to-market and engagement with sectors.Our team is working with the clients and helping them understand how best to use these products from a consulting perspective. Its very much a solution-based conversation with those developers and the finance sectors, Cronkshaw said.We're always seeking to provide the best, most novice, most practical solution for our clients and [the REA Developer Suite] is exactly that. For us, it's great to be able to go into a client meeting or conversation with a partner and bring this partnership and this product to them, he added.Looking ahead, Paul said he hopes to make the developer suite available for commercial and mixed-use projects. Currently, the tool is only available for residential developers.We've already had requests from the commercial arena, private equity, and investment funds, who have started to ask us whether we can deliver the same sort of service in the industrial and logistics, commercial and retail market, \" Marriott added.Paul said they also plan to expand the service geographically.This was born in Singapore and tested in Singapore, but we have had demands from several Asian countries already, so this is going to enable exponential growth, Paul said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Both agents dealt with individuals who were later found guilty of conducting illegal activities.Making sure such incidents dont happen again and to keep up with international standards, Singapore is dead set on tightening up regulations.Given the vibrancy of the real estate market in Singapore, the importance of having effective laws and regulations in place to safeguard against the occurrence of any ML or TF activities is well-recognized, Pat Lynn Leong, senior partner at Dentons Rodyk, told the Singapore Business Review.The requirementsUnder the new measure, developers will be required to perform risk analysis, carry out customer due diligence (CDD) measures, report suspicious transactions, and keep records for five years.In performing risk analysis, Leong said developers must consider looking into the profile of their purchasers and the countries which they are from or in.Gazalle Mok, partner at Rajah & Tann, said developers should also implement internal programmes and measures that include internal audits to test and monitor the policies, procedures and controls, with a corresponding duty to enhance them if necessary.When carrying out CDD, Leong said developers will have to fill checklists and forms which can be found in the Guidelines for Developers on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing, which was released last March.CDD is carried out in three levels: standard, simplified, and enhanced. Mok said the level of CDD will depend on the profile of the purchasers.The forms require the filling in of certain information such as the purchasers particulars or the particulars of the individual who is acting on behalf of the purchaser, Leong said. As for the checklist, developers may opt to use their own to conduct the CDD but must ensure that the prescribed requirements are complied with.Developers must complete both documents before granting an Option to Purchase (OTP) or before accepting any sum of money, including any booking fee from the purchaser.Developers should note that CDD must be performed even for existing purchasers with whom the transaction was entered into before the implementation of the new Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing (AMLTF) requirements, Leong underscored.Developers should also be aware that where CDD measures fail to be satisfactorily performed or completed, they must not grant an OTP, accept any money (including booking fee), or enter into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with the purchaser, she added.When there is a reason for developers to suspect their purchaser of being a terrorist under the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (TSFA) or UN Act, developers must not proceed with the issue of options, collect of monies, nor enter into SPAs.Developers must not open or maintain any account for, or hold and receive monies from an anonymous source or a purchaser with an obviously fictitious name, Leong said.If and when an OTP has been granted to the purchaser already, the developer must terminate the transaction, she said.Lastly, Leong said developers will need to keep a record of documents such as the OTP and SPA, for five years and make it available to the Controller of Housing.Other documents that need to be kept include Form 3, which is the particulars, documents and information to be provided to intending purchaser before issue of OTP, found in the First Schedule of the Housing Developers Rules, and the Records of Simplified Customer Due Diligence or Enhanced Customer Due Diligence Conducted if applicable.Heftier finesSingapores more stringent measures also come with heftier fines. According to Mok, developers who fail to comply with any of the new requirements will be guilty of an offence and be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000.Navin Naidu, partner at Dentons Rodyk and former Deputy Public Prosecutor said developers may also face suspension or revocation of any licence that has been granted to them if found guilty of any ML or TF offence.However, most individual liability for money-laundering related transactions continues to be governed by the Corruption Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Offences (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA), Naidu said.Individuals who knowingly, or with reason to believe, facilitate such transactions may be liable to prosecution for offences which would likely carry an imprisonment term. Persons convicted of ML or TF offences can also be disqualified from holding key appointments in developers, Naidu added.According to Leong, the suspension of licence may last up to 12 months.Prior to such revocation or suspension, the Controller will notify his intention to take such action against the developer and the developer will be given an opportunity to submit reasons or an explanation why its licence should not be revoked or suspended. Further, the developer may, within 30 days of being notified of the revocation or suspension, make an appeal to the Minister whose decision will be final, she said.Without a licence, developers cannot carry out housing developments in Singapore. Any developer who does so without the licence will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 and imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, said Leong.In addition, any person, such as the director, who has been convicted whether before, on or after the date of commencement of the Act of any ML or TF offence must also not hold or continue to hold a responsible position in a licensed housing developer. Should this be contravened, the developer will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000, the expert added.Mok said new licences will also not be granted to housing developers found to have previously been convicted of such offences.These penalties are only applicable to contraventions of these new implementations. Breaches of existing AML/CTF regulations found in the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act and the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act may incur more severe penalties, such as fines not exceeding $1 million for developers directly engaged in money laundering arrangements or activities, Mok underscored.Higher compliance costsSince developers will have to abide by the new requirements, Mok said they will likely face higher compliance costs.This will hit smaller developers especially hard as they lack the economies of scale and dedicated compliance personnel and programmes, said Mok.Leong had a similar sentiment, saying that compliance cost may be incurred for the filling up of the relevant forms, training of employees on AMLTF policies, implementation of an audit function to test the policies, procedures and controls, and the storing of relevant documents for five years.Further, given the involvement of the many stakeholders - lenders, developers, property consultants and other professionals working with the developers, some time will be required for the adjustment to these new requirements, she said.To better fulfill the requirements laid out by the new bill, Naidu said developers must train their employees and agents to ensure they are well-versed with the ML and TF risks presented by their purchasers.He said developers must see to it that their people are equipped to ask the correct questions of property purchasers, and are aware of circumstances when they may need to enquire further when red-flags are presented.The Dentons Rodyk partner advised developers to use URAs Guidelines For Developers on AML and CTF as a starting point. Developers should obtain legal advice early, to prevent or reduce exposure to criminal liability, he said.Whilst the measure comes with challenges, Mok underscored that the new AMLTF requirements will play an important signaling function in reinforcing the role of property developers as a bulwark against risks of misuse of the real estate market in Singapore for the purposes of money laundering and terrorism financing.Property developers play an integral front-line function because they deal directly with prospective purchasers and are best placed to monitor for suspicious transactions and illegitimate sources of funding. As such, regulators rely heavily on developers to keep the property market in Singapore free from funds derived from illicit activities, Mok said.By committing itself to the high standards set by FATF and clamping down on money launderers and terrorism financiers alike, Singapores financial system as a whole can boast stability and freedom from illicit fund flows, she added.As a parting shot, Leong said the implementation of the new requirements will help enhance the transparency of the real estate market in Singapore, serving to benefit both purchasers and developers."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Real estate consultant Ku Swee Yong weighs in.A general view of private homes in Singapore. (Photo: iStock/tobiasjo)SINGAPORE: The latest hikes in additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) for foreigners buying any residential property in Singapore, as well as for Singaporeans buying their second and subsequent houses, seem perplexing given sluggish macroeconomic conditions. This round of cooling measures, announced late Wednesday (Apr 26) night, came on the same day the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) macroeconomic review stated that global growth will slow over 2023, as monetary policy tightening by central banks worldwide takes full effect. In recent months, several Western banks have gone under and major investment houses are cautioning about an impending market crash and a recession. Given the headwinds expected by the investment market, interbank rates and the spreads heaped on borrowers will likely remain at todays levels or trend upwards.If, as MAS highlighted, banks start to tighten and are less willing to lend in view of market risks, then we may expect home loan rates in Singapore to remain above 3.5 per cent per annum for a longer time.We should also consider the increase in property taxes and high inflation rates etching away the rental returns of property investments. The increasing uncertainty in the jobs market as a result of downsizing by major corporations could also put pressure on occupancy rates.In the immediate term, foreign investors might give the residential market a miss and channel their funds to the office, retail and industrial segments even though rental returns at 2 to 4 per cent per annum are lower than commercial loan interest rates of 5 per cent or more.Perhaps the message to Singapore citizens is that the government is listening and actively responding to gripes about housing affordability. Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said the increases in ABSD are a pre-emptive measure to dampen local and foreign investor demand, while prioritising Singaporeans who are buying homes to live in.The previous rounds of cooling measures were rather recent, 17 months ago in December 2021 and seven months ago in September 2022. From a financial investment point of view, the raising of foreign buyers ABSD from 20 per cent to 30 per cent in December 2021 sounded steep. But somehow, that did not cool the market. Viewed from the same lens, it is difficult to imagine much interest from foreign investors after the new ABSD hike to 60 per cent. But for wealthy investors who do not care for financial returns, will the concept of ABSD work or will they act quickly to purchase more apartments just in case ABSD is raised further? Whether the additional taxes will cool the market is uncertain. Property players have already posted on social media urging investors to quickly purchase residential properties, before ABSD rates are adjusted even higher in future.It is worth noting that the April cooling measures did not address one major pain point for the residential segment: Persistently high rents, which affect not only people who have called Singapore home for years, but Singaporeans waiting for their new homes to be completed.But in a response to the media, Mr Lee said he does not see the latest ABSD adjustments having much spillover impact on rental markets.He cited the expected increase in supply for residential properties that is expected to cool down demand as some renters are expected to exit the rental markets to purchase their own property.The MAS macroeconomic review on Wednesday said home rental pressures may ease in the coming months as a significant supply of new housing units - almost 40,000 - will be completed across public and private housing markets in 2023.But until high rents are tamed, foreigners and Singaporeans alike will be griping about housing affordability and the lack of options. How the situation will unfold in a fragile economic environment would be interesting to observe.Ku Swee Yong is a director of real estate consulting firm International Property Advisor Pte Ltd and a researcher with the Singapore University of Social Sciences focused on autonomous vehicles and urban planning."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Singapores real estate sector will soon see a tightening of its customer and transaction due diligence requirements. From 28 June 2023, property developers will need to implement enhanced measures to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. This will include the requirement to conduct customer due diligence (CDD) checks on new and existing property purchasers. These requirements will be regulated under the Housing Developers (Control & Licensing) Act and Sale of Commercial Properties Act. These new rules have been put in place by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to tackle the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing in the real estate sector. It will be mandatory for developers to conduct due diligence checks on purchasers, notify purchasers (in the prescribed form) of the documents and information that developers must obtain, and keep proper records of these checks. If they suspect any money laundering or terrorism financing activity, developers will need to submit a report to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office of the Commercial Affairs Department. URA has stated that developers must consider various factors, such as whether the purchaser is from a country that is subject to increased monitoring, and screen them against lists in the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act and the United Nations Act. In addition, developers can also screen purchasers against other sources of information, such as public websites or third-party screening databases. There are several possible red flags that can indicate a suspicious transaction based on the purchasers profile and behaviour and transactional patterns. These red flags include:Purchasers profile and behaviourTransactional patterns Challenges faced by developers The new requirements may pose challenges to developers as they formulate strategies and frameworks to ensure that the checks they conduct are sound. For instance, developers may not have implemented screening systems yet. They may also face a shortage of trained personnel with sufficient knowledge to conduct screening or CDD, or to review screening hits. In addition, purchasing property to disguise the funds from illegal or criminal activities generally happens in the third (and final) stage of money laundering. Therefore, there will be some distance created between the original illegal proceeds and the eventual purchase, which will make it difficult for developers to draw links to money laundering. Developers may also be subject to conflicts of interest, as property agents may focus on the rewards of a successful transaction instead of the risks posed by potential buyers and disregard the screening hits. A multi-pronged approach to overcome these challengesThere are several actions that property developers should consider taking. Firstly, comprehensive and up to date policies and procedures to address financial crime should be implemented. A risk management framework should also be developed to enable developers to identify risks and introduce the required controls to manage them. The appointment of a screening vendor to aid in the detection of illicit activities should also be considered. In addition, training sessions should be conducted to ensure that staff understand the new requirements and how to implement them. Finally, developers should examine the need to commission an independent audit of their existing financial crime framework, with recommendations provided on how to strengthen them. Developers may engage third party firms, such as Deloitte, for support to overcome these challenges. For example, independent audit and assurance checks on the financial crime framework, implemented by the developer, can be performed to ensure that it is up to the required standard. The collection or remediation of CDD on property purchasers can also be performed by a third party by directly sourcing identifying information on the relevant parties. External firms can also support the requirement to screen customers against the specific lists as outlined in the Guidelines for Developers on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing, by assisting with vendor selection and/or performing quality assurance over the alert handling processes. Such screening checks can identify whether the screened individual or entity is a politically exposed person (PEP), terrorist, or designated (sanctioned) person, and whether there has been any adverse media coverage on the individual or entity.Independent system effectiveness testing on any tools or systems already used by the developer, to ensure that they are functioning effectively, can also be performed. This can provide assurance that the checks conducted are correctly identifying PEPs and/or designated (sanctioned) parties. External parties can also provide training on these new requirements, which include case studies and quizzes, to ensure that staff members understand their responsibilities and can effectively implement the firms updated controls. A proactive approach is keyWith the date of implementation of the new requirements fast approaching, property developers ought to be proactive in establishing a robust framework rather than take a reactive approach, given the strong impact enforcement can have on the business both financially and reputationally. A developers license to operate can be revoked in serious cases of non-compliance.The global anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), had previously cited deficiencies in Singapores due diligence requirements applicable to real estate, and the fact that record-keeping obligations for real estate were not provided by law. The Singapore government has therefore made it a priority to improve its requirements, with numerous regulations and circulars being introduced since 2018. With another FATF evaluation due for Singapore, the real estate sector should expect additional scrutiny and potential enforcement in these aspects. It is therefore of utmost importance that businesses operating in this sector understand their anti-money laundering obligations and update their internal control frameworks to reflect them. In addition, it would serve them well to implement these changes sooner rather than later."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

He added that geographic diversification will stand as a core strategy for investors in the region.In terms of asset classes, the expert has observed institutional capital cascading into alternative sectors like multifamily, senior living, and student housing. This shift underscores a strategic repositioning towards more lucrative avenues, he said.Apart from alternative assets, real estate barons are also looking into thematic investments on a global scale. Investors are increasingly drawn to narratives that align with overarching themes, fostering a strategic approach that extends beyond traditional market boundaries, Pilgrim said.Focus on ESG-compliant assets will also continue to 2024 as more investors see the value that these types of assets bring.ESG friendly assets are also likely to help drive rental growth in property sectors such as the industrial segment, said Catherine Chen, director for Asia Pacific Research at Cushman & Wakefield.Meanwhile, the flight-to-quality trend in the office and logistics sector will also push stakeholders to commit further towards addressing sustainability and climate change, said Christine Li, head of Research at Knight Frank Asia Pacific.Upturn for the marketNext year will also be a transformative time for the property market as it is expected to see higher transaction volumes on the back of the stabilisation of interest rates.Interest rate hikes have been one of the biggest challenges faced by investors and developers, with Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea being amongst the most adversely affected, said Chen.2023 has been one of the most volatile in recent history in terms of global interest rate rises and inflation, challenging for both the debt and equity investors across real estate asset classes, Pilgrim said.The expected stabilisation of interest rates will rejuvenate confidence within the debt markets, catalysing an upswing in lending and borrowing activities, he added.Li echoed this sentiment, adding that 2024 will mark an upturn for real estate investment markets in the APAC region.Odds for a soft landing that the Fed has been trying to engineer for its economy are getting better. Interest rates will peak as the Fed finally pauses on its extended rate hike cycle, which should allow bid-ask spreads to narrow and investment activity to rebound, Li said.Asia Pacific will remain the main engine of growth for the global economy, and as Chinas recovery gets on firmer ground, these conditions will continue to support the regions real estate sectors, she added.Office takes overIn terms of investment, offices rose as the most transacted asset class in the APAC region. Based on data from Cushman and Wakefield, the office sector accounted for 38% of transactions in the first semester of the year (1H23).Office demand in APAC also held up better than in the United States and Europe, given the stronger return-to-office trend in the region, said Li.With tech occupiers continuing to rationalise employee headcount, financial and professional services firms as well as flexible space operators have made up the slack in leasing activity, she said.Data from Knight Frank showed that office rents in the APAC region have continued to decline in 2023. As of 1H23, rents have declined by 1.8%.Martin Wong, director and head of Research & Consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, confirmed the slow leasing activity in the office market, saying the markets weak performance is due to the large supply available and the slow movement of investors amidst the high interest environment.Li had a similar sentiment, saying: The rise in funding cost and concerns over slowing economic growth has generally sparked more caution for developers as buyers are turning more selective in tandem.Office property landlords have reacted to the structural challenges brought on by hybrid working styles and a flight-to-quality trend as tenants focus on what it occupies rather than just how much, she added.Increasing allocation for industrialBehind office, the industrial sector was the second largest sector in APAC in terms of investment.Pilgrim said there has been a sustained uptick in capital allocation towards logistics assets in APAC.According to Chen, the share of industrial investment increased from a 10-year average of 17% (2013 to 2022), to 22% in 1H23.As a major logistics hub, Asia Pacific remains underserved by modern and high-quality logistics facilities, on the back of growing demand from a rising middle class, Chen said.Other driving forces of the industrial market include e-commerce and third-party logistics (3PL) players, as well as manufacturers, said Li.Whilst e-commerce demand is normalising, optimisation of the sectors logistics footprint has driven demand for modern facilities. Preference for institutional-grade facilities in core areas and last mile locations continued to fuel leasing activity in the region, whilst China+1 strategies also saw ongoing expansions by major manufacturers in Southeast Asia, Li said.The same was observed by Chen, adding that the China+1 strategy has driven interest for manufacturing and logistics assets in Southeast Asia.Retail remains relevantCompared to the industrial segment, the retail sector performed best in Singapore in terms of investment.Chen said retail investment accounted for over half of the total transaction volume in Singapore in 1H23.This was primarily led by a few large deals bought by Frasers and Link REIT, added Chen.Region-wide, Pilgrim said the retail sector in APAC displayed remarkable resilience and strength compared to other regions.It stands out with its consistent performance, boasting a streak of 12 months with stabilised yields, Pilgrim said.Respite for residentialLike retail, the residential sector, particularly in Hong Kong and Australia, is also receiving interest from investors.According to Pilgrim, there has been an increase in investment in the apartment subsector in Hong Kong and Australia. In 1H23, apartments accounted for 16% and 14% of total investment of the respective markets.Residential sales have also been performing quite well in Hong Kong as developers are becoming more aggressive to clear up their investors, said Knight Franks Wong.Many developers in the region are likewise trying to free up their investors left in the past two to three years, said Wong.On the buyer side, Li said they are taking advantage of the rate hikes being paused at the moment.Buyers are utilising this window of opportunity to lock down on their dream homes, she said.READ PART II HERE:Experts tout SGs strata commercial spaces an ideal investment choice;High interest rates stall foreign property deals in Hong Kong"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Today, homebuyers in the Lion City are no longer looking for just sanctuaries of rest, but are searching for hubs of productivity and recreation.Buyers are increasingly drawn to properties that embody the live, work, play ethos, where spaces seamlessly transform from workstations by day to leisure zones by night, Wu Chin Whee, senior manager for Livethere Residential at Savills, told the Singapore Business Review.Given the change in their lifestyles post-pandemic, Singaporeans also want to have an ability to customise their space, wanting homes that have expansive living areas, flexible spaces, and adaptable furniture.Green spacesApart from flexible homes, Singaporean homebuyers also prefer developments that offer green spaces.Eco-friendly elements such as enhanced indoor air quality, natural lighting and green spaces are well sought-after [by homebuyers], said Wu, adding that condominiums and HDB developments now have many sustainability features.Wu said the preference for developments with green space was driven by the Singaporeans heightened awareness of overall well-being and the tangible advantages that green spaces offer.As this consciousness deepens, sustainable attributes are now basic elements many would expect in a property development, he added.Donald Lin, senior associate director at OrangeTee & Tie, had a similar observation, saying a lot of developers are already incorporating greeneries within their properties.This actually enhances the homeowners lifestyle from their hectic work life. They see things like a sky garden, terraces with lots of greenery. These are places where the children or even seniors can relax, Lin, one of this years Real Estate Luminaries Under 40, said.Urban livingHomebuyers prefer being near the city, but they also want to enjoy the serenity offered by green landscapes, said Wu.Todays property buyers in Singapore prioritise a balanced lifestyle in their property choices. They are drawn to the vibrant pulse of urban living, said Wu.Properties near MRT stations, bus interchanges, shopping malls, F&B, and parks remain highly sought after. The proximity to good schools is also an important consideration for families aiming to provide the best educational opportunities for their children, Wu added.Lin echoed this sentiment, observing that a large number of homebuyers in Singapore are around 28 to 45 and are young families.[For] people within this category of demographics, their next concern is schools for their children so we see a lot of transactions in District 15 Katong and Dakota areas recently because there are many good schools there, Lin said.After location, Lin said, buyers look into how much privacy a development offers, citing LIV@MB as an example.LIV@MB has two towers of residential blocks whereby distances between the blocks are quite far away, he said.Buyers concernFeatures of a property is only one of the many factors that homebuyers consider when choosing a home.Wu said homebuyers would check whether or not there is capital gain from the property, as well as good projections for the rental yield.Prices, of course, are also a main consideration for buyers.Wu said mass-market private residential properties in the Outside Central Region (OCR) typically range from $1m to $2m. In the Rest of Central Region (RCR), average prices of units can go from $1.5m to $3m.Lin said price in relation to location also bears weight in the preference of homebuyers.We have recently seen a lot of transactions ongoing in the Core Central Region (CCR). Reason being there have been significant increments in pricing for the other regions such as the Rest of Central Region, whereas CCR has been maintaining relatively low [pricing] in the past 10 years, Lin said.The current attitude towards buying that a lot of my clients have in mind is, Since Im paying this X amount, why not go for something more premium since the difference is not that higher between regions, he explained.Its noteworthy that buyers can expect more returns from properties in the CCR in terms of rental yield and capital appreciation.Staying competitiveAs the real estate market becomes more competitive, Wu underscored that it will be important for agents, firms, and sellers in general to work on how they present their properties.Keep the property in immaculate condition and ensure it is decluttered to emphasise spaciousness. A freshly applied coat of neutral-toned paint can not only enhance the space, but also broaden its appeal to a diverse group of potential buyers, he said.He said sellers must also consider leveraging digital tools in property transactions.Investing in high-quality virtual tours and professional photography can elevate online listings, giving potential buyers an insight into the property from the comfort of their homes, Wu said.Additionally, a well-produced video walk-through offers a dynamic and immersive experience. By maintaining the property in impeccable condition and effectively utilising technology, sellers can stand out in this competitive market, attracting the attention of potential buyers, he added.Wu said sellers must also partner with trusted agents to ensure credible listing.Many buyers highlight the challenge of fake listings on portals, making searches tedious. Partnering with a trusted agent simplifies this journey, ensuring a targeted property selection without the hassle of numerous agents or irrelevant listings. The agents expertise is vital in tailoring choices that meet the buyers needs, he said.For his part, Lin advised sellers to proceed to transact, instead of wait longer, when the price is at or slightly higher than market value, so that they do not lose out on opportunities for their next purchase."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

District 8 accounted for 52.8% of the total transactions for 2Q23.Meanwhile, 999-year leasehold and freehold shophouses remained the preferred choice among investors for wealth preservation.Investors are less bothered with borrowing costs as they either pay in cash or borrow a small quantum, Huttons said.In 2H23, Huttons expects more activity in the shophouse market, with foreigners paying more attention to the segment.The Government introduced a set of control measures on land zoned for commercial and residential use on 20 July. Such land will now fall under the Residential Property Act and foreigners will require permission from the Singapore Land Authority for the purchase. An estimated 5% of shophouses are on land zoned for commercial and residential use, Huttons said.Almost all investors buy commercial zoned shophouses for the flexibility in use. Hence, there is limited impact on the shophouse market.

The Rest of Central Region (RCR) and Core Central Region (CCR) accounted for 31.7 per cent and 22.3 per cent respectively, in the second quarter of 2023.The proportion of non-landed private homes in the OCR has remained fairly stable over the past several years, from Q1 2017 to Q2 2023. Based on caveats from Jan 1, 2017 to Aug 22, 2023, 46.4 per cent of transactions are in mass market homes. OCR homes are favoured by HDB upgraders, due to buyers familiarity with the region as well as the affordable quantum.Thus, any significant change in transaction volume and prices in the OCR could have a profound effect on the property market. Ensuring a stable supply of non-landed homes and prices in the OCR is paramount for market stability.The government maintains stability in the property market through managing land supply, implementing cooling measures to curb buying and macroprudential measures that address financial system risk.When private home prices in the OCR shot up 8.7 per cent in the first half of 2018, measures such as the increase in Additional Buyers Stamp Duty (ABSD) and tighter Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV) were rolled out to tame prices. Property prices in the OCR eased by 0.1 per cent the quarter immediately after Q3 2018 and grew more sustainably in subsequent quarters. Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.When property prices went out of sync with economic fundamentals in 2021, 2022 and 2023, further loan tightening measures such as a lower Total Debt Servicing Ratio and higher medium-term interest rate floor were announced, in addition to higher ABSD. In December 2021, the government also announced that it would ramp up housing supply to meet demand.The en bloc cycle which started in 2017 and slowed down in 2018 greatly increased the supply of private residential dwelling units for development in the OCR by an estimated 10,000 in these two years. The bigger developments sold in 2017 and 2018 were Florence Regency, Park West, Rio Casa, Serangoon Ville and Tampines Court. These were rebuilt into mega projects: the 1,410-unit The Florence Residences, 1,468-unit Parc Clematis, 1,472-unit Riverfront Residences, 1,052-unit Affinity at Serangoon and 2,203-unit Treasures at Tampines.Subsequently, the government reduced the supply of private residential dwelling units from sites offered under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme by an estimated 50 per cent. Land for an average of around 1,200 units a year was released in 2018 and 2019, from more than 2,500 units in 2017. Between 2017 and 2020, land sales from the en bloc market and under the GLS programme ensured a steady supply of new private homes launched for sale in the OCR, in the range of 4,000 to 5,000 units a year. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic injected unprecedented uncertainty in the economy, and the government further cut the supply of private residential dwelling units in the OCR under the GLS programme to 680 in 2020. This was probably the lowest level on record.When the economy grew strongly by 7.6 per cent in 2021, demand for homes returned with a vengeance. The severe undersupply of new homes met with a strong recovery in demand, creating the conditions for a perfect storm. Private property prices in the OCR surged by 8.8 per cent in 2021 and 9.3 per cent in 2022. This prompted new rounds of cooling measures in December 2021 and September 2022. To meet the increased demand, the government ramped up the supply of OCR land under the GLS programme in 2021 by 134 per cent to an estimated 1,590 private residential dwelling units. OCR land supply was bumped up by another 76 per cent in 2022, to 2,790 units. In 2023, supply of OCR land in the GLS reached a 10-year high of 3,455 units. As there is a time lag of at least 12 months from the sale of a land parcel to the launch of the project for sale, the number of private residential units launched for sale in the OCR fell significantly and hit a low of just 1,669 in 2022. This was a result of low land sales during the pandemic.The increase in land supply in the OCR in 2021 and H1 2022 brought more launches in 2023. Between Jan 1 and Sep 4, 2023, an estimated 1,716 new private homes have been launched for sale in the OCR. Another 500-odd units in the OCR may be offered for sale in Q4 2023. Upcoming launches may include Hillhaven, Hillock Green and Jden. Hillhaven is a 341-unit project in the Hillview private residential enclave and is just minutes walk to Hillview MRT station. Hillock Green is a 474-unit project in the upcoming Lentor private residential enclave and is opposite a shopping mall and Lentor MRT station. Jden, in the heart of Singapores second Central Business District, is a redevelopment of the former JCube and houses 368 units. These may bring the total number of launched units in the OCR to an estimated 2,307 in 2023. While this is higher than 2022s 1,669 units, it is still much lower than 2021s 2,951 units and the annual average of 4,000 to 5,000 units from 2017 to 2020.The increase in supply however is coming against a backdrop of slower sales for recent launches.Mass market homes tend to see more demand from HDB upgraders. But the number and proportion of buyers with an HDB address has declined in recent years. Buyers with an HDB address made up almost 50 per cent of new sales in 2017. Based on caveated transactions as at Aug 22, 2023, this has come down to 20.5 per cent. A similar trend was also observed for the RCR and CCR.The key turning point was probably when the government raised ABSD to 17 per cent for a second property on Dec 16, 2021. Including the downpayment of 25 per cent and stamp duty of 4 per cent, HDB upgraders will have to cough up close to 50 per cent of the purchase price in cash and/or Central Provident Fund monies when they buy a new private home. It was previously easier for many to sell their flat and rent or stay with parents or relatives in the interim. But the Covid-19 pandemic upended these plans. Rents spiked with a crunch in supply of available flats for rent, as work-from-home routines took hold and households required more space. One alternative is to buy a new executive condominium (EC) unit. But EC projects have strict qualifying conditions, and many HDB upgraders do not qualify. This current market friction is not ideal and will constrain upward housing mobility in the long run. It may also affect the stability in the mass market segment. It is perhaps timely to review the ABSD on HDB upgraders as the nation refreshes its social compact.Lee Sze Teck is senior director of data analytics and Mark Yip is chief executive at Huttons Asia"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Some investors already see this as a strategic move to sidestep the more obvious jitters.According to Samuel Rhee, co-founder, chairman and chief investment officer of Endowus, high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) are putting greater emphasis on these types of assets.Rhee said accredited investors in Singapore and professional investors in Hong Kong have also been diversifying into private markets and alternatives, which is underutilised by investors in both cities.The systematic harvesting of illiquidity premiums coupled with the fact that companies are staying private for longer and the structural growth of private credit that is disintermediating the banks allows for greater opportunities to be had for investors in this space, Rhee told the Singapore Business Review and Hong Kong Business magazines.Currently, Rhee said investors are still underweight in private markets such as private equity and private credit.The latter, however, has become more appealing to Asian investors. Citing data from Preqin, Rhee said the Asian private credit market has surged from US$3.2b of assets under management (AUM) in 2000 to US$90b as of June, 2022.As the Asia Pacific market matures, Preqin foresees accelerated growth in the Asian private credit market.Altas head of Private Capital Markets, Muzahir Degani, also agrees that private credit will remain an attractive asset class.Public or publicly listed credit [usually] receives a relatively smaller spread over the risk free rate, which, to some extent, youre not very well covered in terms of inflation, Degani said in a separate interview. With private credit, the spread that were seeing today gives investors yields that are easily in the high single digit or mid-teens level of returns.Ben Charoenwong, assistant professor of finance at the National University of Singapore Business School (NUS), said lending in the private credit market or distressed private equity vehicles may provide opportunities for investors within a rising interest environment given that more borrowers have obligations due and require financing.Although risk-taking appetite may subside going forward, there are still good deals to be found in private markets as the monetary, fiscal, and political situations around the world take a toll on the real economy, Charoenwong told the Singapore Business Review.Apart from private credit, private capital and private equity also offer great opportunities for investors, said Degani.Looking at valuations in the private equity market, high growth tech companies have fallen quite significantly over the last 12 to 18 months. Were able to pick up very good companies that have actually performed well over this sort of funding downturn within private equity and high-growth tech at very reasonable valuations compared to the height of the market, he said.As a case in point, Degani cited names like Stripe which, he said, ostensibly did an extremely significant down round sometime in the middle of this year.It was almost half the valuation of its peak in 2021, he said. If you look at the numbers [of Stripe], its actually grown more than two times over that period. Youre arguably getting twice the quality of the company at half the valuation.In terms of markets in the private capital space, Indonesia and Thailand stand out, said Degani.Select companies within the private capital space that are coming out from these markets are extremely strong. Well be keeping an eye out for attractive opportunities in Indonesia and Thailand, he said.Alternatives: Real estate, commodities, and hedge fundsLooking at alternative assets and investments, WRISE Wealth Management Singapore chief investment strategist, Cheng Jingwei, has identified real estate, commodities, and hedge funds as high risk-reward instruments.Multi-strategy hedge funds, in particular, have consistently generated solid risk-adjusted returns through recent cycles, said Rhee.Market neutral, low beta multi-strategy hedge funds have also generated meaningfully positive returns consistently and these returns shine brighter in periods of market dislocation and drawdowns as we have seen in the past few years, added the Endowus executive.Charoenwong, for his part, said there are likely bargains and opportunities that hedge funds can capture, albeit, a risky strategy.As the yield curve steepens, there are also effects on securities where cash flows lie far out into the future, said the Singapore-based professor.He also finds commodities as a good short-term hedge for rising prices. Oil prices have risen up to almost US$90 a barrel again. However, it is worth noting that although commodities may provide tactical benefit, they are generally not good long-term investments, Charoenwong said.One to agree that commodities are a popular asset class is Jingwei, who has observed this among WRISE clients. Talking about real estate, Jingwei said APAC investors have traditionally focused on such asset classes which offer a potential for high returns.Jingwei, however, warned that real estate also carries more liquidity risks in a higher interest rate environment. Rhee, for his part, said investors are still underweight in private real estate.In the latest property issue of the Singapore Business Review, real estate experts revealed that investors, particularly foreigners, should consider strata commercial spaces as an investment.The control in future approvals for new strata subdivision ensures that the supply of such commercial spaces remains limited, which can potentially drive up rental yields and capital appreciation, Tang Wei Leng, managing director and head of Capital Markets & Investment Services at Colliers Singapore, said in an interview.Investing in strata CBD commercial space in Singapore offers local investors the opportunity to leverage their knowledge of the domestic market, and benefit from the continued growth of Singapore's business landscape, Tang added.Overall, Degani said real estate is a good inflation hedge because of its steady stream of incomes, and is even a better hedge for inflation than gold.Healthcare and renewablesAnother sector which investors should consider dipping their toes into are healthcare and renewables and sustainability.Charu Chanana, market strategist at Saxo, said there are opportunities in the healthcare sector given the ageing society.Charoenwong raised the same point, adding that the United States and counties in North Asia are also seeing ageing populations.The NUS expert identified telemedicine, new technological developments in biomedicine, and wellness as areas of opportunities.Charoenwong and Degani also pointed to companies and technologies involved in sustainability as a good investment, especially those working on the renewable energy sector and general carbon mitigation.These include electric vehicles, businesses related to smart grids and storage technologies, and carbon capture, Charoenwong said.More than electric vehicles, Degani said the whole electrification of the transport network offers investment opportunities for investors.No matter how the short-term market moves, Charoenwong said healthcare and sustainability sectors and related businesses will continue to grow.Fixed Income, Asian equities and bondsShould interest rates fall, Rhee said fixed income would be an attractive option.According to Saxos Chanana, the turn in the monetary policy cycle will likely to arrive in early 2024 which could eventually bring a significant respite for the Asian economies.A falling interest rate environment, when it comes, will be a big boon to the fixed income sectors, Rhee said. In a falling interest rate environment, the high yield and credit markets in fixed income will come back strongly and equity markets in general should do well, he added.Fixed income is something that family offices have been paying more attention to, according to Jingwei.Rhee, for his part, observed that fixed income has also become more appealing to Asian investors.Asian investors also prefer to invest in Asian equities and bonds, said Jingwei.Whilst the current valuations for Asian equities and bonds are favourable, more concrete developments in market sentiment and economic stimulus in China are necessary to bolster confidence in the potential for meaningful capital gains in the upcoming year,\" added Jingwei.Charoenwong has a similar sentiment, saying that Asian stocks appear cheap relative to the United States. Such pricing has historically correlated with relatively better returns going forward, the NUS professor said.Money market funds and cash fundsIn a volatile market, keeping a significant portion of assets in cash or cash equivalents can be a reasonable choice; however, Endowus Rhee pointed out that investors can get better returns on cash allocations by investing in money market funds and cash funds.Goldman Sachs defines a money market fund as a mutual fund that invests in short term debt securities.These funds allow investors to participate in a more liquid, diverse and high-quality portfolio than if they were to invest individually, the investment bank stated, adding that it is the easiest way to gain access to the money markets.Forbes named JPMorgan Liquid Assets Money Market Fund, T. Rowe Price Government Money Fund, and BlackRock Wealth Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund Investor amongst the 10 best money market mutual funds of December, 2023.According to Rhee, money market funds and cash funds yield higher rates over fixed deposits.Charoenwong said investors have been piling into market funds as well, adding that they appear to yield more short-term gains. But he notes that if the economy takes a turn, then central banks can cut interest rates quickly and investors in money market funds may suddenly see their yields fall.Investment strategiesApart from considering the 10 investments above, experts said the most important thing for investors to do, regardless of environment, is diversification.Risk management remains important while investing in Asia or other emerging markets, and portfolio diversification remains key, Chanana said.Charoenwong said investors will specifically benefit from diversification across geographies and industries.This way, if some policy change affects one industry-market in a negative way, there are likely spillover winners elsewhere. For example, the US-China tension results in more American companies moving their supply chains into Southeast Asia, improving returns in the latter markets even if the returns in the Chinese market deteriorate, Charoenwong said.In addition to the standard tools like diversifying across securities within a market, investors may want to focus on diversifying their risks across more dimensions, like industry and geographies. Investors who do not prefer to move allocations into and out of the market rapidly may consider incorporating cross-asset hedges to manage certain types of risks, such as those from currency and interest rate movements, the NUS professor added.Rhee, for his part, advised investors to consider adopting a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy as a passive investment approach through a downturn.He defined DCA as periodic, recurring investments of a fixed amount of money into a specific asset.Investors can either have a total investment amount in mind or have an ongoing investment as a savings plan. DCA removes any emotional and behavioural mistakes and minimises market timing risk, he explained.As such, investors, particularly those with a lower risk tolerance, are less likely to make impulsive, speculative decisions based on personal opinions or market conditions, he added.A DCA approach also allows investors to purchase more shares at lower prices whilst remaining positioned for an eventual market rebound, Rhee said.WRISEs Jingwei, meanwhile, suggested implementing a barbell strategy, especially for APAC investors.A barbell strategy involves allocating a portion of your assets into lower volatility instruments such as short-duration treasuries and high-quality corporate credit to secure a stable return as well as to keep the portfolio liquid, Jingwei explained.In addition to adopting a barbell strategy, Jingwei also advised investors to steer clear of long-duration fixed-income investments due to the potential volatility in interest rates.Whilst experts suggest good investments or strategies, Charoenwong underscored that investors should avoid investing into something just because others have mentioned it, particularly if the investors themselves do not have any advantage in a particular investment, citing artificial intelligence as an example.Given current market conditions, investing in AI stocks may not yield good returns going forward based on the high current valuations already. The financial markets have focused a lot on the development of AI, but they may have mispriced the relevance of AI as a general purpose tool for other types of companies as well, Charoenwong said.He concluded with an important reminder for investors: Good returns are not about whether you invest in a growing company.It is whether you invest in a company whose performance is better than the market expects. Therefore, when considering allocating a particular way, it is worthwhile asking ourselves what our beliefs are that differ from the market to justify higher-than-market returns, he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The rental occupancy cap will be relaxed temporarily between Jan 22, 2024, and Dec 31, 2026, to better meet rental demand, said HDB and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Wednesday (Dec 20).It will apply to four-room and larger HDB flats, living quarters of HDB commercial properties where the living space is at least equivalent to a four-room flat, and private residential properties of at least 90 square metres. HDB and URA noted that any extension of the relaxed occupancy cap beyond 2026 will be subject to review, based on the open market situation then.Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said in a Facebook post that the sharp increase in residential rents was largely led by strong demand amid Covid-19 construction delays.He noted that the government (anticipates) the need to maintain a healthy rental supply to support those looking to rent.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.To mitigate this, we ramped up housing supply with close to 100,000 homes expected to be completed by 2025, he said. He added that the increased supply of new homes will allow Singaporeans renting while awaiting project completions to vacate their rental units sooner, further freeing up rental supply.This temporary measure will only apply to larger properties, which can accommodate more occupants with minimal impact on those around them, in order to maintain a conducive living environment for the larger community.We will monitor the situation closely and take action against any infringements or serious disamenities, including revoking the homeowners rental approval, Lee added.Residential property owners who currently house up to six unrelated persons will need to apply to HDB for owners of HDB flats, or to URA for owners of private residential properties to include additional occupants.Private property owners can do so by registering their properties through URAs e-services with a S$20 administrative fee. Upon successful registration, the owner will be informed that they can use the residential property to accommodate up to eight unrelated persons, each subject to a minimum stay duration of three consecutive months, said the agencies.The current rule for HDB flat owners, as well as HDB commercial property owners and tenants, to get HDBs approval before the tenancy commencement date, still applies.Applications to rent out HDB flats or bedrooms may be submitted online via HDBs e-services, said the board, noting that an administrative fee is payable with each application, at S$10 per bedroom or S$20 per whole flat rented out.HDB commercial property owners and tenants who wish to rent out their living quarters can apply via the GoBusiness Licensing Portal. The administrative fee is S$100 per application, it added.Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at PropNex, agreed that the temporary relaxation of the occupancy cap, on top of the progressive completion of private homes, should help to foster the healthy leasing demand in the near term.She also expects that long-stay serviced apartments, once ready, will further cater to those in need of transitional housing.While analysts agreed that budget-conscious tenants can now pay less by sharing with more roommates, they had mixed views on the measures impact on the rental market. OrangeTee & Tie noted that the new measure may affect more than 60 per cent of the HDB rental market, and is expected to benefit lower-income groups, students, blue-collar foreign workers, some Singaporeans and big families.The real estate agency also noted that the change may bring some challenges to landlords owning smaller homes. The overall rental volume may drop slightly due to fewer units being leased, as bigger units can now accommodate more people.Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, said: On the upside, the resale prices of bigger condos and HDB flats may climb higher, especially older units, noting the potentially higher rental demand for the bigger units.Meanwhile, Huttons expects rents to face downward pressure in the short term while rental supply catches up. But it highlighted that the impact on rents should not be significant, as it is a short-term fix to stabilise the market situation. On the other hand, Lee Nai Jia, head of real estate intelligence of data and software solutions at PropertyGuru, said that the impact on market is indeterminate as the listing supply may rise correspondingly while enhanced affordability increases demand.Asking rents for the whole unit may rise in the short term, even though each individual renter pays less. That said, we expect the impact to be limited to some segments of market, said Lee.Analysts also had differing opinions on how the new ruling would affect other stakeholders besides tenants. Eugene Lim, key executive officer of ERA Singapore, noted that companies employing many foreign workers will benefit from the measure as they will require fewer rental units to house their staff.But Savills Singapores executive director of research and consultancy Alan Cheong highlighted that the measure will affect the HDB market more than the private segment, due to stronger demand for HDB rentals from S Pass holders. The private market is less impacted because even if rents fall by 20 per cent,the rents are still beyond reach of these S Pass holders, he said.However, the one common point arising from this is that landlords who increase their tenancy headcount will end up paying higher property taxes.Nicholas Mak, chief research officer of property search portal Mogul.sg, highlighted that while residential landlords could benefit by subdividing their rental unit to squeeze in more tenants, relevant risks such as fire hazards and hygiene issues might arise.The authorities must conduct surprise inspections of such subdivided units in both private and HDB properties, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

In comparison, rates for non-landed residential use rose 0.1 per cent on average after being cut by an average of 3.2 per cent for the previous revision period from Sept 1, 2023 to Feb 29, 2024, according to JLL.Mogul.sgs chief research officer Nicholas Mak said the discrepancy is due to the assessed land values of landed homes rising faster than those of non-landed residential properties, partly as a result of conservative bids in some state land tenders.Knight Franks Mr Tay noted that the increases in LBC rates for non-landed properties were in areas such as Clementi, where a government land sale (GLS) site in Clementi Avenue 1 was awarded at $1,250 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr), and Toa Payoh, where a plot in Lorong 1 was awarded at $1,360 psf ppr. Both parcels were awarded in November 2023.In the Orchard Road area, some sectors saw steep declines due in part to the award of the Orchard Boulevard GLS site in February 2024 at a land rate of $1,617 psf ppr, which is 24 per cent lower than the land value implied from the Sept 1, 2023 rate, JLLs Ms Tay noted.Analysts also attributed these LBC rate declines to the cooling measures taking a toll on foreign buyers and investors, who tend to be attracted to prime district properties. The substantial drop in LBC rates in several Orchard Road sectors is, however, unlikely to revitalise residential collective sales in this area, given the punitive Additional Buyers Stamp Duty rates for foreign buyers, which stands at 60 per cent, Mr Tay said.In addition to the gulf between sellers price expectations and developers low risk appetites, the increases in LBC rates in several sectors in the fringe and suburban areas ranging between 2.8 per cent and 14 per cent would make the en bloc sale market even more challenging, he added.JLLs Ms Tay expects developers will be more guarded in their land banking, especially in areas where LBC rates have been raised.Developers land banking will continue to be restrained by the cooling measures and development risks that are compounded by economic headwinds, elevated interest rates, high construction costs and an ample pipeline supply of new homes, she added.Meanwhile, LBC rates for industrial use grew 1.7 per cent. Those for hotels and hospitals use inched up 0.7 per cent on average, with the rate increases largely in the CBD and Orchard areas, where hotels have benefited from demand from leisure and business travellers, said Ms Tricia Song, CBREs head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia.LBC rates will remain unchanged for place of worship/civic and community institution use. Also left untouched are the rates for the other use groups covering open space/nature reserve, agriculture, and drains/roads/railways. LBC rates for commercial use increased by 3.8 per cent on average, up from a 0.4 per cent rise in the previous revision, which could dampen sentiment for commercial collective sales in the near term, Ms Song said.Investors picked up pricier assets with a substantial commercial component as evidenced by a surge in average deal size to $64 million in the period between Sept 1, 2023 and Feb 29, 2024, from $37 million in the preceding six-month period, JLLs Ms Tay said.The sectors that attracted top increases in LBC rates were largely in Orchard Road and the Central Business District, and were likely due to the commercial collective sales of Far East Shopping Centre for $910 million in September 2023 and Shenton House for $538 million in November 2023."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Caveats were filed for just 15 transactions that quarter, compared with 37 deals between July and September. In terms of transaction value, the dealsvalued at $95 million from October to December 2023 represented a 70 per cent plunge from nearly $321 million recorded in the same period in 2022. This is the lowest quarterly sales based on transaction data since 2010, noted a report by property agency PropNex released on Jan 19.The year on the whole saw a notable slowdown in the once-bustling commercial shophouse market, with 131 shophouses worth about $1.14 billion changing hands. This is down from 191 deals worth $1.6 billion in 2022.This is the lowest sales volume achieved in a year since 2019, when 123 shophouses fetched a total of $916 million.PropNex head of research and content Wong Siew Ying said there were fewer big-ticket acquisitions in the final quarter of 2023. She attributed the lacklustre performance to a combination of factors, including a soft economic outlook and heightened due diligence following the anti-money laundering blitz. At least 10 foreigners have been arrested in what is one of Singapores largest anti-money laundering operations, where $2.8 billion in cash and assets were seized.Meanwhile, the market slowdown also means that owners who were initially confident about price hikes earlier in the year are now more open to negotiation, property agents told The Straits Times. Mr Richard Tan, founder ofPropNex Shophouse Elites, which specialises in the shophouse market, said many owners raised their prices after the last round of property cooling measures in April 2023. The higher additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) rates on residential propertiesdrove investors interest to the commercial shophouse market.Currently, Singaporeans would have to pay an ABSD rate of 20 per cent when buying their second residential property, and 30 per cent for subsequent properties.Permanent residents pay 30 per cent ABSD on their second residential property and 35 per cent for subsequent properties. Foreigners bear the brunt of the new measures as they now have to pay a rate of 60 per cent when buying any residential property, up from 30 per cent.Mr Tan said many foreigners see commercial shophouses as a safe haven to park their wealth. After the money laundering crackdown, we saw fewer foreign buyers. Owners did not immediately drop their asking prices, he added. For months, both owners and buyers adopted a wait-and-see approach. But after a long lull period and a notable drop in transaction volumes, some owners are now more open to negotiation.Mr Tan gave an example of a freehold five-storey shophouse in the Upper Circular Road conservation area. The owner had asked for $40 million, but the highest offer received was $35 million. Both owner and buyer have proceeded to discuss the terms and conditions of the sale, he said. But there are still some owners who are firm on their asking prices as the leasing market is good and they are not in a hurry to sell, he added. District 8 (Little India and Jalan Besar) dominated shophouse sales in 2023 with 44 transactions, the PropNex report noted, citing caveat data. This significantly surpassed the next most popular area, District 14 (Geylang and Eunos), where 18 deals were done in the year. The top transaction in the last three months of 2023 was the sale of a 999-year leasehold four-storey shophouse in Serangoon Road for $18.5 million in November. Caveats were not lodged for several transactions in prime locations in Districts 1 and 2, PropNex noted. There were fewer transactions in the final quarter of 2023 by foreigners, who typically avoid lodging caveats to keep their identities private, market observers said. Caveats are lodged by buyers with the Singapore Land Authority to publicly assert their legal or financial interest in a property, but the process is not mandatory. Meanwhile, leasing activity remained resilient, driven by a recovery in tourism. Monthly median rents bounced back to $6.39 per sq ft for the months of October to December 2023, from $5.98 psf in the previous three months. A positive turn in market conditions will bode well for occupiers, especially those in the F&B (food and beverage), retail and accommodation segments, Ms Wong said. For the whole of 2023, the shophouse leasing market registered 3,660 transactions totalling $37.9 million, eclipsing the 3,589 transactions worth $34.3 million in 2022. Ms Wong anticipates steady demand for shophouses in 2024, supported by their limited supply, heritage value and potential for capital growth. The projection is further bolstered by expectations of interest rate cuts in 2024 and continued improvements in the tourism sector, she added.

SIPMM executive director Stephen Poh said: The new year augurs well for the manufacturing sector as it remains on the expansion track for the fifth month, despite the ongoing geopolitical risks.Local manufacturers face slower supplier deliveries due to disruptions in global supply chains, which in turn affect production downtime. However, they are cautiously optimistic of manufacturing growth for the new year.Januarys overall PMI reading was attributed to a faster expansion of new orders, new exports and input purchases. Faster expansion rates were also recorded for the indexes of finished goods, imports, input prices, order backlog and future business.But the reading was dragged down by slower growth in factory output and employment. In addition, the supplier deliveries index posted its eighth month of continuous contraction, possibly exacerbated by the disruptions from the Red Sea conflict, said UOB associate economist Jester Koh. Professor Lawrence Loh, director at the National University of Singapore Business Schools Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said the latest PMI shows a sturdy momentum of economic performance, but said some uncertainties remain in critical areas like employment and factory output. The electronics sector PMI reading for January was attributed to a faster expansion rate in the indexes of electronic new orders, new exports, employment and input purchases.UOBs Mr Koh noted that the future business index for the sector also improved, possibly supported by a boost in demand for chips and electronic parts for data centres, driven by the trends in artificial intelligence and cloud computing. But electronics firms also saw a contraction in factory output, which suggests a potential setback that needs to be closely watched in tandem with a decline in supplier delivery, said OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling. Given the tensions in the Red Sea, it is possible that further delays in supplier deliveries could become a potential chokepoint if unresolved. At this juncture, geopolitical uncertainties continue to exert an influence on global supply chain recalibrations, she added.The overall January PMI supports analyst views that better prospects are in store for manufacturing in 2024, said DBS Bank economist Chua Han Teng, who warned that the factory improvement is likely to be gradual and fragile. The global economic environment remains uncertain, due to high interest rates in advanced economies, bumpy recovery in China and lingering geopolitical tensions that could still disrupt supply chains, he said. He noted that the electronics cluster is turning around alongside the global semiconductor cycle, adding: Yet the recovery appears choppy, with electronics factory production still yet to enter into sustained expansion, even as the contraction is modest and not as weak as in mid-2023. UOBs Mr Koh said the year-on-year recovery in industrial production in 2024 will be partly driven by base effects, given the downturn in 2023. He also noted that export demand in the first half of 2024 remains subdued given high interest rates in the United States and Europe and the ongoing effects of Chinas property market downturn, although a broader recovery in manufacturing could emerge around mid-2024."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This was the highest annual value recorded under the GLS programme since 2012, when 51 GLS sites worth $10.6 billion were awarded, according to a report released by real estate firm Knight Frank on Jan 3. Public-sector transaction values in 2023 were up nearly 40 per cent from 2022, when 11 sites amounting to $5.5 billion were sold. Two large 99-year leasehold GLS sites in Tampines Avenue 11 and Marina Gardens Lane crossed the $1 billion mark in 2023, despite elevated interest rates and development risks.Residential deals, comprising largely state land sales, formed the bulk of total investment sales activity in Singapore in 2023, totalling $10.3 billion. This was, however, down 13.3 per cent from $11.9 billion in 2022 because of higher interest rates and increased additional buyers stamp duty rates from April 2023, said the Knight Frank report.As a result, total investment sales fell 31.8 per cent to $21.1 billion in 2023, from $30.9 billion in 2022, crimped by a drop in residential and commercial property deals, the report said. While investment activity slowed in 2023, the number of public deals transacted and their value increased as the Government launched more sites and raised residential housing supply to address demand, Knight Frank said.The commercial and residential site in Tampines Avenue 11 was the largest GLS deal in 2023 awarded at $1.21 billion, or $885 per sq ft (psf) per plot ratio, to a joint venture between a UOL-Singapore Land consortium and CapitaLand Development.In second place was the GLS site in Marina Gardens Lane, which was awarded to Chinese developer Kingsford Huray Development and two other partners for $1.03 billion, or $1,402 psf per plot ratio. This site, which can yield 790 residential units and up to 8,073 sq ft of commercial space, will be the first to kick-start development of the 45ha Marina South precinct.The attractive sites released under the GLS programme diverted attention from the residential collective sale market. That, along with a mismatch in price expectations between developers and sellers in the market as well as heightened development risks, resulted in just seven collective sale deals totalling $2.1 billion in 2023.That is a 44 per cent drop from 2022, when 16 such deals worth $3.8 billion were concluded, the report said. Following the $392.2 million collective sale of Meyer Park in Marine Parade in the first quarter of 2023, subsequent deals shrank in price quantum and number. That was due in part to the April round of cooling measures, and because the higher cost of replacement homes pushed sellers to set reserve prices that were deemed too high by developers, said Knight Frank.Other residential sites acquired en bloc by developers in 2023 includedKew Lodge in Kheam Hock Road for $66.8 million in May and Kartar Apartments in Thomson Road for $18 million in October.Ms Chia Mein Mein, head of capital markets for land and collective sale at Knight Frank, said: Small residential plots remain attractive to developers. Landed home plots for redevelopment are also sought by boutique developers. Elsewhere, commercial investment sales plunged 61.4 per cent to $6.1 billion, from $15.8 billion in 2022, according to Knight Frank. Even so, several large deals were inked, including the $1 billion acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Nex shopping centre in Serangoon Central by Frasers Centrepoint Trust and Frasers Property.Commercial sales also got a fillip from the $908 million collective sale of Far East Shopping Centre, a mixed-use project in Orchard Road with retail and office components, to a company linked to Chinese businessman Du Shuanghua in September. In November, Shenton House in the Central Business District was sold to IOI Properties Group for $538 million.Property consultant Cushman & Wakefield said that despite the headwinds, strata offices, strata retail and shophouses, which have smaller price quantums, should see continued interest in 2024 owing to resilient demand from private wealth investors.Niche investments, such as co-living and student accommodation, are seeing an uptick in interest as investors look for uncrowded sectors that have lower competition and potentially higher returns, it added.Cushman & Wakefield research head Wong Xian Yang expects Singapore real estate investment sales to pick up if US interest rates are cut significantly in 2024. But the recovery may be gradual, as the magnitude and timing of interest rate cuts remain uncertain, he said.Developers are expected to remain cautious in land banking because take-up rates of new private homes have slowed in the face of higher prices and elevated interest rates, and after more new launches hit the market in 2023. Larger new launches of projects with at least 100 units were, on average, 53 per cent sold in 2023. While this is slower than the 2022 new-launch average take-up of 73 per cent, it is higher than 2019s performance of about 23 per cent sold, Mr Wong said.As such, developers bids will likely be tempered by the continued ramp-up in supply in state land sales, slowing private housing price growth and intensified competition for home buyers as more new launches come on stream in 2024, he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The properties estimated by observers to be valued at more than $100 million combined were separately bought under Singapore-incorporated companies Jiasheng Amoy and Suyh wholly owned by Mr Su Binghai and Mr Su Fuxiang, respectively.Checks by The Sunday Times in December 2023 found that both men, who are of interest to the police, left Singapore abruptly amid the anti-money laundering probe in 2023. Information from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) showed that DBS placed both firms into receivership in September 2023, after the owners failed to make debt payments.DBS declined to comment when asked about the factors that led it to place the two firms into receivership. The banks probe into the loans started in 2022, soon after the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) launched investigations into a former Citibank employee for forgery-related offences in October 2021, and before a massive islandwide blitz led by the CAD that involved more than 400 officers.The Government in October 2023 revealed that money laundering investigations had started in 2021, after the authorities became aware of the use of suspected forged documents to substantiate sources of funds in bank accounts in Singapore.Mr Martin Wong of FTI Consulting was appointed as the receiver of both firms. On Dec 1, 2023, FTI placed three separate advertisements in The Business Times, calling for expression of interest for 10 shophouses in Telok Ayer Street (one unit), Amoy Street (four units) and Geylang Road (five units). BT reported on Jan 26 that three adjoining shophouses at 4, 5 and 6 Stanley Street in Chinatown, owned by Aalto Group, have also been put up for sale by tender at a guiding price of $61.6 million. Aalto Group, a holding company whose sole director is Mr Su Fuxiang, has been placed in receivership and Knight Frank Singapore is marketing the units on behalf of the receiver, KPMG Services, appointed by DBS in September 2023. A mortgage under DBS was lodged in 2021. When contacted, Mr Wong of FTI declined to comment on the receivership or status of the properties, citing confidentiality.Regrettably, this is confidential information, which I am not at liberty to share, save that interest in these properties exceeded my expectations, he told ST.Market observers said about 30 parties submitted offers for the 10 shophouse units listed by FTI before the deadline on Jan 15, 2024. A property title search showed that in 2021, Jiasheng Amoy bought the 999-year leasehold three-storey unit at 182 Telok Ayer Street and four adjoining units of two-storey shophouses from 55 to 58 Amoy Street.Mr Su Binghai is the sole director and shareholder of Jiasheng Amoy, according to Acra records. ST reported in December 2023 that he was found to have business dealings with Cypriot national Wang Dehai, who is originally from China and has been charged with money laundering here. Wang is a wanted man in China over his alleged links to an online gaming syndicate. Singapore Land Authority records showed that Suyh bought the five adjoining units at 236 to 244 Geylang Road in 2021.Mr Su Fuxiang, an associate of Mr Su Binghai, is the sole director and shareholder of Suyh, Acra records showed. The units in Geylang are occupied by a coffee shop, a hairdressing salon, a Chinese restaurant and a tattoo shop.An employee at the Chinese restaurant said he was not aware that the property had been put up for sale. A Korean restaurant Oven & Fried Chicken currently occupies the unit in Telok Ayer Street, while fashion retailer Little Match Girl occupies units 55 and 56 in Amoy Street. The other two units are currently vacant.Mr Can Heng, who runs Little Match Girl, said he renewed his tenancy for another three years from 2023. He declined to say whether he had done so before or after he was informed of the receivership in 2023.The owner of a Vietnamese restaurant that had occupied the two now vacant units did not renew his tenancy and moved out towards the end of 2023, Mr Heng said. Recently, many people came to view the property, so I am not surprised that it was put up for sale. I believe whoever is buying the property will continue to honour the tenancy agreement, he added.Mr Heng was already operating from the unit before Jiasheng Amoy bought it in 2021. Market observers noted that FTIs listings of the 10 shophouses did not indicate a guiding price. They estimated them to be valued at more than $100 million combined.Mr Richard Tan, founder ofPropNex Shophouse Elites, which specialises in that market segment, said: Based on the current market rate, all 10 units could be worth around $120 million.Some property agents told ST they have been wondering how the shophouses could be put up for sale amid the money laundering probe.I tried to ask FTI Consulting, but they said that they do not engage with agents. So I told my clients to submit their offers themselves, said Mr Tan.At least 10 foreigners have been arrested in Singapores largest anti-money laundering operations, with assets seized worth more than $3 billion.The assets confiscated include 207 properties, 77 vehicles, money in bank accounts amounting to more than $1.45 billion, and cash in various currencies that are worth more than $76 million.The propertiesare owned by individuals under investigation. Some of the properties are owned by the spouses or companies linked to the suspects.It was previously reported that major banks including DBS were creditors to investment companies linked to the individuals arrested. In 2021, the authorities detected signs of potential financial misconduct, including the use of suspected forged documents to validate fund sources in local bank accounts. Financial institutions and other companies filed suspicious transaction reports, prompting police investigations.By early 2022, a comprehensive intelligence probe revealed an interconnected network of individuals believed to be involved in the alleged activities, with some linked by familial ties.DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta disclosed that the bank had about $100 million in exposures to the money laundering case, involving mostly property purchases or retail customer accounts used to finance properties. Checks by ST found that DBS registered two charges on Suyh as early as July 2022, and four charges on Jiasheng Amoy in February 2023, before news of themoneylaunderingcase broke in August 2023.A charge is a form of security interest usually taken by a lender or creditor to secure repayment of a loan.October 2021: Former Citibank employee Wang Qiming is investigated by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) for forgery-related offences. Money laundering investigations start after the authorities become aware of the use of suspected forged documents to substantiate sources of funds in bank accounts in Singapore.Early 2022: Police launch an extensive intelligence probe that uncovers a web of people believed to be connected to one another, with some associated by familial ties.July 2022: DBS Bank registers two charges on Suyh, owned by Chinese national Su Fuxiang.February 2023: DBS registers four charges on Jiasheng Amoy, owned by Su Binghai.Aug 15, 2023: Police conduct a massive islandwide blitz led by the CAD that involves more than 400 officers. Nine men and one woman are arrested and charged the next day with various offences, including money laundering, forgery and resisting arrest.September 2023: DBS appoints FTI Consulting as the receiver for Jiasheng Amoy and Suyh and takes possession of the assets of the two companies in an attempt to recover mortgage loans.

The manager attributed the rise in distributable income to proactive portfolio management and prudent cost management.The real estate investment trust (Reit) will pay the distribution on March 28, after the record date on Feb 15.Ms Teo Swee Lian, chairman of CICTs manager, said the Reit adopted a conservative approach in 2023 in response to challenging market conditions and a high-cost environment.We focused on driving organic growth through proactive portfolio management, prudent cost management and discipline in capital management. This strategy has yielded positive results.For the full year ended Dec 31, DPU was 1.6 per cent higher at 10.75 cents as distributable income climbed 1.9 per cent to $715.7 million. Gross revenue was 8.2 per cent higher at $1.6 billion, while NPI rose 7 per cent to $1.1 billion for the full year.The improvement in performance was mainly due to higher contributions from Raffles City Singapore, coupled with full-year contributions from the Reits 2022 acquisitions, the manager said.The gains were offset by higher finance costs from the full-year impact of borrowings taken to fund the acquisitions in 2022 and higher interest rates.CICT signed 1.7 million sq ft of new leases and renewals during the full-year period, comprising one million sq ft in office space and 700,000 sq ft in retail space.Its committed portfolio occupancy was 97.3 per cent for the 12 months ended December, up 1.5 percentage points from the same period the previous year.The Reits aggregate leverage stood at 39.9 per cent as at Dec 31, 2023. Some 78 per cent of its total borrowings were on fixed interest rates.CICTs debt maturity is well spread over various tenures, with an average term to maturity of 3.9 years.CICT units closed two cents higher at $1.98 on Feb 6.

But it also reflects shifting dynamics on the LME as traders and warehouses respond to weaker markets. The past year has seen a return of metal financing plays as a major driver with Citi emerging as a key participant and so-called rent sharing deals being offered by warehouses are incentivising deliveries in places like Singapore that have not typically drawn huge volumes.A spokesperson for Citi declined to comment. The lead market has long been a backwater compared with larger industrial metals such as copper, but investor interest has grown since its inclusion in the Bloomberg Commodity Index in 2023. Its usage in conventional car batteries has also made it a proxy bet on the speed of the global switch to electric vehicles, with large increases in both bearish and bullish positioning seen in recent months as prices have traded sideways.The big influx of material has meant that LME storage availability is now getting tight in Singapore, some of the people said.Singapore has traditionally been an unpopular storage point for buyers looking to obtain metal, due to high logistics costs and land rental prices. Now that the metal is there, those additional costs and the downbeat outlook for demand mean that it is unlikely to leave the port soon, some of the people said.Singapores emergence as the LMEs key storage hub for lead and zinc partly reflects the effect of incentives for metal deliveries that are being offered by certain warehousing companies.Rent-sharing deals made popular during a massive years-long glut in the aluminium market give traders who deliver surplus cargoes into storage a share of the rent that warehouses collect from future owners. The total volume of LME metals stored in the port has now reached the highest level since 2014, when it was home to massive amounts of aluminium.People familiar with the deals say they have sparked a tug-of-war over stocks in Singapore and other ports, with owners withdrawing metal that is subject to rent-share deals and moving it into cheaper warehouses sometimes just a few minutes down the road. Besides creating logistical logjams, a constant shuffling of stocks between warehouses risks sending a distorting signal about the strength of supply and demand.Even so, analysts reiterated that the latest surge in inventories reflects how comfortably supplied the lead and zinc markets have become.Spreads between nearby LME contracts and later-dated futures have also pointed to an emerging glut, with spot prices trading at a record discount after the delivery. Zinc spreads also hit a record intraday discount on March 26, following on from a steady rebound in inventories in Singapore. Ultimately, it shows that theres a reasonable chunk of metal thats not needed, said Mr Dan Smith, head of research at Amalgamated Metal Trading. Traders natural inclination is to keep hold of stock because they want to have metal to sell to people when things get tight, so its normally a pretty negative sign when theyre looking to offload stock. Lead prices traded down 0.7 per cent lower on the LME on March 26, while zinc dropped 2.1 per cent. BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The Q4 spurt lifted the price index from a 0.8 per cent increase in Q3, to end the year with a 6.7 per cent gain, easing from the 8.6 per cent increase in 2022 and 10.6 per cent rise in 2021.Tan Tee Khoon, PropertyGuru country manager for Singapore, pointed out that price fluctuations across 2023 suggest that private home prices have more or less peaked.Still, this is the seventh straight year of growth for private home prices, after bottoming in mid-2017, said Tricia Song, head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia, CBRE. Prices are also up 32.3 per cent since the last trough in Q1 2020, she said.Much of 2023s price rise was fuelled by the suburban non-landed market, where prices rose 13.8 per cent during the year, said Song. Outside Central Region (OCR) price gains far outpaced prices in the city fringe areas of the Rest of Central Region (RCR), which rose by 2.7 per cent, and prime Core Central Region (CCR) prices which were 2.1 per cent higher year on year. Quarter on quarter (qoq), private condo prices in the OCR were up 4.6 per cent, following a 5.5 per cent increase in Q3.CCR prices rose slightly less, at 4.2 per cent in the fourth quarter but recovering from the previous quarters decline of 2.7 per cent. Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Two launches in particular chalked up unexpectedly strong sales when they were brought to market in the fourth quarter at benchmark prices. CapitaLands JDen in Jurong East sold 323 units at launch at an average price of S$2,451 per square foot (psf), while UOL and SingLands Watten House in Bukit Timah moved 102 units at an average price of S$3,230 psf.The two projects drove around half of new sales in their respective OCR and CCR segments in Q4, said Cushman & Wakefields research head Wong Xian Yang.In the RCR, prices fell 1.2 per cent in Q4, after a 2.1 per cent increase in the previous quarter. Some existing projects may have cleared their last unsold units at a discount, contributing to the decline in the RCR index, said Song. These include Liv @ MB in Mountbatten, Myra in Potong Pasir, and One Pearl Bank condo in Outram, which are now fully sold.Lower sales volume in Q4 and for the year, as well as the slower price gains outside the OCR, showed increasing buyer resistance to already high prices, analysts said. Cushman & Wakefields Wong noted that current non-landed price levels are at their historical peaks as at Q4 2023. Compared with pre-pandemic levels (at Q4 2019), CCR, RCR and OCR non-landed prices are cumulatively up by 11 per cent, 37 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, he said.Although household balance sheets are healthy, homebuyers have been and will continue to be circumspect in their housing decisions, said Knight Frank head of research Leonard Tay. However, Lee Sze Teck, Huttons senior director of data analytics, noted that the robust sales at the Q4 launches showed evidence of the ample liquidity of local buyers, as foreign buyers sat out following the hike in the Additional Buyers Stamp Duty (ABSD) last April.In Q4, Singaporeans and permanent residents accounted for 98.5 per cent of private home buyers, while foreigners accounted for 1.5 per cent.Based on caveats data as at Jan 2, 2024, purchases made by foreigners dropped to 62 in Q4 2023, compared with 271 in Q1 2023. It is also the lowest since the government first introduced ABSD in December 2011, said Lee.Transaction volume shrank during the year. Based on flash estimates released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Tuesday (Jan 2), the total sale transaction volume of private homes up to mid-December was 27 per cent lower than in Q3, falling to 3,800 units in Q4.This brought the full-year figure to 18,510 units, down 15 per cent from the 21,890 units sold in 2022. It is also the lowest annual sale transaction volume since 2016, said URA. The figure comprises new sales, resales and subsales, and excludes executive condo units.Landed properties had a strong showing in the last quarter of the year. Landed home prices rose 4.5 per cent in Q4, reversing a 3.6 per cent decline in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2023, landed home prices were up 7.8 per cent, from 9.6 per cent in 2022.Demand for freehold landed homes remains evergreen, said Knight Franks Tay, and the main obstacle to deals being successfully concluded will be the limited inventory of saleable stock.The 4.5 per cent price rise could be due to a slight increase in the number of detached house transactions, which stood at 43 units in Q4, from 39 in the previous quarter, said Ismail Gafoor, chief executive officer at PropNex Realty. The average price of a detached house also rose by around 16 per cent qoq to S$1,714 psf on land area. This may have mitigated weaker prices in the semi-detached and terrace house segments, he said.Landed homeowners are also inclined to set higher prices and show little urgency to sell, said ERAs chief executive officer Marcus Chu. More landed deals have fallen through as buyers and sellers hit an impasse on prices, he said.Market analysts are looking at prices slowing further, to land in the range of 3 to 5 per cent in the coming year. CBREs Song noted that the current high prices would continue to deter demand. With higher supply coming through, prices should slow down further in 2024, she said. But home prices are unlikely to correct significantly due to resilient household balance sheets and low unsold inventory. New-launch pricing is expected to remain elevated, due to already committed land and construction costs, said Tay.PropNexs Gafoor sees developers pricing units more sensitively in a bid to drive sales momentum at the launch weekend.As Tay noted, investors eyeing capital preservation, appreciation, and recurring income both locals and foreigners are likely to stay sidelined until interest rates peak, stabilise and perhaps reduce, and until there is more clarity in the economic outlook.Nonetheless, history has shown that experienced investors familiar with Singapores private residential scene are quick to react when windows of subdued activity turn with the return of transactional activity, he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

These include multi-million-dollar properties, ranging from luxury condominium units and landed homes to shophouses and Good Class Bungalows as well as commercial and industrial buildings. Some of these projects are worth more than $24 million each.The Nanyang Technological University environmental engineering graduate joined home-grown real estate company ERA fresh out of university. As a child, she would follow her father, who owns a construction company, to property viewings. Those early experiences sparked in her an enduring passion for real estate.I have always liked viewing houses and wanted a job that allows me to show others what I'm passionate about, she says. I didn't take the conventional route like many of my peers by climbing the corporate ladder but took a leap of faith into this industry despite having an engineering degree. To me, as long as you do your best in whatever field you are in, you can excel and be better than others.Such mindset and determination has set her on a successful journey in the real estate industry.Today, Ms Tng manages a team of 100 realtors. From 2020 to 2023, she has earned herself ERAs League of Honour title, the highest accolade in the company for attaining ERAs Top 10 Achievers out of more than 9,000 property agents for four consecutive years a remarkable feat that not many agents can achieve. For five consecutive years, she has received the ERA Millionaire Realtor award, earning $1 million in commission annually. In addition, she has also received the national SEAA diamond award for three consecutive years, earning herself a name in the industry.The self-made millionaire attributes her success to sheer hard work and determination, as well as holding the right life values. She believes in having good core values of honesty and integrity, being truthful towards her clients and sharing her most honest opinions in whatever she is selling. She prides herself on being knowledgeable, efficient and empathetic, always providing a listening ear to her customers to fully understand their requirements, something that makes her popular with clients.She says: It is about being fast, efficient, honest and genuine towards them. This is the reason why she garners countless five-star reviews from her clients. If she feels that a unit is not worth buying, she will share her thoughts with clients even if she loses the sale. I always tell clients the good and the bad so they can make a sound decision. Whats most important to me is building a long term relationship with my customers and being a family agent to them. she says. This attitude has given her many repeated customers over her 13-year career in this industry, many of them recommending her to family members.Real estate is not a 9-to-5 job, it is almost like running your own business and you will need discipline, adaptability, good mindset, learning attitude and strong core values to excel.On how studying engineering has helped her career, she explains: Real estate is not a 9-to-5 job, it is almost like running your own business and you will need discipline, adaptability, good mindset, learning attitude and strong core values to excel. Engineering is very systematic and it has helped me to be more structured when I plan my marketing framework for my customers.During her career, Ms Tng has encountered and sold a number of challenging properties including odd-shaped penthouses and shophouses. Some of these projects were unsold for years and marketed by numerous agents but were sold within three months after she was appointed as the sole agent.She says it is not about getting multiple agents, but rather getting one right agent who can successfully get your unit sold using the right marketing platforms as well as effective follow ups and negotiations skills to get clients the best price. Having an efficient and seasoned negotiator for your property will give you the results you desire, she explains.I believe all houses could be sold and its my duty to highlight why the house is suitable for a particular person, be it an investor or someone buying a home for their own stay. It all boils down to finding the right buyer who comprehends the potential of the property.To sell projects successfully, Ms Tng engages both conventional and digital marketing methods including social media platforms to give all properties maximum and targeted exposure. When physical viewings ceased during the Covid-19 pandemic, she focused on levelling up her digital marketing skills through training courses. She adds that by being adaptable and updated with new marketing methods allows her to better navigate fierce industry competition and meet client needs.This pivot proved fruitful Ms Tng sold many of her clients properties through the new methods she learnt.She thinks that realtors today have to be knowledgeable and up-to-date with current market trends as clients these days are more hands-on to do their own research even before engaging an agent. As a result, she describes her role as a partnership with clients, taking time to understand their requirements and deliver the outcomes they seek.This is why she attends courses regularly to keep herself updated of the latest technology and marketing methods. She also appreciates how ERA has apps that allow agents to retrieve information in seconds and being able to analyse market conditions and buyer preferences by district and conduct in-depth evaluations of her clients purchasing needs.Ms Tng strongly believes that real estate is an asset for wealth creation because of its capital appreciation in land-scarce Singapore.In 2019 she bought her first property, a condominium unit in Shenton Way. After selling it last year and earning a profit from the sales, she purchased a landed property. This was a goal she has been working towards over the last 13 years. The animal lover wanted a home big enough for her parents and four dogs so that all of them can stay together comfortably.Achieving this goal is very meaningful for me as I have always believed in working hard for my goals and being filial to my parents.\"To her, being a real estate agent is not about making money. It is about building a long-term career. Having a good reputation and holding the right values will ensure a long term sustainable career in this industry.More information here on how Ms Gina Tng can help you buy or sell your home.CEA Registration No. R027519D/ L3002382K"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

He also holds the status of being a millionaire realtor, a title awarded to agents who earn more than $1m in sales commission in a year.He heads a team of 150 realtors, plans and executes projects for higher management, recruits new talent for ERA, attends property viewings and closes transactions.Mr Lee quips that he is known for moving challenging private properties, like the time he was engaged to sell a one-bedroom penthouse unit in the East Coast enclave. Despite having eight agents market it over eight months, the property did not sell.He explains that while many homeowners desired a penthouse with a private rooftop terrace, this particular unit had a terrace outside the living quarters. To access it, one had to step out of the home and unlock three separate doors in an open, unsheltered area.I did home staging (styling a unit with props to make it look appealing) and a lot of premium marketing strategies. Then I pitched the penthouse to prospective buyers who were looking for a unique home with a unique lifestyle. And I sold it.For Mr Lee, being in sales is not just a job, it is a passion, a calling and a life-long career. As a young man, he fell in love with selling things for a living when he worked in the shoe section of a department store where he became the top salesperson.That was the first time I tasted the sweetness of doing sales. While my peers were waiting on tables or delivering heavy furniture at that age, I worked in an air-conditioned store yet I earned much more.He is not coy about admitting that there are plenty of opportunities to earn good money in a sales job.But I can also positively influence a customer. When I buy something, I also hope to meet a good salesperson with good advice. So I want to be that person whos there to help someone who wants to spend money.On a deeper level, Mr Lee shares: I also changed my life doing sales.Growing up, chicken rice was a luxury for him and his three younger siblings. Their taxi driver father and homemaker mother had enough money only to buy a McDonalds meal for the kids, not themselves. As his parents could not afford toys, Mr Lee made robot figurines out of clothes pegs.But his childhood experiences did not make him bitter. Instead, he credits his father for instilling a hardworking and can-do attitude in him.Even though we had so little, my parents have been encouraging all my life. As the eldest kid, I always wanted to do well so I can give them a comfortable life and they no longer have to be worried about money.He empathises a lot with those who feel lost about their career track or who do not have the family means to help them in their studies and jobs.After national service, my friends either went to university which my parents couldnt afford or they warmed the seat in their family businesses.Mr Lee, who has a diploma in mechatronic engineering from Temasek Polytechnic, told himself that he wanted a job that would become a life-long career. And this is what I found in the property industry at ERA.If you think that all realtors have to be sociable and fast-talking, Mr Lee is happy to dispel that myth. He has team members who are shy and introverted, or who cant speak glibly. But even they made at least $60,000 or up to a few hundred thousands in a year. They were single parents and had to earn a living. They knew they had to do well so they grinded through it all and learnt from mentors and leaders at ERA. As long as you can learn, you can make it.As a team leader, Mr Lee does one-to-one coaching and takes some of his agents out with him for property viewings for on-the-job training. He also attends training courses related to sales, leadership and self-development every year to elevate both my mind and heart skills. The savvy tech user keeps up to date on social media trends since influencer-style videos in property ads are now almost a prerequisite to hook in eyeballs.I enjoy helping other agents, empowering them and influencing their lives. When I can motivate them, I feel a lot of joy and it makes me happy. If you know the way to success, help someone get there too. If your life is all about yourself, you are living too small.This is why he now wants to recruit more agents in their twenties. I want to build the generation of real estate agents and see young people succeed like I did.There are lots of perks to starting young in the real estate industry. Younger agentscan earn ahead of their peers in other jobs and have a longer runway to build acustomer base as well as an entrepreneurial career that works like a self-ownedbusiness. For those who want to expand their social circles, there are manyopportunities to attend lifestyle events and company functions.Millennial and Gen Z generations also value the work-life balance and flexible hours real estate offers. You dont have to apply for leave and you decide what time you want to wake up and start work, says Mr Lee.This is how he is able to spend precious time on weekday evenings and weekends with his daughters, aged six and eight. His wife is also a realtor at ERA and the couple has won the Top Husband and Wife Award in the company.Ask him how far along he has come in life and he doesnt mention the usual status symbols like cars, watches and designer clothes. Instead he offers an unexpected anecdote.Before his father became a taxi driver, he delivered Christmas turkeys which the family could never afford.One day, his fathers boss let him bring home an unsold bird for dinner, and it left such an indelible mark on the young Mr Lee. Today, he never fails to order turkey as part of a lavish spread every Christmas for his parents and family.The turkey dish reminds me that my job has changed my life and my familys. And I hope I can now inspire others to take control of their future and transform their lives too."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

A net weighted balance of 10 per cent of manufacturing firms anticipate an improved business situation for the January to June period, according to a poll by the Economic Development Board (EDB). This is higher than the 7 per cent figure in its previous quarterly survey.EDB said the recovering global semiconductor industry is expected to lend a boost to demand, even amid continued geopolitical and economic challenges. Meanwhile, a Singapore Department of Statistics (SingStat) survey showed that for the services sector, a net weighted balance of 5 per cent of companies expect a more favourable business outlook, down from the 9 per cent in the previous survey.The net weighted balance is the difference between the weighted shares of positive and negative responses, with a positive figure indicating more optimism than pessimism.Among manufacturers, the electronics cluster emerged as the most optimistic.EDB said: This positive sentiment is largely led by the semiconductor segment, which anticipates a gradual recovery in demand as inventory levels in the end markets normalise alongside robust demand for artificial intelligence-related chips.The transport engineering cluster had a net weighted balance of 14 per cent of companies predicting positive business conditions to continue, led by the marine and offshore engineering segment, which continues to see robust orders from the oil and gas and renewable energy industries.Companies in the aerospace segment also expect sustained demand for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul activities on the back of strong global and regional air travel demand, EDB said. In the precision engineering cluster, a net weighted balance of 8 per cent of companies were upbeat. Companies expect improved orders for semiconductor-related equipment and bonding wires. But when it comes to output, a net weighted balance of 6 per cent of manufacturers expect lower output in the first quarter of 2024, compared with the fourth quarter of 2023. All clusters except transport engineering and chemicals project a lower level of production, EDB said. In the electronics industry, semiconductor makers expect a seasonally weak first quarter, while companies in the computer peripherals and data storage segment project lower output amid continued weakness in consumer electronics demand.Companies in the biomedical manufacturing industry also expect output to contract. The pharmaceutical and medical technology segments project a sequential decline due to a different product mix and lower export orders.Conversely, in the transport engineering industry, the aerospace segment anticipates more aircraft engine repair jobs from commercial airlines, while the marine and offshore engineering segment foresees a higher level of activity in the shipyards. In addition, the specialities segment in the chemicals industry expects higher output due in part to increased capacity, while the other chemicals segment anticipates higher output of flavours and fragrances to meet regional demand. In general manufacturing, companies in the printing and miscellaneous industries segments are concerned about higher operating costs, with printing companies expecting fewer print jobs due to digitalisation and those in miscellaneous industries projecting lower output in batteries and paperboard containers and boxes.As for manpower, a majority of companies in the manufacturing sector expect employment levels in the first quarter of 2024 to remain similar to the fourth quarter of 2023, with the biomedical industry the most optimistic and the precision engineering the least. Most companies reported no limiting factors that would affect their obtaining of export orders in the first quarter of 2024. The top two issues that they thought could be challenges are price competition from overseas, and political or economic conditions abroad, such as geopolitical tensions or conflicts and inflationary pressures, EDB said. Over in the services sector, SingStat said hoteliers expect an increase in tourist arrivals for leisure and business purposes, and the expected growth in the number of meeting, conference and exhibition events and concerts contributed to the positive sentiment of firms within the industry.Retailers are also positive, with the anticipated increase in shopping activities during the Chinese New Year period, as well as the disbursement of a larger amount of Community Development Council vouchers in January.The finance and insurance industry expects a pick-up in business as payment service providers attributed their positive sentiment to the rise in e-commerce spending.However, the transportation and storage industry expects business conditions to be challenging for the next six months. Water transport companies highlight reduced market demand amid economic uncertainties, while food and beverage operators are less optimistic for the first six months of 2024, compared with the last six months of 2023, which coincided with the year-end holiday and the festive season.Overall, the majority of the industries in the services sector still foresee higher revenue for the first quarter of 2024. Correction note: In an earlier version of the story, we said the net weighted balance of 10 per cent of manufacturing firms anticipated an improved business situation for January to July. This is incorrect: It should be from January to June."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(File photo: iStock) This audio is generated by an AI tool. JOHOR BAHRU: Some Singaporeans are snapping up properties near the Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link in Johor Bahru in anticipation of easier access across the border once the project is completed.Analysts said home prices have increased in recent years, with properties around the Bukit Chagar RTS station the Malaysia terminus seeing the highest demand.The RTS is a big draw factor, said real estate agent Ryan Khoo, who deals with properties in Johor. It will make the travel between Singapore and Johor Bahru a lot shorter.The service will ease the notorious bottlenecks along the Causeway one of the worlds busiest border crossings by transporting up to 10,000 passengers each way every hour.The RTS will be a game changer, said Dr Timothy Wong, a senior lecturer at the National University Singapores (NUS) Department of Economics.It is part of the greater plan to integrate the economies of these two cities more closely. The RTS plays quite nicely into the Johor-Singapore special economic zone (SEZ) because it eases the movement of people across the border.The light rail transport is one of the main draws that persuaded one such Singaporean to buy properties across the Causeway.Freelance lecturer Daniel Ong recently purchased two units from a development project located near Bukit Chagar station, citing additional factors like amenities and lower prices.It is easily accessible by public transport, what more with the RTS coming up, he told CNA.My wife and I quite enjoy the food and doing some shopping over there. We also find that the cost of living is definitely much lower than in Singapore.The 66-year-old plans to rent out one of the units and use the other as a retirement or vacation home.Older properties in the same area have also seen renewed interest from buyers, despite competition from new condominiums, said observers.Industry players said increased demand has pushed prices of properties within walking distance of the terminus up by about 18 per cent in the last two years. A two-bedroom condominium now costs about S$240,000 (US$180,000).This increase is expected to continue as the RTS progressively gets completed, said Dr Lee Nai Jia, head of real estate intelligence and digital and software solutions at the PropertyGuru Group.When it's fully operational, I think we will see another increase of maybe about 5 to 6 per cent. Prices are then likely to stabilise from there.Integrated developments with offices and retail spaces are also expected to be built in the area in the future.Rental prices have gone up as well. Apartments near the border are now commanding almost twice the rental compared to the pandemic period, when the Movement Control Order (MCO) prevented travel and caused rates to fall.(Each) studio unit previously was asking about RM1,000 (S$290) to RM1,200 per month during the MCO. Now the monthly rental is ranging from RM2,000 to RM2,300, said Mr Keith Ooi, group managing director of real estate agency Knight Frank Malaysia.The potential of earning a rental income led Singapore buyer James Lim to purchase a two-bedder condominium at a freehold mega project last month.When the RTS opens in two years time, this property price will definitely go up. The rental price will also definitely be quite attractive as compared to other places, said the 55-year-old, who also owns properties in other Malaysian cities including Genting and Kuala Lumpur.Industry players said a majority of tenants are Malaysians working in Singapore who are willing to commute daily across the border in exchange for the lower rental prices. Other sizeable groups of renters are Singaporeans and Chinese nationals.Real estate agents said there has been a surge in demand for Johor properties from Singapore buyers since early 2023.Most home seekers are above 40 years old and are planning their retirement options, they said. Aside from the stronger Singapore dollar and the draw of reducing their cost of living expenses, they also cited the proximity to the country as a huge appeal.The good thing about retiring in JB is that you (are so close to) Singapore you're still connected to your Singapore friends and family. Plus the RTS will make the travel a lot shorter, said Mr Khoo.Others purchased Johor properties as holiday homes or for investment purposes.Some Singaporeans are opting for an alternative destination with a lower or more competitive pricing. I see JB as a complement to the Singapore housing market an alternative destination for buyers and investors, said Mr Ooi.He added that the overall outlook for Johors property market remains positive, with demand expected to continue on an uptrend.Dr Wong said that while the heightened demand spells good news for property developers, this could also cause living expenses to be pushed up in Johor Bahru.There is going to be greater segmenting of income within JB because the city centre is going to become a wealthier district. That will send people who have lower incomes to the periphery, he told CNAs Singapore Tonight.With the SEZ in the works, however, Dr Wong said the initiative would be beneficial for businesses in both cities.From a business perspective, there are synergies that Singaporeans and Malaysians can make that can take place in JB that would enrich both cities. For example, export-driven sectors such as manufacturing can gain from (the SEZ), he said, giving an example of Singapore companies setting up in Johor, where land, material and labour costs are lower, and where commuting will soon be easier.On the Singapore side of the border, real estate analysts said they foresee an uptick in demand for homes near Woodlands North as the RTS nears completion, and expect new residential units to be added to the neighbourhood in the future.The governments of the two nations celebrated a construction milestone in the RTS project on Thursday, with about 65 per cent of structural works completed on both sides.The RTS Link is expected to start passenger service by December 2026."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Total factory output declined by 2.5 per cent year on year in December, a reversal from Novembers revised zero growth, according to data released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) on Jan 26. The initial estimate for November issued in December was for a 1 per cent rise in output. Excluding the volatile biomedical industry, factory output grew by 0.5 per cent in December. For the whole of 2023, manufacturing output shrank by 4.3 per cent. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, it contracted by 3.6 per cent for the whole year. The key electronics industry, which accounts for 45 per cent of local manufacturing production, was the best performer in December with 6.3 per cent year-on-year growth. Within electronics, the semiconductors segment expanded 17.7 per cent, supported by improved demand in selected end markets such as smartphones. However, other electronics modules and components shrank by 7.8 per cent, computer peripherals and data storage decreased by 17 per cent, and infocommunications and consumer electronics contracted by 18.1 per cent. For December, the biomedical industry was the worst performer, with production plunging 23.9 per cent year on year. Within the cluster, the medical technology segment increased 8.6 per cent, with higher export demand for medical devices. But output of the pharmaceuticals segment tumbled 45 per cent with lower production of biological products and a different mix of active pharmaceutical ingredients. DBS Bank economist Chua Han Teng noted that while the worst of Singapores factory slump is already over, the manufacturing recovery is expected to be gradual and fragile in 2024. He added: The global economic environment remains uncertain, due to high interest rates in advanced economies, the bumpy economic recovery in China, as well as lingering geopolitical tensions that could still disrupt supply chains the diversion of cargo ships in the Red Sea since December is a reminder of unexpected events that could hinder the trade and manufacturing recovery. Meanwhile, output in the transport engineering cluster edged up 0.2 per cent in December, over the same month in 2022. The aerospace segment led the charge with an expansion of 4.9 per cent due to higher demand for aircraft parts and more maintenance, repair and overhaul jobs from commercial airlines on the back of strong air travel demand globally. However, the marine and offshore engineering and land segments declined 1.7 per cent and 10.8 per cent, respectively. In the precision engineering industry, output fell 7.4 per cent year on year, with the machine and systems segment shrinking 1.8 per cent largely due to lower output of measuring devices and mechanical engineering works. The precision modules and components segment contracted 24.7 per cent, due to lower output in plastic and metal precision components, optical instruments as well as dies, moulds, tools, jigs and fixtures. General manufacturing output fell 15.9 per cent over December 2022, weighed down by lower production of batteries and structural metal products. In the chemicals cluster, output rose by 2.8 per cent year on year. The specialities and petroleum segments grew 29.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively, with the former recording higher production of mineral oil additives. The other chemicals segment declined 5.4 per cent on account of lower output in fragrances, while the petrochemicals segment fell 5.5 per cent due to weak market demand. UOB economists Alvin Liew and Jester Koh noted that output momentum could remain weak in the first half of 2024, as external demand continues to be weighed down by tight financial conditions. These include an elevated interest rate environment in the United States and the European Union, as well as the ongoing stresses in the property sector in China, which could dampen consumer and business sentiment.The economists said:Signs of a broader recovery in manufacturing could emerge towards the middle of 2024 as central banks in major advanced economies may begin to lower policy rates as inflation in their respective economies moderate and inch closer to the 2 per cent objective, with the consequent easing of financial conditions supporting consumption and investment activity, which will imply a gradual recovery in external demand."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

He said: More land has been shifted to the reserve list for industrialists to trigger if there is a need. The manufacturing sector has not been doing well, with factory output and exports declining. Occupancy rates of single-user factory space have eased since (the second quarter of) 2020. As a result, demand for industrial land has reduced. The reduction in land supply will shift demand to the resale market and help the industrial property market to stabilise. The Government launched 13.75ha of industrial land across nine sites under the IGLS programme for the first half of 2024, with five sites on the confirmed list totalling 8.29ha and four sites amounting to 5.46ha on the reserve list. The five confirmed sites for the second half of 2024 are in Jalan Papan, Lok Yang Way, Tuas Bay Drive, Kaki Bukit and Tukang Innovation Drive, while the five parcels on the reserve list are in Jalan Papan, Tuas Road, Tukang Innovation Drive, Gambas Way and Tampines North Drive.Under the system, a site on the reserve list will be launched for tender if there is an offer of a minimum purchase price that is acceptable to the Government, or if more than one unrelated party submits minimum purchase prices that are close to the Governments reserve price for the site within a reasonable period.In an e-mail to The Business Times on June 28, JTC explained that the decline in land quantum in H2 was due to the inclusion of an exceptionally large multi-user factory site at Kallang Way under the confirmed list in H1. It added that there has not been a decrease in the total number of sites released across recent IGLS launches. THE BUSINESS TIMES"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

More deals of larger quantums were completed during the quarter, the data showed. Shophouse deals totalled 20 in the first quarter with 17 freehold units and three leasehold units sold. In the previous quarter, a total of 16 shophouses were sold, 25 per cent less than in the first quarter.Overall average unit price rose 27.1 per cent to $5,566 per sq ft (psf) on land, compared with the $4,380 psf on land in the fourth quarter of 2023.In 2023, shophouse sales came to 132 units worth $1.2 billion. The number of units was 31 per cent lower than the 191 units transacted in 2022 worth $1.6 billion. Shophouse sales have fallen from their peak in 2021, when a total of 254 units worth $1.94 billion changed hands. Huttons Asias senior director of data analytics, Mr Lee Sze Teck, said in a separate report on shophouses: The revival of interest in the shophouse market may be due to the Singapore Police Force initiating the process to sell shophouses linked to the money laundering probe. There was some uncertainty over how and when these shophouses will be disposed of. He said the clarity over the process and prices brought buyers back to the market, which led to slightly more transactions in the first quarter of 2024.The first-quarter sales reported by Knight Frank did not include sales of any shophouses that were seized in the money laundering probe that were eventually released for sale to repay creditors. Total transaction value for freehold shophouse units sold in the first quarter rose 44 per cent from the previous quarter at $149.9 million. Leasehold unit sales came to $19.2 million, up 175.9 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2023. For freehold shophouses, the average unit price increased 10.9 per cent over the quarter to $5,671 psf on land, from $5,115 psf on land. Leasehold shophouses showed a steeper surge, with the average unit price rising 243.9 per cent to $4,895 psf on land, from $1,423 psf on land in the fourth quarter of 2023. Since additional buyers stamp duty rates were raised in 2023 for foreign buyers and investors buying residential property, interest has filtered into non-residential assets, with agents reporting increased interest in commercial properties such as shophouses. The first quarter of 2024 saw six deals that were signed above $10 million, three of which were above $15 million, based on Knight Franks report. District 8, which consists of Little India, Farrer Park and Serangoon Road, stood out with the highest number of sales. Seven shophouses changed hands, amounting to a total transaction value of $51.6 million. The biggest deal in the first quarter was for the sale of a freehold shophouse in Pagoda Street in District 1 for $19 million, said Huttons.The seller made an estimated $2.75 million after holding it for around five years, said Mr Lee.Shophouse leasing volume, meanwhile, slipped during the quarter. The number of rental contracts for shophouses was 5.6 per cent lower quarter on quarter, and 7.2 per cent lower compared with the year-ago period. Median rents continued to hold firm, inching up by 1.9 per cent in the first quarter, said Huttons.Mr Lee expects confidence to gradually return to the shophouse market, with the uncertainty over the shophouses implicated in the money laundering probe removed.He said: The shophouse market is expected to see steady interest from investors in the coming quarters. The rarity of shophouses, the lower barrier to entry for foreign investors compared to the residential market and the potential for capital appreciation will support prices in the market.Knight Frank projects the sales volume of shophouses to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the rest of 2024.

The confirmed list sites, which include one executive condominium (EC) site and one commercial and residential site, can collectively yield about 5,050 private residential units including 560 EC units and 14,300 sq m GFA of commercial space. The confirmed list supply dipped 7.3 per cent or 400 units from 5,450 private residential units in the first half of 2024 the first drop following seven consecutive increases. We believe the pause in ramping up supply is wise, considering the lacklustre response in the recent land tenders and decade-low developer sales, Ms TriciaSong, CBREs head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia, said.Nonetheless, a total supply of 11,110 private homes, including 610 units from the triggered reserve list site at Zion Road (parcel B) for 2024, will be the highest supply introduced in a single year since 2013.Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of data analytics at Huttons Asia, noted that there are no new sites with long-stay serviced apartments added for the second half 2024 GLS, after a pilot site for 100 long-stay serviced apartments and 540 private home in Upper Thomson Road closed on June 19 with no bids.Interestingly, a River Valley Green (parcel B) site, which had a long-stay serviced apartment component, was moved to the confirmed list for the second half 2024 from the first half 2024 reserve list, with less stringent requirements, Ms Song noted. A portion of the GFA for this site will now be allowed for 220 serviced apartments, which have a seven-dayminimumstay, out of a total of 580 units, she pointed out. Previously, under the first half 2024 reserve list, it was stipulated that the site will have 360 conventional housing units and 200-220 long-stay serviced apartments, which have a three-month minimumstayperiod. Ms Song added that in view of poor participation in large sites with over 600 units, the sites offered in this round have a more palatable quantum, which should mitigate developers risks of not being able to sell out within five years and incurring hefty additional buyers stamp duty of 35 per cent.A number of new sites in the second half 2024 GLS slate many comprising between 300 units and less than 600 private homes each are being released in the suburbs, a relatively more affordable area for upgraders, Ms ChristineSun, chief researcher and strategist at OrangeTee Group, noted.MrWongXianYang,Cushman& Wakefields head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia, said that given the drop in land prices, developers with strong financial firepower and are able to navigate the higher interest rate environment are in a good position to pick up plum sites at attractive prices.The Government will also make available on the reserve list five private residential sites including two EC sites, one commercial site, two white sites which allow for a mix of uses and one hotel site. These sites can yield an additional 3,090 private residential units, including 730 EC units for developers to trigger for development if they assess there is demand; 99,350 sq m GFA of commercial space and 530 hotel rooms, said the Ministry of National Development.PropNex chief executive Ismail Gafoor said that six of the 10 confirmed list sites are near an MRT station increasingly a key priority among owner-occupiers and investors. The latest GLS slate presents a good selection, including 10 plots that are newly added. These include Faber Walk, Media Circle parcels A and B, Chuan Grove, Holland Link, and a mixed-use site at Chencharu Close, Ms Wong Siew Ying, PropNexs head of research and content, said.New on the reserve list are sites in Marina Gardens Lane, Woodlands Drive 17 (EC), Holland Plain, and River Valley Green (parcel C), she added.The Tampines Street 95 EC site should see good interest because ECs are popular due to their affordability compared with condominiums. Sites in Bayshore Road, Chuan Grove and Chencharu Close are also attractive, analysts say. Developers would be keen to get a first-mover advantage in the Bayshore precinct, especially since the last two GLS land tenders for what are currently The Bayshore and Costa Del Sol were more than two decades ago. On the Chencharu Close site, developers may be keen on this new growth area, but the price quantum could be around $1 billion, given a potential gross development area of over one million square feet, and the development of an integrated community and bus interchange, Knight Frank Singapores research head Leonard Tay said. Ahead of the results for a 6.5ha white site in the Jurong Lake District that closed in March 2024, there continues to be no new commercial or hotel sites on the confirmed list for 2H 2024 to mitigate oversupply risks, Ms Song said. The white site for a mixed-use development at Woodlands Avenue 2, a short-term lease commercial site at Punggol Walk, and a hotel site at River Valley Road will be carried over to the second half 2024 reserve list.The Marina Gardens Crescent white site, which had been on the first half 2023 GLS confirmed list, was placed in the reserve list after a sole bid of $770.5 million or $984 psf per plot ratio was deemed too low, and the tender was not awarded, analysts said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The European Union just passed its Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which forms part of a growing array of net-zero regulations.Banks in the EU are already reacting by setting stricter conditions around commercial real estate financing. BNP Paribas, the EUs largest bank, now targets cuts that may be as deep as 41 per cent of the emissions intensity of its portfolio through 2030. Others, including Banco Santander, Barclays, ING Groep and NatWest Group, have either already taken or are exploring similar measures.Mr Vincent Bryant, chief executive of Deepki, said he regularly sees banks raising the cost of borrowing for commercial real estate clients that do not live up to green energy standards. To manage such risks, banks are increasingly relying on tools such as the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor, or CRREM, to screen clients.Banks are telling clients that if they do not follow CRREM, interest rates will be as much as 15 basis points higher per year, Mr Bryant said. Conversely, those that perform well stand to see their borrowing costs go down, he added.The development is playing out as the commercial market struggles to right itself after years of turbulence due to higher interest rates and volatile post-pandemic occupancy rates.Mr Bryant says the Deepki survey indicates that energy-related headaches are likely to grow for property owners. Half of the managers surveyed said a further 20 per cent to 40 per cent of their real estate portfolios are at risk of becoming stranded assets in the next three years.Data gathered by Deepki, which operates in 65 countries and whose clients span pension funds to insurers, asset managers and banks, indicate that managers whose properties are not meeting new green standards increasingly risk having to sell at a loss.We see daily examples of clients that face additional discounts when they sell an asset, Mr Bryant said. And that is due to the fact that the building is stranded, and it comes on top of other issues such as the vacancy or the modernity or the location of the buildings. BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Average vacancy rates at logistics properties in east and north China are approaching 20 per cent, the highest in years, according to real estate consultancies.More warehouses are being built, which is making the problem worse. We are looking at a supply glut in logistics and industrial properties in China, said Mr Xavier Lee, an equity analyst at Morningstar who covers the property sector. The deterioration has been disappointing for property owners that were counting on an economic rebound in China in 2024.Global institutions have collectively invested over US$100 billion (S$135 billion) in warehouses, industrial buildings, office towers and other Chinese commercial real estate over the past decade, data from MSCI Real Capital Analytics shows. The foreign investors include Singapores GIC, CapitaLand Group, Blackstone, Prudential Financials PGIM, and many others.A few institutions are contemplating divestments of their worst-performing assets before rents fall further. Others intend to wait out the downturn and expect to make money in the long run.The best locations are still resilient, said Mr Hank Hsu, CEO and co-founder of Forest Logistics Properties which owns warehouses and distribution centres at major transportation hubs such as Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan.Six-year-old Forest Logistics has about US$2.5 billion in assets under management from investors that include private equity firms, insurance companies and pension funds. It counts Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, courier SF Express, and multinational consumer products makers among its customers. Mr Hsu said the recent market weakness has not deterred his firms expansion plans, with another logistics facility in the southern Greater Bay area to be built in the coming months. We will keep deploying capital in China in the next one to two years because we consider it a golden opportunity. Chinas commercial real estate sector was a bright spot through much of the housing downturn that began in 2021. It is now feeling the effects of spending cutbacks by consumers and businesses. The softening in the logistics and industrial sectors is happening alongside an office property slump that is playing out in major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. Both slumps are partly the result of overbuilding that was powered by the large sums of money that poured into commercial real estate when interest rates, borrowing and construction costs were low. Warehouses that were built to house e-commerce fulfilment centres, giant refrigerators for chilled or frozen produce, and spaces for businesses to hold their components and manufactured goods are not being utilised as much as their owners hoped.Chinas domestic e-commerce growth has been sluggish, as shoppers have become thriftier. The countrys online penetration rate for retail sales is already relatively high at 30 per cent.Heightened geopolitical tensions are prompting companies to shift some of their manufacturing offshore, to cater to end-customers that want to reduce their reliance on China. That and a slowdown in cross-border trade have also reduced businesses need for storage facilities in mainland China.The warehouse vacancy rate in east China where many logistics properties are clustered climbed to 19.2 per cent in the first quarter, according to data from Cushman & Wakefield. The overall vacancy rate nationwide was 16.5 per cent, thanks in part to the better performing southern region.The situation in China contrasts with the Ubited States and other logistics markets in Asia. In the US, vacancies have increased at industrial properties and warehouses in some parts of the country, but they are at mid-single-digit percentage rates that are below historical averages, and rents are still rising. In Asia, logistics assets in South Korea, Japan and Australia are enjoying high occupancies and rent growth. Of the 20 major Chinese cities that Cushman tracks, 13 saw logistics rents drop in the first quarter from the preceding three months, led by Beijing and Shenzhen, with falls of 4.2 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively. An additional 33 million sq m equivalent to around 4,600 soccer pitches of new supply is due for completion by end-2026 in the country, the consultancy said. CapitaLand China Trust, which owns malls, business parks and other properties, acquired four logistics parks in Shanghai, Wuhan and other cities in late 2021 for a total of 1.68 billion yuan (S$313 million). The logistics portfolios overall occupancy rate dropped to 82 per cent at the end of 2023 from 96.4 per cent a year earlier.The Singapore-listed Reits shares have lost 27 per cent in the year to date, versus a 2.7 per cent gain for the benchmark Straits Times Index. We are actively engaging prospects for our logistics parks to further improve occupancy, said a spokesperson for CapitaLand China Trust. Industrial parks in China that were designed as science and technology clusters with office buildings and manufacturing facilities are also losing multinational and local companies. The overall vacancy rate at business parks in Beijing was 20.5 per cent in the first quarter, according to Colliers data.In Guangzhou, the countrys southern manufacturing base, some multinational companies are shutting plants and changing their business strategies after a disappointing post-pandemic recovery.Lonza Group, a Swiss healthcare manufacturing company, said earlier in 2024 that it will close a drug manufacturing facility following a strategic review.The 17,000 sq m factory started production just three years ago in the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City, a high-tech business park jointly backed by the citys local government and CapitaLand.Firms now have the upper hand when negotiating lease renewals for warehouses and other properties. Competition for tenants is pretty intense at the moment, said Mr Luke Li, managing director at ESR Group, during an online conference about the logistics sector in mid-June.The Hong Kong-based real estate asset manager owns e-commerce distribution centres, cold chain storage facilities and manufacturing industrial parks in China and other countries. To keep warehouses occupied, landlords have been offering flexible rent terms, better amenities and other sweeteners to tenants, Mr Li added.ESRs revenue from the Greater China region fell by 20 per cent in 2023 from the year before, its most recent financial report shows. The firm cited weaker consumer sentiment and lower leasing demand as reasons for the fall. Mapletree Logistics Trust, another Singapore-listed Reit, has also been having a hard time in China. Rents across its 43 properties there fell 10 per cent in the first three months of 2024, and some tenants have fallen behind on their rent payments. The trust has maintained the occupancy of its China logistics assets at around 93 per cent. Ms Ng Kiat, the Mapletree Reits chief executive, said on an April earnings call that the China environment will remain volatile and uncertain for the next 12 months. The trust is focusing on tenant retention and looking to sell some of its poorest performing China assets, she added. We are trying to get greater clarity on whether we are seeing the bottom. But I dont think we are seeing it now. Well have to wait for a while, Ms Ng said. Rents at logistics properties are not going up even though the buildings are occupied, said Mr Humbert Pang, head ofChinaat Gaw Capital Partners, an alternative-investment firm that owns real estate assets. I think most of the logistics space owners are having a tough time negotiating with the existing or new tenants, he added. BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The 11-storey complex comprises 150 strata-titled units 127 shops and 23 apartments of which 126 are owned by CDL.Situated at 402 Orchard Road, it sits on a 20,264 sq ft freehold site zoned for commercial use, with height control of up to 20 storeys. At the $438 million guide price, the property is being marketed at about $3,397 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr), assuming full commercial use, said marketing agent Savills Singapore on April 18.This would include a land betterment charge of $7.6 million, and is based on redevelopment of up to 131,186 sq ft the sites approved development baseline.The most recent commercial deal done en bloc in the Orchard area was for freehold commercial complex Ming Arcade, which was sold for $172 million in December 2022. The sale price worked out to $3,125 psf ppr, marking a record-high land rate in the market. Earlier in 2022, freehold Tanglin Shopping Centre was sold for $868 million, or $2,769 psf ppr, to the Tanoto familys Pacific Eagle Real Estate.Just off Orchard Road, the Scotts Square mall was put on the market in January but has not yet closed a sale at its $450 million asking price, which pitches the retail podium at $3,438 psf ppr.In September 2023, a deal was struck to sell Far East Shopping Centre to Chinese billionaire Du Shuanghua for about $910 million, or $3,421 psf ppr. However, the deal unravelled when the buyers redevelopment proposal, submitted under the Governments Strategic Development Incentive (SDI) scheme, was rejected by the authorities. The Delfi Orchard collective sale would mark CDLs third major divestment in two years, after it sold its strata holdings in Tanglin Shopping Centre and Golden Mile Complex in 2022.The group booked a pre-tax gain of $256.3 million after completing the collective sale of Tanglin Shopping Centre, and $75.6 million after Golden Mile Complexs collective sale, in its 2022 financial year. CDLs past annual report indicated that it bought 118 units at Delfi Orchard in 1991. The properties were reported to have been acquired for $95 million from Japanese developer Yamasin.The group went on to buy Palais Renaissance next door from the same developer in 1993, for $115 million. It completed a $7 million asset enhancement of the building in 2022.CDLs portfolio includes Orchard Hotel and Claymore Connect in the area, a stake in the St Regis Singapore hotel nearby, and stakes in The Singapore Edition hotel and Boulevard 88 condo along Cuscaden Road.At Delfi Orchard, owners of the 23 apartments stand to pocket between $2.2 million and $4.6 million each, Savills said in response to The Business Times queries. Commercial unit owners stand to get between approximately $984,000 and $24 million for each unit. The bulk of the proceeds would go to CDL, as the group owns the majority of titles in the building. Delfi Orchard has been built up to its approved development baseline of 131,186 sq ft, or a plot ratio of 6.474, based on the sites approved Master Plan ratio of 4.9. Mr Jeremy Lake, Savills Singapores managing director of investment sales and capital markets, said: The successful collective sales of Tanglin Shopping Centre and Ming Arcade, brokered by Savills, are a testament to the strong attributes of the Orchard Road locale... Delfi Orchard is another rare opportunity for developers looking to acquire a prime redevelopment site at the gateway of Orchard Road.He added: With exciting plans to link the arts, entertainment and shopping experience of Orchard Road as a lush urban corridor, Delfi Orchard is strategically placed to benefit from a major redevelopment. The buyer may also consider applying for the SDI scheme, which allows buyers to extend the gross floor area of a redeveloped building on condition that they engage in a joint integrated redevelopment with adjacent sites.The public tender for Delfi Orchard closes at 3pm on May 27.

Declines in real estate investment and home prices both gathered pace in May.Industrial production rose 5.6 per cent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said, slowing from April and missing the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Retail sales offered some encouragement, picking up more than expected, but Chinese shoppers remain far from recovering their pre-pandemic mojo. The numbers add up to a still-weak recovery, most economists said likely requiring more action from Beijing to bolster consumer demand and tackle imbalances, if 2024s 5 per cent growth target is to be met. That could take the form of stepped-up government spending and heightened efforts by the central bank to put a floor under housing markets and get credit flowing.The most disappointing thing in Mays data is probably that property sales barely saw any improvements even after so many supportive measures, said BNP Paribas chief China economist Jacqueline Rong. She said Chinas authorities need to find ways to lower the rates on existing mortgages, closing the gap with the cost of new ones.The Peoples Bank of China on June 17 kept a key interest rate unchanged for the tenth straight month. Economists say the banks room to cut rates is constrained by the need to prop up the renminbi, which faces downward pressure as the US Federal Reserve reinforces its high-for-longer message.Bloomberg economists Chang Shu and David Qu said: Policy support could make a significant difference. But the Peoples Bank of Chinas focus on currency stability appears to have tied its hands on cutting interest rates at least until the Federal Reserve moves. This means the main support will have to come from the recent policies to aid the property market and government spending on big investment.Chinese stocks declined, with the onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index closing 0.2 per cent lower. A gauge of Chinese developers shares fell 3.2 per cent as at 3.08 pm local time.Overall fixed-asset investment rose 4 per cent in the January to May period, down from 4.2 per cent in the first four months even though there has been a pickup in government bond issuance to fund infrastructure spending.Chinas growth remains highly uneven, with exports and new energy-related capex as the drivers while consumption and property as the drags, according to economists including Dr Larry Hu at Macquarie Capital. Still, the slowdown is not severe enough to threaten the growth target, and while policymakers may take some limited action, the urgency for a major stimulus is low, they wrote.The acceleration in retail sales was the first since November. At 3.7 per cent, the pace remains less than half the 8 per cent or so that was typical before the pandemic, even though social and economic life has largely returned to normal.And even those gains may not last, according to Societe Generale economist for greater China Michelle Lam.It remains to be seen if the better momentum in retail sales is sustainable, she said. Since households have been reluctant to spend, China has turned to export-led growth instead. A factory boom helped offset the housing slump and kept economic growth on track. But that strategy faces growing uncertainties as major partners erect new trade barriers that threaten the export engine. Last week, the European Union followed the US by imposing hefty tariffs on Chinese electric cars.Seeking to shore up demand at home, China rolled out a programme in April that offers incentives for businesses and households to upgrade old machinery.Part of the plan involves government subsidies for buyers of new cars. The data on June 17 suggests the impact has been limited. Retail sales of automobiles fell 4.4 per cent from a year earlier in May, only a slight improvement from the previous month.In late May, China also unveiled a broad rescue package to prop up housing sales as a credit crisis was engulfing some of the countrys biggest real estate developers. It relaxed mortgage rules and encouraged local governments to buy unsold homes. Many investors and analysts have cautioned that the financial incentives are not big enough and trial programmes in several cities have shown progress can be slow. Subdued demand at home and deteriorating foreign trade are weighing on business confidence, discouraging companies from investing and driving some to move production overseas. Credit growth has been lacklustre, and the M1 money supply gauge contracted in May at the fastest rate in data going back to 1996. In a survey of more than 400 top executives conducted by UBS Group over roughly a month through mid-May, companies reported weaker prospects for orders, revenue and margins compared with the same period in 2023. There was a drop in the share of respondents who plan to increase capital expenditure in the second half of 2024. We still need to see new stimulus coming in, said Dr Helen Qiao, chief Greater China economist at Bank of America Global Research, in a Bloomberg TV interview. Otherwise the growth momentum could very much weaken. BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "SINGAPORE - The economy grew in the first quarter of 2024 at its weakest pace in a year, dragged by slower expansion of the export-driven manufacturing sector, according to the final estimates released by Singapores Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on May 23.On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the economy expanded by 0.1 per cent in the January-March period, slower than the 1.2 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, MTI said. It was the weakest pace of growth since a 0.5 per cent contraction in the first quarter of 2023.The base effect, when compared with the same period in 2023, helped the economy post year-on-year growth of 2.7 per cent, higher than the 2.2 per cent expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, it still missed a median forecast of 3 per cent by economists in a Bloomberg News poll.MTI kept its full-year 2024 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast of 1 per cent to 3 per cent, saying that Singapores manufacturing and trade-related sectors are expected to see a gradual pickup in growth over the course of the year.Within the manufacturing sector, the electronics cluster is projected to recover gradually in the coming quarters, supported by demand for semiconductors for end-markets such as smartphones, PCs and AI (artificial intelligence), MTI said in a statement.However, the ministry warned that Singapore remains vulnerable to downside risks in the global economy. Escalations in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East or the war in Ukraine could disrupt global supply chains and commodity markets, it said.Additionally, if inflation remains stubborn in advanced economies, central banks there could further tighten financial conditions and potentially trigger latent vulnerabilities in banking and financial systems.Beyond these immediate risks, central banks in advanced economies are still expected to cut their benchmark interest rates later in 2024 as inflation eases, which should help support global growth.Looking ahead, GDP growth in the major economies is expected to taper gradually in the immediate quarters due to tight financial conditions, before picking up alongside anticipated policy rate cuts later in the year, Mr Gabriel Lim, MTIs permanent secretary, said in a virtual media briefing.MrEdward Robinson,deputy managing director and chief economistat the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said at the briefing that MAS current policy stance favouring trade-weighted appreciation of the Singapore dollar against currencies of its trading partners remains appropriate to keep inflation at bay.Meanwhile, a strong pickup in services could help mitigate some of the downward pressure from the global economy.Even as the manufacturing sector contracted by 1.8 per cent year on year and by 5.4 per cent quarter on quarter in the first three months of 2024, the services sector expanded by an annual 3.9 per cent and 1.9 per cent on the quarter.The stronger-than-anticipated recovery in air travel and tourism demand will continue to bolster the growth of aviation- and tourism-related sectors such as accommodation, air transport and aerospace, as well as consumer-facing sectors such as retail trade and food and beverage services, MTI said.At the same time, the finance and insurance sector will be supported by higher tourist spending, while the projected peaking of global interest rates will support the banking and fund management segments through higher commissions and fees, it added.While the electronics industry was among the weakest performers in the manufacturing sector, MTI remained hopeful of a potential turnaround. It said growth in the electronics cluster will in turn have positive spillover effects on the precision engineering cluster, as well as the machinery, equipment and supplies segment of the wholesale trade sector.The optimism is backed by forecasts by international bodies such as the World Trade Organisation, which expects global merchandise trade to grow by 2.6 per cent in 2024, after 2023s 1.2 per cent contraction.Separately on May 23, Enterprise Singapore said the increase in 2024 key exports was likely to come in at the lower end of its 4 per cent to 6 per cent growth forecast due to a disappointing start to the year. Key exports fell 3.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, following a 1.4 per cent decline in the previous quarter.DBS Bank economist Chua Han Teng said Singapores economic recovery in 2024 will hinge on the performance of external-oriented services clusters such as wholesale trade and transportation and storage. The clusters, in the first quarter, grew at a faster pace on both an annual and quarterly basis.Still, the importance of electronics to the Singapore economys underlying strength cannot be overstated. The cluster alone accounts for almost half of overall factory output and over 9 per cent of the countrys GDP.Mr Chua said that while the outlook for manufacturing in general and electronics in particular appears fragile, forward-looking indicators point to a recovery. The latest business expectations survey, for example, showed that manufacturers are positive on prospects for the six-month period of April-September 2024 across all clusters.We expect Singapores electronics output to benefit from positive spillovers arising from the ongoing global tech upturn, said Mr Chua. The increasing use of AI applications is likely to kick-start a replacement cycle for smartphones and PCs, he said.Ms Selena Ling, chief economist and head of global markets research and strategy at OCBC Bank, pointed to global AI hardware leader Nvidias latest quarterly results and guidance for the second quarter, which suggested that the global AI boom is far from over.She said recent trade data also pointed to a pickup in demand and prices for smartphones, data centre operators and AI developers for instance, semiconductor shipments for South Korea jumped an annual 45.5 per cent in the first 20 days of May.Both OCBC and DBS expect Singapores 2024 GDP growth to come in at around 2 per cent."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It creates a very lively environment,\" said Mr Tan in Mandarin.He owns three shop spaces in Jurong that he rents out.On Sunday (Jan 19), the Housing Board announced the completion of renewal plans for the Jurong Lake area under its Remaking Our Heartland (ROH) programme. It was selected in 2011 for rejuvenation along with East Coast and Hougang.Over the years, the housing estate has been progressively fitted with new amenities such as interconnected gardens and communal spaces.One of the key ideas under the programme was the rejuvenation of the Jurong East Town Centre, comprising Blocks 130 to 135 Jurong Gateway Road. Now renamed as J Connect, its building facade and communal spaces were overhauled and given a modern look with lush landscaping.It connects with the nearby JCube shopping mall via J Link.Under the ROH programme, 10 neighbourhood centres within the housing estate have also been transformed.For instance, Bukit Batok West Shopping Centre now has a community pavilion with rooftop greenery and a community garden with more than 20 types of herbs. It is home to 65 shops, numerous eateries, a wet market and a supermarket.The area around Jurong East MRT station, which is now known as Jurong Gateway, is also a bustling town, with an integrated healthcare hub consisting of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital, and mixed-use developments such as Westgate and Jem.A new 15km Jurong Lake District cycling network will be connected to the upcoming cycling paths in Taman Jurong estate, which are expected to be completed this year.Jurong began as an industrial town in the 1960s.In the 1970s, residents living in Hong Kah - present-day Tengah - and surrounding villages were resettled in estates such as Boon Lay, Taman Jurong, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Hong Kah, Teban Gardens and Yuhua.The completion of rejuvenation plans does not mean the end of new developments, said the HDB.From 2021, the remaining sections of Jurong Lake Gardens, including the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, will be completed. The western section was opened to the public in April 2019.By 2026, the Jurong Lake Area will become a leisure and recreational cluster, complete with a new 7ha integrated tourism development and the new Science Centre, developed around Jurong Lake.These will be part of the up-and-coming Jurong Lake District that will span 360ha, making it the largest mixed-use business district outside the city centre.The district has been earmarked as a car-lite district.And new MRT lines will also be completed, such as the Jurong Region Line in 2027 and Cross Island Line in the 2030s.Mr Tan is confident the renewal plans will attract even more visitors to the area, which has been dubbed \"Orchard Road of the West\".\"When all the malls, neighbourhoods and parks are connected, people won't have to travel elsewhere to shop or play.

Suburban retail rents are expected to recover sooner because they are supported by the domestic catchment resident population.In the third quarter this year, prime retail rents islandwide decreased by 10.3 per cent year on year to average $27.40 per square foot (psf) per month, as safe-distancing measures and border controls remained in place.This drop was largely led by the 11 per cent fall in gross rents for prime retail spaces along the Orchard Road shopping belt, as stores there continued to struggle with the absence of international tourists, Knight Frank noted.Prime spaces refer to rental-yielding units between 350 and 1,500 square feet with the best frontage, connectivity, footfall and accessibility in a mall. Such spaces are typically located on the ground level of a mall or the basement level of a mall that is linked to an MRT station or bus interchange.In the Marina Centre, City Hall and Bugis region, gross rents of prime retail spaces tumbled by 13.5 per cent year on year to $25.40 psf per month on average for the third quarter.The city fringe, meanwhile, posted an 8.6 per cent decline from a year ago, to $23.40 psf per month.Propping up the retail market were the suburban areas, where rents started to stabilise during the July-September period.\"As more employees work from home, the malls located within residential population centres were visited by many for daily necessities and household sundries,\" the analysts wrote.The suburban region recorded the smallest drop in gross prime retail rents during the quarter, slipping 6.9 per cent on the year to average $26.60 psf per month.Quarter on quarter, rents of prime retail spaces in suburban areas also inched down by just 1.4 per cent, compared to the bigger declines of 6.4 per cent in Orchard, 7 per cent in Marina Centre, City Hall and Bugis, and 4.5 per cent in the city fringe.While traditional retailers such as Topshop at VivoCity and Robinsons at Jem closed during the latest quarter, there were also newcomers to the scene. For instance, 100-year-old Hong Kong bakery Hang Heung opened its first Singapore outlet at Ion Orchard, Knight Frank noted.Other notable retail openings in the three months include store expansions such as Foot Locker at Orchard Gateway @ Emerald and Decathlon at The Centrepoint.In August, retail sales - excluding motor vehicles - fell by 8.4 per cent year on year, according to figures released by the Department of Statistics last week.On a seasonally-adjusted month-on-month basis, total retail sales were higher by 1.4 per cent in August. Excluding motor vehicles, sales edged up 0.1 per cent on the month."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Both tenders closed with no bids.One of the major incentives is the URA letting the development have an increased total gross plot ratio of 5.6 for the site. This one-third increase in floor area is the equivalent of an additional 30-storey tower.It will sit on the site of an existing multi-storey carpark adjacent to the main building.Part of the DC for the extra floor area will be waived but capped at 10 per cent of the market value of the entire development, or 10 per cent of the estimated land value, based on the DC rate in last month's revision, depending on the approved mix of use for the development, whichever is lower, the URA said.Developers will also be given the option to adjust the site boundary to have a more regular-shaped site for optimal layout of the new tower.These incentives come on top of the typical planning incentives for conserved buildings, in which DCs are waived for enhancement in value arising from a change of site use and a lease top-up to 99 years.More than 7,000 buildings in Singapore have been conserved, many of which are in historic districts such as Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam.The decision to conserve the strata-titled Golden Mile Complex comes after inputs gathered over two years by the URA from various stakeholders, heritage groups and industry players.The 718-unit, 16-storey property in Beach Road is zoned for commercial use under the URA Master Plan 2014.Golden Mile Complex was completed in 1973 and has about 48 years left on its lease. It was one of the first developments in Singapore to feature offices, shops and residences.When it finds a developer in a collective sale, Golden Mile Complex will be Singapore's first large-scale strata-titled conserved development to be sold.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

CCDC is a regional subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corp Ltd (CSCEC), a state-owned company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Since its establishment in 1982, the Beijing-headquartered CSCEC has become the largest construction and investment conglomerate in the world, with a presence in over 100 countries and regions. As one of the most powerful investors in China, it has ranked first in the list of Engineering News-Record Top 250 Global Contractors for consecutive years and is first among industry counterparts in the Top 500 Global Brands 2019 by Brand Finance. CSCEC is also 18th on the 2020 list of Fortune Global 500 companies.Backed by its parent's outstanding strength and reputation, it is little wonder that CCDC has become one of Singapore's leading builders since its establishment here in 1992.In just under three decades, CCDC has succeeded in carving out a niche market with extraordinary results that include 17 institutional projects, 29,535 premium quality private homes and 43,618 HDB flats as well as hotels and commercial hubs. Today, 1 in 25 people here lives in a home built by CCDC.Over the years, CCDC has been honoured with 200 awards and accolades. Industry recognition includes 15 HDB Construction Awards (13 of them in consecutive years), 51 BCA Construction Excellence Awards, 31 Green Mark Awards and seven BCA Quality Excellence Awards in seven consecutive years. For 2020, CCDC won a BCA Quality Excellence Award - Quality Champion (Platinum) - and garnered four Construction Excellence Awards (Excellence) for the Woodlands Police Division, Oasis Terraces, Fengshan GreenVille and Yung Ho Spring I & II projects. It also bagged two Construction Excellence Awards (Merit) for Geylang Bahru MRT Station and West Ridges @ Bukit Batok. Coming in fourth on BCA's ranking of quality contractors, CCDC's CONQUAS score is also much higher than the industry average.In addition, CCDC also won the HDB Construction Award for the Fengshan GreenVille project this year.Following CSCEC's philosophy of obtaining trust in good faith, adhering to winning business opportunities and achieving brilliance through cooperation, the company has, through CCDC, constructed a total of 207 high quality projects - from urban infrastructure, government housing, commercial and medical centres to educational institutions, high-end hotels and private residences.These are built to suit the Singapore way of life and further strengthens the close Singapore-China relationship.In line with the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint - a national plan for economic and social development that provides guidance for building a better family, environment and future by 2030 - CCDC has created a new smart city concept to address sustainability challenges and contribute to urban harmony and smart development.It explored the application of construction technologies such as Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) and Integrated Digital Delivery, to ensure that the quality, safety, progress and environmental performance of all technology-driven projects meet and even exceed the requirements of local laws and regulations. CCDC also developed a safe and green management system in its projects.Driven by its creed of \"Life Foremost, Safety First, and Green and Gracious\", and in line with Singapore's national environmental health and safety regulations, as well as relevant international standards, it has worked hard to help build a beautiful Singapore.In its efforts to cultivate first-class construction talents for Singapore and neighbouring countries, CCDC also strives to build a diverse and inclusive workforce where employees from different cultural backgrounds work together and share development results.With the entire world mired in the Covid-19 pandemic since early 2020, CCDC has acted swiftly - from donating disease prevention materials to enacting preventative measures.In response to the Singapore government's pilot Quick Build Dormitories scheme to build dormitories with improved living standards, the company completed the construction of a new, high quality workers' dormitory in Choa Chu Kang after three months of relentless work. CCDC also worked with JTC Corporation to build a new dormitory at their Bulim Square project, adopting China's PPVC system and shipping the building material to Singapore to shorten the construction time.CCDC and its parent, CSCEC, will continue to pursue the strategic goals of building a world-class enterprise with strong value creation, steady industrial leadership, high international competitiveness, enormous brand influence and appealing soft power - with the purpose of building sustainable cities. Being socially responsible, both entities are committed to working closely with all stakeholders in Singapore and neighbouring countries to create a happy living environment together, realise the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint and help build a community with a shared future. Its Witness Happiness sustainability report elaborates on its strategies, policies and practices with regards to its business, safety, social and environmental values.After a remarkable 28 years, CCDC is looking forward to an even brighter future filled with diverse possibilities by creating value and shaping a better living environment in Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It is owned by Clay Holdings II, which is in turn owned by Mr Lim, as well as Clay Holdings I, an entity established by funds managed by affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate.Mr Chong Kie Cheong, chairman and independent non-executive director of the manager, said: \"Notwithstanding the board and management team's efforts to maximise value for unitholders over the years, the Soilbuild Reit unit price has implied a high yield and was further impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\"After considering the uncertainty of a global recovery and the merits of this proposed trust scheme, we believe it represents a credible offer in the face of challenging market conditions and would like to present it to unitholders for their consideration.\"In a press statement on Monday, the offeror noted that Soilbuild Reit's ability to undertake distribution per unit (DPU)-accretive acquisitions has been limited, partly due to its high DPU yield, which has hindered its ability to bid competitively for third-party assets.\"Growing Soilbuild Reit through DPU-accretive acquisitions requires its DPU yield to trade sufficiently low and depends on its ability to effectively raise capital to fund such acquisitions. Support from minority unitholders to subscribe for their pro rata share of equity issuance is also critical,\" the offeror noted.In addition, the real estate investment trust (Reit) has a relatively low debt headroom of about $70 million, assuming a 40 per cent loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which is its target leverage level. Increasing LTV above this may raise the cost of debt and risk profile of the Reit, the offeror added.Given these constraints, the Reit has lagged in growth compared with its peers, its manager said. \"Since its initial public offering in August 2013, Soilbuild Reit has seen its total assets value grow by only 1.5 times, compared to the average of 1.8 times for industrial S-Reits.\"As such, the offeror believes that the proposed privatisation provides unitholders with an opportunity to exit the Reit and redeploy capital into other investments.Mr Lim, who is also co-founder of Soilbuild Group Holdings, said that given the various challenges and constraints faced by Soilbuild Reit, the group has considered many options and discussed potential transactions, including a privatisation, with parties comprising private equity firms, real estate funds, and real estate developers across Hong Kong/China, Australia and the United States over the past few years.\"We believe that this proposal by Blackstone presents the best option for minority unitholders based on the offers received, representing the highest price received,\" he said.Mr Lim is also of the view that Blackstone's proposal is the \"most credible\" and offers the \"greatest deal certainty in terms of timing and execution\", backed by its track record of privatisations.The latest announcement comes after the manager on Sept 4 said that Mr Lim had entered into a \"non-binding term sheet\" in relation to a possible transaction involving his and his family's interests in Soilbuild Reit. As at Dec 14, Mr Lim and his three sons own about 385.6 million units, representing a 30.3 per cent stake in Soilbuild Reit.The manager has extended its trading halt called on Dec 9.

This translates to a land rate of about $930 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr), analysts said.This represents the highest number of bids since the Holland Road commercial and residential site tender in May 2018, which drew 15 bids from 10 consortiums, Colliers International's head of research for Singapore, Tricia Song, noted.It is also much higher than the four to nine bids seen for private residential government land sales sites over the past 18 months, she added.The 21,514 square metre executive condominium (EC) site in Yishun Ave 9 drew the highest bid from Sing Holdings at $373.5 million (or a land rate of $576 psf ppr), out of a total of seven bids received by the HDB.Mr Karamjit Singh, chief executive of Showsuite Consultancy noted that both sites are targeted at the mass-market where the demand for homes remains the strongest.\"The top bid for the Tanah Merah site would require the developer to sell the new apartments for $1,700 to $1,800 psf, which is bullish as new units in that area are trading between $1,500 and $1,600 psf\", he said.Mr Ong Teck Hui, senior director of research and consultancy at JLL, said the site's key attraction is its proximity to the Tanah Merah MRT Station, and its relatively small plot size, requiring less capital outlay.\"The residential development at Tanah Merah Kechil Link is likely to be launched in late 2021 when buying demand could improve alongside an expected economic recovery,\" he added.The Tanah Merah Kechil Link site, which is slated for residential with commercial use on the first storey, can potentially yield about 265 units and 2,000 sq m of commercial space.The provision for commercial space is attractive as nearby amenities are limited, Ms Wong Siew Ying, PropNex head of research and content, said.The tender period for the Yishun EC site was given an extended public tender period of six months due to the pandemic. Tender durations for residential sites under the GLS programme are typically six to eight weeks.The 21,514 sq m EC site could yield about 600 homes, and is near Junction 9, a new mall.ERA Realty's head of research and consultancy Nicholas Mak noted that the top bid for the Yishun EC site \"shows that the developer is quite confident as the land rate is higher than the two EC sites launched for sale in 2019.\"\"At the land rate of $576 psf ppr, the estimated breakeven cost is about $1,000 to $1050 psf. The developer probably plans to launch new units at prices above $1,100 psf,\" he added.Confidence could also have been boosted by steady sales at the Piermont Grand, which is 76 per cent sold at median prices of over $1,100 psf, as well as a lack of ECs in the locality over the past six years, Ms Song noted.The Yishun Avenue 9 site is located at the edge of Yishun town, some 2km from the Yishun MRT station.\"It is the newest EC site in the locality to be offered on the GLS since 2014... so there could be some pent-up demand,\" she said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It said on Wednesday that group revenue performance to date remained within the guidance, and the expectation was now for revenue to be close to the midpoint of its earlier guidance.For its aerospace segment, ST Engineering said that a faster recovering domestic travel sector augurs well for its narrowbody maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) work.It also said it is pursuing passenger-to-freighter conversion opportunities, as there is market demand for dedicated freight aircraft, given limited passenger flights with belly load capacity. ST Engineering also noted that fleet retirements of passenger planes have added to feedstock availability.It secured around $600 million in aerospace orders for the quarter, taking the total for the first nine months of 2020 to about $2 billion.ST Engineering also secured around $1.1 billion in new orders for its electronics segment in the third quarter, taking its nine-month total to $2.3 billion. The orders include rail electronics projects, smart digital building solutions, and defence and public security projects.The company said its full workforce is back at its Singapore yards for the marine sector, and it completed numerous ship repair projects, rig repair and related fabrication works.It added that its defence land platform business remains steady. However, it noted that tenders for road construction and specialty vehicles are on hold.As at September 2020, its order book stood at $15.8 billion, slightly lower than the $15.9 billion in June. ST Engineering said it will focus on opportunities to capitalise on new demand arising from Covid-19, such as cybersecurity and sensors. It also has group-wide efficiency and productivity initiatives on track to target to offset the effect of lower level of government support in 2021.On its reorganisation, the company said the commercial cluster will drive the group's international growth in commercial aerospace, urban solutions and satellite communications. This cluster combines into one integral unit the group's smart-city technologies and capabilities, which now reside in the four sectors.The commercial aerospace team will continue to drive long-term growth of the aerospace businesses in aero structures and systems, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), and aviation-asset management. Urban solutions and satellite communications teams will drive the group's smart-city business growth, said ST Engineering.The defence & public cluster will integrate capabilities in digital systems and cyber, land systems, marine and defence aerospace. This cluster will focus on serving the evolving needs of its customers in defence and public security, and in critical infrastructure segments. It will also continue to pursue growth in international defence, and public safety and security businesses.Vincent Chong, chief executive of ST Engineering said: \"The environment today is one where technological advancements and shifting customer demands are catalysing disruptive business models and rapidly transforming the competitive landscape. The time is now right for us to create a sharper and more agile organisation that will be highly attuned and responsive to our customers' needs in the new world.\"The change in organisation will be reflected in its financial results for the first half-year to June 2021, with financial reporting to be based on the new operating segments.However, it is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated net tangible assets per share and earnings per share of ST Engineering for the current financial year, the company said.ST Engineering shares were trading up three cents or 0.8 per cent at $3.83 at 11.23am on Wednesday."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It was independently valued at $1.18 billion by Cushman & Wakefield as at end-2020.The $1.27 billion value commands a 7.6 per cent premium over this valuation and exceeds the property's purchase consideration of $1 billion by 26.1 per cent.After taking into account the estimated divestment fee and other divestment-related expenses, OUE C-Reit is expecting to net about $262.6 million of proceeds.In a late night filing on Monday, OUE C-Reit's manager said this will provide it the financial flexibility to pare down debt, undertake accretive acquisitions of higher-yielding assets or asset enhancement initiatives, and redeem outstanding convertible perpetual preferred units. It may also use the net proceeds to commence a distribution per unit accretive unit buy-back programme to enhance long-term returns to unitholders, or to distribute as capital gains.Assuming the estimated net proceeds from the divestment are used to repay loans, the Reit's aggregate leverage is expected to improve from 40.3 per cent as at end-September 2020 to 33.6 per cent on a pro forma basis.A limited liability partnership known as BPH Propco has been formed between the Reit and Allianz's SPV Acre Angsana, with DBS Trustee as trustee of the Reit. The OUE Bayfront property's sale will be conducted through BPH Propco, which OUE C-Reit and Allianz will each hold a 50 per cent interest in.The Reit manager and OUE Commercial Property Management will be respectively appointed as asset manager and property manager to BPH Propco.DBS Trustee has also agreed to guarantee a minimum net property income (NPI) of $50 million and $52.5 million for the first and second year, respectively, following completion of the divestment and subject to an aggregate cap of $6 million.Based on the OUE Bayfront property's annualised NPI of $45.8 million for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2020 and the agreed value, the estimated net property yield is 3.6 per cent per annum.Post completion of the divestment, the manager says OUE C-Reit will continue to be underpinned by the resilient office segment, which contributes 57.8 per cent to the Reit's total portfolio rental revenue on a pro forma basis. Singapore properties continue to anchor the portfolio, comprising about 90.4 per cent of total assets, it added.\"This acquisition presents us with a unique opportunity to add a marquee prime office asset into our portfolio. We are confident that the OUE Bayfront property, with its high-quality offering and strategic location, will continue to enjoy strong demand from occupiers seeking prime office space in Singapore,\" said Danny Phuan, Asia Pacific head of acquisitions for Allianz. Allianz has separately announced the agreed transaction value for the 50 per cent interest in OUE Bayfront is $634 million subject to closing, which is expected to happen at end-February 2021. The real estate company issued a press statement on Tuesday (Jan 19) confirming previous market speculations that the acquisition is on behalf of the National Pension Service of Korea, in addition to the Allianz group of companies. JLL acted as adviser on the sale, said the real estate consultancy in a media statement on the same day. Its head of capital markets for Singapore, Lim Ting, sees the transaction as \"indicative of deeper investor confidence in the long-term prospects for quality assets in the Singapore office market\".

This entity will develop and incubate projects as a key pipeline for CLIM.Under the proposed scheme, for every one share held in CapitaLand, eligible shareholders will receive one CLIM share, between 0.155 and 0.143 unit of CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT) and cash of $0.951.The implied value per share for CapitaLand's shareholders is $4.102, based on current share capital. This is 24 per cent above the last traded price of CapitaLand and represents a premium of 27 per cent to the one-month volume-weighted average price.CapitaLand shares last traded at $3.31. The company called for a trading halt before the stock market opened on Monday.Mr Lee Chee Koon, CapitaLand group chief executive officer, will be taking the helm of CLIM as group CEO.\"This restructuring is about sharpening our focus and positioning ourselves to be an asset-light and capital-efficient business,\" he said.\"We have made good progress to pivot ourselves to the new economy sectors, expanding our global footprint and growing our fee-income business. We are now taking the next step to create a leading global real estate investment manager with dominance in Asia, especially through our track record in the public Reits space.\"As listed Reims generally trade at a premium to their NAVs (net asset values) in the capital markets, we are confident that CLIM will be able to drive returns for our shareholders given its scale, capabilities and a strong ecosystem,\" he said.Mr Lee added: \"The real estate development business is subject to longer gestation periods and not adequately appreciated by the public markets. With a privately held development business, we will be able to better ride property development cycles to optimise returns across asset classes and geographies.Under the proposed scheme, CapitaLand will distribute about 48 per cent of shares in CLIM to all its shareholders, excluding CLA.As this is a one-for-one distribution, the share ownership ratio in CLIM immediately after the issuance of the CLIM shares will be equal to the eligible shareholders' existing ownership in CapitaLand. CapitaLand will continue to own a 52 per cent interest upon listing of CLIM. Its current 28.9 per cent stake in CICT will be reduced to 22.9 per cent.CLA will not participate in the distribution of the CICT units, and its entitlement to the CICT units will be distributed to the eligible shareholders as part of the scheme.CLIM at its inception will be a fully integrated Reim with funds and property management capabilities across multiple asset classes and a spectrum of private and listed funds. The managers of all the listed real estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts, as well as selected unlisted funds currently managed by CapitaLand, will be held under CLIM.These funds have a total fund AUM of about $78 billion as at end-December 2020, having grown at a compound annual growth rate of 15 per cent since 2017. CLIM's investment management business will be a scalable and global business focused on fee-related earnings (FRE) and FUM growth, said the announcement.CapitaLand's full stack lodging management business, which encompasses the leading global serviced residence management platform under The Ascott Limited, will also become a part of CLIM.CLIM will hold the stakes in the listed Reits and business trusts, as well as the managed private funds. It will also have within its investment portfolio over $10.1 billion worth of income-generating properties.The remaining real estate development-related business and assets under CapitaLand, with a pro forma NAV of about $6.1 billion, will be held privately by CLA upon completion of the scheme.The proposed deal will allow eligible shareholders to realise immediate value upside from the development business, which is a segment requiring commitment of capital for longer-term gestation projects, said CapitaLand.Mr Ng Kee Choe, chairman of CapitaLand, said: \"This proposed restructuring is a significant and important milestone in CapitaLand's transformation. It will provide the impetus for us to further expand and scale up our asset and investment management, and lodging businesses whilst benefitting from the pipeline of projects from CapitaLand as part of the ecosystem. It will also extend our market leadership in the Asian real estate investment management business.\"CLA chairman Wong Kan Seng said: \"As one of Asia's largest diversified real estate groups, this restructuring will play a key role in setting CLIM on a focused and high growth trajectory. It will also provide flexibility for the development business to pursue longer gestation and capital-intensive projects.\"As a major shareholder of CLIM upon completion of the proposed transaction, the privatised CapitaLand and its development arm will support the growth of CLIM as a committed development partner, and by contributing a pipeline of assets that the privatised CapitaLand will incubate. Both entities will have substantial cross-platform synergies and complementary strengths to seize growth opportunities in the market.\"Mr Jason Leow, president, Singapore & International of CapitaLand group, will be the CEO of CapitaLand Development, the development business arm of the privatised entity, post the restructure.The scheme is subject to regulatory conditions, the approval of the High Court and CapitaLand's independent shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting and at a scheme meeting. It is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter this year.J.P. Morgan (S.E.A.) Ltd and Allen & Gledhill are acting as financial adviser and legal counsel to CapitaLand respectively.

This will create more jobs here, said Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat on Friday (March 5).The number of maritime tech start-ups will also more than triple from 30 to 100 by 2025, while a new programme will be launched to develop leaders with knowledge of key maritime issues and strong business networks.Speaking in Parliament during the debate on the budget of the Ministry of Transport, Mr Chee said: \"We aim to bring in $20 billion in total business spending commitments from maritime companies from 2020 to 2024, and create more jobs and opportunities for our people.\"These will be in areas including maritime law and arbitration, ship management and marine insurance.He outlined three targets for the local maritime ecosystem to strive towards - to be integrated, innovative and inclusive.The maritime sector here did well last year, handling 36.9 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), and growing in scale and diversity, said Mr Chee.\"We attracted 11 new shipping groups to Singapore, and worked with eight maritime companies to expand their operations here,\" he said.To build on the momentum and seize new opportunities to stay ahead of the competition, the maritime sector here has to become an integrated ecosystem.Providing an update on the mega Tuas Port project, Mr Chee said: \"We are on track to complete the first phase of land reclamation works by end of this year.\"The Tuas Port project will bring together port operator PSA's operations in Pasir Panjang, Keppel and Brani, and when fully operational, will be as large as two Ang Mo Kios.It will be able to handle up to 65 million TEUs a year, 50 per cent more than Singapore's current capacity.The facility will be fully automated, with features such as automated cranes and driverless vehicles.\"These will more than double our labour productivity at Tuas, compared to our City Terminals, and create many skilled jobs for Singaporeans in the port sector. It will also be a greener port, with a 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions intensity,\" he said.The concept of integration will also extend beyond the port, to key sectors like advanced manufacturing, cold chain and logistics, said Mr Chee.This will form a Tuas Port ecosystem where containers can be moved directly between ships and factories, without additional delays or handling costs.\"We are also enhancing digital integration to facilitate data exchange, helping companies to enjoy greater convenience, reduce costs and save time,\" he added.The Government plans to develop the Tuas South region for industrial use over the next two decades, and will continue to explore viable transport options for workers there, and also work with the Ministry of National Development to increase public housing options in the west, he said.Mr Chee told the House that the maritime sector has to be innovative. The Government will work with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to push research efforts and scale up their operations.\"We will increase the cap of co-funding support for maritime technology SMEs, from 50 per cent currently to 70 per cent, and encourage industry players to share expertise and resources to co-develop scalable solutions. Eligible projects by industry consortiums will also receive up to 70 per cent co-funding support,\" he said.The Maritime and Port Authority will top up $15 million to the Maritime Innovation and Technology Fund, bringing the total funds available for maritime research and development, as well as product development, to $100 million.\"We aim to more than triple the number of maritime tech start-ups supported under the Pier71 funding programme, from 30 to 100 by 2025,\" said Mr Chee.\"Our goal is to be the top maritime start-up hub in the world, the Silicon Valley for maritime technology.\"Mr Chee also said that the maritime sector should be inclusive, and create a diverse range of jobs for people with different backgrounds and skill sets.\"We want to attract and train more Singaporeans to take on seafaring and shore-based jobs,\" he said.Moving forward, there will also be opportunities in the sector in areas such as environmental sustainability, systems engineering, cyber security and data analytics.A new programme will also be launched to groom future leaders for the maritime sector here, said Mr Chee.\"We are starting a new Maritime Leadership Programme to train up to 30 local maritime managers for the first two runs, to hone their leadership skills, build global perspectives on key maritime issues, and strengthen their business networks locally and abroad,\" he said.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

It will be occupying seven floors from levels 24 to 30.Other tenants include CapitaLand's co-working partner, The Work Project, which will be on level 21 to operate the company's so-called \"core-flex\" solutions for tenants.CapitaLand Singapore's chief executive Tan Yew Chin said \"core-flex\" solutions integrate traditional office space (core) and flexible space (flex) in an innovative workplace.Under this model, tenants can opt for either in the building.About 10 per cent of the building's net lettable area has been set aside for flexible workspaces.Mr Tan said: \"CapitaSpring represents CapitaLand's vision for the future of work with fully integrated core-flex solutions, tech-enabled frictionless user experience and community-centric programming. As Covid-19 changes the norms of work, the forward-looking features of CapitaSpring have strengthened the development's value proposition as a flexible, sustainable and connected workplace ecosystem.\"He added that the company was confident the development's take-up rates will be similar to, or better than, CapitaLand's 79 Robinson Road project in the Tanjong Pagar CBD micro-market, which should reach 90 per cent committed occupancy.There will be a food centre on CapitaSpring's second and third levels with stallholders from Market Street Food Centre returning upon completion. A pan-European garden bistro, a rooftop restaurant and social bar, as well as 12,000 sq ft of retail space, will be other features.Occupants and visitors will also have access to a four-storey garden called Green Oasis, situated 100m above the ground, and a rooftop urban farm - Singapore's highest.CapitaSpring will house the 299-unit Citadines serviced residences spread over eight floors and managed by The Ascott Limited.Mr Tony Tan, chief executive of the manager of CICT, said CapitaSpring will be the only premium Grade A office development in the CBD being completed this year.He said: \"Driven in part by the limited CBD office supply, CapitaSpring has attracted healthy interest from tenants and prospective tenants. To date, committed office tenants are mainly from the legal, banking and financial services sectors.\"ERA Realty head of research and consultancy Nicholas Mak described CapitaSpring's current occupancy rate as \"decent\" given the Covid-19 pandemic.He said: \"Many developments advertise their spaces around a year and a half before its completion. The period where CapitaSpring advertised their spaces probably collided with the Covid-19 pandemic. Work-from-home culture has become more prevalent among industries that provide this option for its white-collar workers.\"Companies in these industries might feel reluctant to commit to an office space and this, in turn, impacts retail companies whose sales depend on the office crowds. Thus, they might not be confident to lease a space.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "SINGAPORE - Singapore attracted about $17.2 billion in fixed asset investments in 2020, despite weathering its worst recession since independence as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.This beat the Economic Development Board's (EDB) medium- to long-term target of $8 billion to $10 billion and exceeded 2019's haul of $15.2 billion in fixed asset investments. The investments secured in 2020 are the most sizeable since 2008, when the EDB pulled in more than $18 billion.Last year's commitments were bolstered by large capital investments in the electronics, chemicals, and research and development sectors, the EDB shared at its year-in-review on Wednesday (Jan 20).Speaking to the media on Wednesday morning, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said: \"Our efforts to keep our borders open, maintain external connectivity and ensure business continuity have given global companies the confidence to continue to site their projects in Singapore.\"In addition, Singapore has been able to attract key projects, especially those dealing with high-value and knowledge-intensive products, on the back of its strong regulatory system and intellectual property (IP) regime, he said.The Republic garnered $6.8 billion in total business expenditure per annum in 2020, which was lower than the $9 billion seen the year before.When the projects from the investments secured in 2020 are fully implemented, they will create 19,352 new jobs over the next five years, with a projected contribution of $31.2 billion in value-added per annum. Value added refers to the direct contribution made by a company to Singapore's gross domestic product, and includes components such as employees' wages and corporate earnings.In comparison, 2019's investments were predicted to create close to 33,000 openings and to contribute $29.4 billion in expected value-added per annum.Notably, the R&D industry is expected to add more than 4,200 employment opportunities while the headquarters and professional services segment will contribute more than 3,000 openings over the next few years.\"Our focus will continue to be on placing our workers in jobs that are created. The companies remain committed to working closely with us to prepare the local workforce for the available positions,\" said Mr Chan.Of the more than 19,000 jobs that will be created over the next few years, 45 per cent are in production and include roles such as process engineers, administrative assistants and supply chain executives.Close to a quarter of the new openings will be in digital roles, such as cloud developers, software engineers and cyber-security specialists.Addressing questions on the number and types of jobs created, Mr Chan said that while some sectors may have high investment figures yet fewer jobs, these are high-quality positions. At the same time, there are some investments of lower value that create more jobs.However, he emphasised that the focus should not solely be on the investment amount or the number of jobs created.\"We want to secure investments that make us a critical part of the global value chain in different industries, so that we cannot be easily bypassed, so that we have the knowledge, we have the IP... to make sure that we can entrench ourselves in the global value chain.\"Singapore's robust investment picture came despite the challenging business environment globally. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development had noted that global foreign direct investment flows fell 49 per cent in the first half of 2020 and a 30 per cent to 40 per cent decline was predicted for the full year.However, Singapore has defied market expectations, with companies continuing to place their roots here.\"Companies that invest in Singapore continue to take the long-term perspective and they have trust and confidence in Singapore's fundamentals, the prospects for Asia, and clearly also... a very deep affinity for Singapore and the operations they have here,\" said Dr Beh Swan Gin, chairman of EDB, who noted that many of the companies which made investment commitments have existing operations here.Singapore saw a surge in investment commitments coming from local companies, which accounted for 17.3 per cent of capital investments in 2020, higher than the 8.2 per cent in the previous year. The United States overtook Europe as the Republic's largest investor region, with 53.4 per cent of Singapore's fixed asset commitments in 2020. In contrast, Europe accounted for 17.1 per cent of investments secured in 2020, compared with 47.4 per cent in 2019.Mr Chan noted that Singapore's portfolio of investments has become more diversified both in sectors and region over the past few years and this adds to the resilience of its economy.Furthermore, the Covid-19 pandemic has also given rise to a greater appreciation of supply chain resilience in making investment decisions and this has reinforced Singapore's competitiveness over the past year given its assurance of a robust supply chain system.For example, many logistics companies have strengthened their investments here for this reason and more high-value products and time-sensitive products are coming through Singapore.EDB managing director Chng Kai Fong said that given Singapore's trade exposure and investment-driven nature, it always has to keep up with the latest trends to retain investor interest.One new area that it has pivoted towards in the past few years is innovation, to create products and services out of Singapore, he said, and the EDB is doing so in ways such as nurturing a large local enterprise ecosystem.\"We think that when you start new ventures out of Singapore, that's when the IP is created here, that's where jobs are created around product lines, and we're very happy that today... we have many product lines and services that are headquartered out of Singapore,\" Mr Chng said.The EDB highlighted that digital capabilities were built across sectors to facilitate the development of new technologies and adoption of advanced manufacturing in 2020.It also made progress in promoting innovation and the creation of new businesses and products and in the development of growth sectors such as agri-food and mobility.Dr Beh said that the EDB does not anticipate to have the same level of fixed asset investments in 2021 as it did in 2020 but it will \"hopefully be in line\" with its medium-term goals.He noted that every eight to 10 years, there tends to be a surge in fixed asset investments in Singapore, as a result of a wave in investments from the semiconductor and energy and chemicals industries to increase their capacity to meet the growing demand.The numbers for 2020 could have been stronger, Dr Beh said, but some projects were delayed due to impact on the energy and chemical sectors last year, adding that these projects could proceed when the demand picture is more stable.For the medium- to long-term, the EDB's yearly targets are fixed asset investments of between $8 billion and $10 billion, $5 billion to $7 billion of total business expenditure per annum, and 16,000 to 18,000 new jobs.Mr Chan acknowledged that while the EDB has done well in the past year, the road ahead will be challenging, given that the global situation remains mired in uncertainty.Nevertheless, the country heads into 2021 with cautious optimism for its economic prospects, he said, adding that if things go well, there could be some recovery in the global economy towards the second half of the year.\"However, we should not think that the road ahead will be a walk in the park because we have managed to do well up till now,\" Mr Chan cautioned.\"While Singapore continues to be an attractive investment destination, we also need to be mindful that things can change very quickly. In order to stay resilient, we must continue to be flexible and adaptable - Government, companies and workers.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Tender prices could rise within a range of 10 per cent to 15 per cent, which is higher than its earlier forecast range of 6 per cent to 10 per cent.The real estate consultancy noted that construction output rose marginally by 5 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the fourth quarter of last year as more construction activities resumed. That said, border restrictions on South Asian migrant workers implemented in April and May have slowed construction activities and will likely affect output for the upcoming quarters.Labour costs have thus risen due to the lack of skilled labour, with significant cost increases seen in mechanical and electrical works.In Singapore, prices of key construction materials such as steel bars rose by 36.2 per cent, with cement rising by 6 per cent, as at June this year compared with December. This is in line with price hikes found across other global markets due to the widespread disruption to global supply chains, sustained by high demand and competition for such materials.About $5.7 billion worth of construction contracts were awarded in the first quarter of this year, the real estate consultancy's Singapore market insight report showed. This is a marginal decline of 0.1 per cent from the previous quarter.More than 60 per cent of these projects were from the public sector, in areas such as residential, institutional and others, as well as civil engineering projects.Turner & Townsend expects the public sector to lead the majority of work demand for the rest of the year, even as the recent moderate increase in the supply of private homes from confirmed sites under the 2021 second half Government Land Sales (GLS) programme is likely to spur more private sector construction activity next year.Still, the report noted that it remains unclear if more applications from investors and developers will be made for land parcels currently available under the 2021 second half GLS reserve list, especially for larger plots like the Kampong Bugis Master Development site and the Woodlands Avenue 2 white site.In Asia, Singapore ranks behind Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macau in terms of costs to build, with an average cost of US$2,079 (S$2,830) per sq m to undertake construction.Singapore's construction market is the 37th most expensive globally. Tokyo ranks top as the costliest city to build globally, with an average cost of US$4,001 per sq m to build. This is followed by Hong Kong at US$3,894 per sq m, and San Francisco at US$3,720 per sq m.The Turner & Townsend survey analysed input costs, such as labour and materials, and charted the average construction cost per sq m for residential, commercial, hotels, industrial and retail buildings across 90 global markets."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The tender closes at 3pm on Nov 30.Ms Swee Shou Fern, executive director of investment advisory at Edmund Tie, said the building at the junction of Anson Road and Choon Guan Street \"represents the last strategic corner plot with main road frontage at the gateway of the Tanjong Pagar precinct\".The property, which is zoned for commercial use with height control of up to 250 metres, sits on a land area of about 6,976 sq m (75,089 sq ft) with 48 years left on the lease.It was developed by the Cheong family, who are related to the Cheongs who control Singapore-listed Hong Fok Corp.The collective sale process began in October 2019 and was supposed to be wrapped up by last October but it took a further 10 months due to the pandemic and after an extension was granted under new measures implemented last year.International Plaza meets the criteria to qualify for the Central Business District Incentive Scheme, which allows properties to have their gross floor area increased by 25 to 30 per cent depending on the proposed land use.It has applied to the Urban Redevelopment Authority to increase the gross floor area by 25 per cent, with 60 per cent of the development gross floor area earmarked for commercial use and 40 per cent for non-commercial such as apartments and a hotel, Ms Swee said.If approved, the site can be redeveloped with a gross floor area of 167,826.16 sq m (1,806,464 sq ft) or an equivalent plot ratio of 24.06.Ageing office developments in the CBD can tap this scheme to convert to a residential mixed development, allowing developers to take advantage of a robust housing market, said Mr Wong Xian Yang, head of research for Singapore at Cushman & Wakefield.\"In view of Singapore's expected strong recovery, en-bloc developments that launch early could enjoy a first-mover advantage,\" he added.An unnamed developer undertook to bid at least $1.508 billion for a government land site in Marina View in June. The white site is intended for mixed use with residential, hotel, commercial and/or serviced apartments. The tender closes at noon on Sept 21.Depending on what International Plaza's proposed use is, the Marina View government land sales (GLS) site may be a rival, Mr Wong said, adding: \"GLS sites are a more straightforward route for land acquisition.\"But there is more flexibility for International Plaza, as it can be developed into a fully commercial development or a mixed development.\"Given their large quantum, both Marina View and International Plaza would appeal to larger developers or joint ventures. For the Marina View site, the winning bid is expected to be closer to $2 billion.\"Ms Tay Huey Ying, JLL Singapore's head of research and consultancy, noted that developers may deem it \"advantageous to acquire sites for office development before land prices surge\" on a recovery in the commercial market."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Seeing as land is a scarce resource in many cities around the world, this may seem like a pipe dream, especially since purchasing a property usually requires a huge capital outlay. But wait, there is a surprisingly affordable financial instrument that can help you circumvent this, let you catch your breath and even earn you money while you're sleeping or away on a trip: Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits). Passive income through real estate investing is one of the more popular paths investors who want to put their money to work for them can take. Here's what you need to know:These are real estate companies that own, operate or finance income-producing properties, such as hotels, offices or residences. Listed on the stock exchange, Reits have benefits other investment vehicles don't have, such as allowing individual investors to earn dividends from investments without buying, managing or financing any properties themselves. By investing in Reits, individuals can enjoy a steady stream of passive income without the downsides usually tied to owning a property. At present, the Singapore Reit market is one of the biggest in Asia, with 42 listed Reits and a market capitalisation of over S$100 billion. While this may sound daunting to get into, digital wealth manager Syfe takes the ease of real estate investing further. Syfe not only allows investors a convenient and affordable way to diversify their portfolio through real estate, but the Syfe REIT+ portfolio itself is also diversified with assets ranging from offices and hospitals to logistic warehouses and data centres.Launched in partnership with the Singapore Exchange (SGX), Syfe REIT+ is designed to closely replicate the performance of the iEdge S-REIT Leaders Index. Like the index, which tracks the largest and most liquid REITs in Singapore, Syfe REIT+ allows investors access to a broad range of quality Reits and exposure to all the properties owned by them.What's more, there is no minimum investment and no brokerage charges or a lock-in period - plus, you can withdraw anytime.\"It is a simple way to invest with all the technical information openly shared,\" says Syfe REIT+ investor Mr Daniel Soh, 56. \"In my search for ways to invest in real estate and Reits, I learnt that all investments come with risks. Syfe's Reit+ is the perfect combination of a sound selection of Reits with good risk management and low management fees,\" he says.The portfolio focuses on quality REITs with sound fundamentals and long-term growth potential. These include blue-chip REITs like CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust that manages shopping malls as well as offices like Bugis Junction, Asia Square Tower 2 and Raffles City, and Mapletree Commercial Trust that operates Vivocity and Mapletree Business City. It also includes Mapletree Logistics Trust, which owns warehouses and logistics centres across nine markets in the Asia-Pacific. Of these, warehouses associated with the boom in e-commerce have been especially popular investments, thanks to the rise in digitisation since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\"I trust Syfe to do the technical heavy lifting and adjustments when the market falls, so my risks are managed. When Covid-19 struck and Reits started falling, I saw how my REIT+ with risk management eased the impact,\" says Mr Soh.The REIT+ with risk management portfolio is a unique combination of REITs and Singapore government bonds via the Nikko AM ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund. During periods of volatility, Syfe's proprietary algorithm lowers your risk exposure by reducing the allocation to REITs and increasing the allocation to government bonds. This has the effect of cushioning your portfolio during market crashes. When markets recover, the algorithm once again increases the percentage of REIT holdings within the portfolio.To cater to younger investors seeking higher potential returns, Syfe also has a 100% REITs portfolio. Mr Marcel Tanumihardja, 25, was drawn by this maximum exposure to REITs.\"As a young adult, my overall portfolio leans toward equities. I decided to invest in the real estate sector as a diversifier to improve my risk-return profile,\" she says. \"The return is also around the line that [Syfe] has predicted for me.\"The average annual return over the past eight years has been 8.74 per cent. Amid the pandemic, the Syfe REIT+ dividend yield hit 4.5 per cent in 2020. The estimated dividend yield for 2021 is higher at 5.1 per cent. This points to the resilience of the Reits sector, which should see its outlook improve as vaccinations gather pace.Dividends are automatically reinvested for you as well. Based on Syfe's internal calculations, this can add an extra 0.5 per cent in annual returns. This covers Syfe's management fees which start from 0.35 per cent p.a.Gone are the days when huge capital commitment was required to get into real estate investing. With no minimum investment and low fees, Syfe REIT+ is an easy and efficient way for anyone to heed their parents' age-old advice of investing in property.For more information, visit www.syfe.com."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It is hoping that landlords will be required to extend a minimum of 50 per cent of rent support for retailers during this heightened alert phase, the spokesman added.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Most recently, about 86 per cent of the 487 units at Pasir Ris 8, which is next to the Pasir Ris MRT station, was sold in the first week of the project's launch in July.What exactly is an integrated or mixed-use development? It is most commonly used to describe a development with residential and commercial components, linked to an MRT station. Sometimes, it may also be connected to a bus interchange. The residential component is usually built on top of the mall.The concept bears similarities to that of an integrated transport hub (ITH), although the latter does not necessarily include a residential component. The authorities define an ITH as a fully air-conditioned bus interchange that is seamlessly linked to an MRT station and adjoining commercial developments.The Covid-19 pandemic led to the rapid adoption of the work-from-home practices among white-collar workers. There were also several rounds of restrictions, such as the circuit breaker last year and the two heightened-alert phases this year.Individuals who live near a shopping centre are able to meet their dining and retail needs easily, especially when such pandemic-related restrictions are in place.Furthermore, residential properties near MRT stations have always been popular with buyers due to the ease of connectivity.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Demand for homes within integrated developments therefore increased over the past year, as they enable residents to access both retail premises and an MRT station.That being said, one may argue that individuals working from home most of the time will no longer need public transport to commute to the office daily. The draw of an MRT station in their home-purchase decisions may thus diminish in such cases.CHANGING PREFERENCESLooking at the red-hot demand for the recently launched Pasir Ris 8, it is easy to forget that the apartment units in integrated developments have not always been this popular.When some of the earlier integrated developments were introduced more than 15 years ago, some homebuyers in fact preferred condominiums without the attached malls.Those buyers favoured more or larger recreational facilities - such as tennis courts, jogging tracks, swimming pools and function rooms - which were usually found in larger condominium developments. Some also felt that condominiums provide more privacy as they are not situated on top of busy malls.Nonetheless, homebuyers' preferences do change over time, especially given the impact of the pandemic.PRICE PREMIUMThe prices of apartments in integrated developments are usually higher than those of nearby comparable condominiums with the same land tenure and similar age. In our study, the condominiums that were compared to the apartments in integrated developments, are not linked to any mall or MRT station.Some integrated developments can command price premiums ranging from 4 to 30 per cent, against comparable condominiums nearby. However, there are also a few with only a small or no price premium.Wider premiums were observed in cases where there had been a dearth of new private residential launches for a number of years in that area before the integrated development's apartments came to the market. This is because the lack of fresh supply of private housing would lead to pent-up demand in the locality, on which the developer of the integrated development could then capitalise.In addition, the apartments in an integrated development would enjoy a bigger price premium if they are launched in the midst of a bullish market that is fuelled by buoyant demand and ample liquidity.An example would be The Orchard Residences, situated atop the Ion Orchard mall, with 56 storeys housing 175 luxury apartments. As one of the earlier integrated developments, launched in 2007, it was also the only integrated development and the tallest building along Orchard Road.The Orchard Residences thus commanded one of the highest price premiums among integrated developments. In the 12-month period after the project's launch, its median transacted price of S$3,064 psf was 25 per cent above the median price of nearby comparable 99-year leasehold condominiums transacted in the primary market.The median price of the 99-year leasehold Orchard Residences was even higher than the overall median transacted prices of new freehold condominiums in the Cairnhill area.THREATS TO INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENTSStill, the bigger threat to apartments in integrated developments are not other condominiums, but technological innovations embraced by consumers, such as in online shopping and ride-hailing services.E-commerce has already proven to be a serious contender in the retail space. As online shopping becomes more prevalent and orders get delivered more quickly, that will erode the attraction of living above a mall.Similarly, with the improving public transport network and the emergence of more vehicular options such as buses, LRT, taxi and ride-hailing services, the advantage that residential properties next to MRT stations have over those located farther away will likely shrink.In addition, retail malls near MRT stations typically see high footfall. This can be both a boon and a bane during a pandemic, as crowded places will have a higher risk of a Covid-19 cluster forming. If a mall is affected, that could cause some inconvenience to the residents living in the apartments above it.In conclusion, homes that are part of integrated developments have maintained their popularity. As the cost of car ownership remains on an uptrend and the MRT network cements itself as a fundamental part of Singapore's transportation system, such residential properties will continue to appeal to both owner-occupiers and investors in the years ahead.The writer is head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty Network.READ MORE:Private residential hotspots: A housing renaissance emergesHousehunt August 2021: Projects currently on the marketNew or resale homes?

However, it has over the past few years received \"consistent feedback\" from unit holders to reconsider its syariah-compliance requirement, the manager said.Consequently, it has decided that the change will be beneficial to the Reit, enabling it to expand the network of available banks and lenders from which to obtain financing and gain access to more competitive loans, it said.Removing syariah compliance will also enable Sabana Reit to appeal to a wider pool of investors at a time when the total percentage of units held by syariah investors has decreased to just 2 per cent as at March 31 this year from 12.3 per cent as at Dec 31, 2011, the manager said.The change will also widen the Reit's exposure to a larger pool of \"potentially higher-rental paying tenants\" such as those in the food and beverage, as well as banking, finance and insurance industries.Syariah compliance denotes that a financial product, service or activity complies with the principles of Islamic law. Examples of non-permissible financial activities are those that are interest-based or businesses that are in the alcohol, pork, entertainment and tobacco industries.To comply with syariah principles, the manager currently has to ensure that the total rental income from lessees, tenants and/or sub-tenants engaging in activities prohibited under syariah guidelines do not exceed 5 per cent per annum of Sabana Reit's gross revenue.As Sabana Reit has been listed for more than three years, unit holders' approval is not required under the listing manual and the trust deed, said the manager.The manager said it was \"grateful to its syariah investors and appreciates their strong support for the Reit\".Separately, Sabana Reit on Thursday announced a distribution per unit (DPU) of 1.48 cents for the half year ended June 30, more than three times its DPU of 0.47 cent a year ago.Gross revenue rose 14.1 per cent to $39.1 million, driven by contributions from higher occupancies at New Tech Park, 23 Serangoon North Avenue 5, and 10 Changi South Street 2, the manager said.Overall occupancy levels were 83.4 per cent as at June 30, up 6.1 percentage points from 77.3 per cent a year ago. Net property income rose 23.2 per cent to $25.7 million for the six-month period, from $20.9 million.Sabana Reit units closed at 44 cents, up one cent or 2.3 per cent on Thursday."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

That works out to $1,379 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr) - which many analysts noted was \"on the low side\". They said Boulevard View, an entity linked to IOI Properties Group, is most likely the party that triggered the release for the site's sale. IOI Properties did not respond to The Straits Times' queries by press time on Tuesday. The Malaysia-listed group is developing another white site in Central Boulevard which it acquired for $2.57 billion in November 2016 after triggering its release with a minimum bid of $1.536 billion. That worked out to a land rate of $1,689 psf ppr.\"The hollowing out of the CBD during the pandemic, and the slow and interrupted return to CBD offices may have dampened the confidence in city living by developers,\" Ms Tricia Song, CBRE's head of research for South-east Asia, noted. The bid from Boulevard View is lower than the most recent Government Land Sales residential sites sold in the CBD, Ms Song pointed out.In September 2019, One Bernam's site in Tanjong Pagar received four bids, with a top bid of $1,462 psf ppr, while Midtown Modern's site in Tan Quee Lan Street received two bids, with a top bid of $1,535 psf ppr, she said.Ms Song said Tuesday's lone bid is also in \"stark contrast to the competitive bidding in five suburban or city fringe residential sites\" so far this year.\"The sites in Lentor Central, Tampines Street 62, Tengah Garden EC (executive condominium), Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 and Northumberland each garnered seven to 15 bids, and the bid prices were above expectations,\" she said.She attributed lacklustre interest for the Marina View site to competition from unsold residential units in the CBD and potential new supply from redevelopment there. The white site - intended for a mixed-use development with residential, hotel, commercial and/or serviced apartments - was released under the reserve list of the first-half 2021 Government Land Sales programme. It can yield 905 private homes, 2,000 sq m in gross floor area of commercial space, and 540 hotel rooms.The tender could have been affected by very high total development costs, which could pose significant risks to the developer. While the economy is recovering, the pandemic still poses uncertainties, Mr Ong Teck Hui, senior director of research and consultancy at JLL, said.Developer participation was \"below expectation\", due in part to uncertainty over the resumption of global travel and the ongoing manpower crunch in the construction sector, Mr Wong Xian Yang, head of research for Singapore at Cushman & Wakefield, said. Mr Calvin Li, head of transaction advisory services, hotels and hospitality at JLL Asia-Pacific, said the absence of more bidders suggests that \"most investors continue to be cautious about... potentially high development costs associated with an upscale or luxury hotel\".ERA's head of research and consultancy Nicholas Mak flagged higher development risks due to the expected longer development timeframe, and potential fallout from the financial troubles of Chinese property giant Evergrande Group.\"This may have put some developers off gigantic-ticket projects,\" he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

If left unchecked, this will affect affordability and put flats out of reach for some buyers,\" he said.However, Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, pointed out that the government had recently clarified that the majority of buyers did not have to pay any COV, with the median COV remaining at S$0.\"This information can serve as a market indicator for both buyers and sellers. It may help to alleviate the anxieties of some buyers who may be worried about paying high COVs or 'overpaying' for certain flats,\" she said.THE STRAITS TIMES"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This is a lot more significant than domestic demand in terms of GDP.\"He said external demand is facing growing support from the reopening of key global economies such as the United States, Europe and China.Dr Chua Hak Bin, economist at MayBank Kim Eng, warned that the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Asean could result in \"possible disruptions to Singapore's manufacturing and food supply chain\".Mr Song agreed, noting that disruptions to local food supply following the restrictions imposed at Jurong Fishery Port and across Singapore's wet markets could lead to temporary price pressures.He added the real estate sector may face a pullback as a result of the extended restrictions on F&B outlets that could lead to business closures.Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates in Asia, with 48 per cent of the population now fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Therefore, Mr Gan is maintaining his GDP growth outlook of 6.5 per cent for this year.A buying opportunity is presenting itself for equity investors. \"We don't think the heightened measures will dampen investor sentiment in the stock or property markets\", said Dr Chua.He said \"the far more severe lockdowns last year had only a short-lived negative impact on the stock and property markets\", adding that \"investors will be looking more closely at the vaccination rate and anticipating some relaxation when the rate reaches two-thirds on National Day on Aug 9 or 75 per cent by the fourth quarter\".Ms Kong Ling Wei, a senior director at Colliers, said that despite the phase two (heightened alert) restrictions from May 16 to June 13, total property investment sales surged 86.3 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first three months of the year as investors took a longer-term view of their real estate investments.DBS Vickers said there are opportunities for investors to buy stocks in sectors that could benefit from a domestic recovery, such as public transport, F&B and healthcare, as well as industrial, office and retail real estate investment trusts."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

At the same time, leasing activity has ceased at AXA Tower as it readies for redevelopment.JLL expects this to further tighten supply, reducing Grade A CBD office vacancies to 7 per cent or lower by the end of 2022, down from 8.6 per cent in Q4 2021.Against this backdrop, rental growth could more than double the pace in 2021 and \"intensify investors' interest in Singapore's office assets and drive capital value growth\", Ms Tay noted.Meanwhile, Cushman & Wakefield projects a 4.6 per cent increase in rents of CBD Grade A offices next year, with Singapore poised to outperform the broader Asia-Pacific market. In the city-state, the balance of power is \"shifting back towards landlords\", the firm said.This comes amid resurgent office demand, tight new supply and the reopening of the global economy, said Mr Wong Xian Yang, head of research for Singapore at Cushman & Wakefield.He also expects the amount of co-working space within the CBD Grade A office market to grow \"substantially\" in 2022 with the completion of asset enhancement works at 21 Collyer Quay, after having reached 1.7 million square feet (sq ft) or 5.5 per cent of total CBD Grade A office stock thus far.Mr Mark Lampard, executive director and head of Singapore commercial leasing at Cushman & Wakefield, noted that the country's thriving tech and finance ecosystem continues to have a healthy appetite for office spaceas the companies expand headcounts.JLL highlighted the uneven recovery of the Republic's office leasing market. Newer, greener and better-quality assets have been more sought-after and thus led in rental growth. As employees return to the office, demand for greener, more sustainable spaces and healthy working environments has been amplified and \"are now of paramount concern\", Ms Tay noted.She added that this has underpinned the robust take-up rates for newly completed projects, as well as the healthy absorption of space that was given up in good-quality developments by tenants following space-rationalisation exercises.For example, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp reportedly took up close to 70,000 sq ft of space at the newly completed CapitaSpring. At One Raffles Quay, L'Oreal moved into a 67,000 sqft office, which was released by UBS when the latter relocated to 9 Penang Road. CGS-CIMB Securities also recently relocated to about 38,000 sq ft at Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 2 that used to be occupied by Standard Chartered Bank.In 2021, leasing activity has strengthened since the first quarter of the year, thus fuelling rental increases. This came as the economic recovery and the roll-out of the country's Covid-19 vaccination programme stoked office occupiers' confidence, encouraging them to plan ahead for business growth as well as slowing business cessation and downsizing, Ms Tay said. Delays in project completions due to pandemic-related disruptions, coupled with stock withdrawal for redevelopment, kept supply tight.According to JLL, rents of CBD Grade A offices posted a full-year growth of 4.2 per cent for 2021, far exceeding the firm's forecast at the start of the year, of a 6 per cent decline.The CBD Grade A office monthly gross effective rent rose to an average of $10.23 per square foot (psf) as at Q4 2021, up from $10.05 psf in the previous quarter and $9.81 psf in the year-ago period. Rents had bottomed out in Q1 2021, before the quarter-on-quarter increases accelerated to a 1.8 per cent rise in Q4 2021, the fastest in 11 quarters, JLL noted.The recovery of office rents from the pandemic's impact spurred a flurry of activity in the capital market. Sales of assets with predominantly office use, worth $5 million and above, totalled $4.5 billion in the year to date, almost double the $2.3 billion accumulated in 2020, JLL said.The largest deal sealed in 2021 so far was the $1.28 billion sale of One George Street by CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust and FWD Group to a joint venture between JPMorgan Global Alternatives and Nuveen Real Estate. The transaction completed in Q4 2021. The price translates to about $2,875 psf based on the existing net lettable area of 445,745 sq ft."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It was later relaunched in July the same year with more redevelopment options: as a hotel, a commercial and residential development, or a fully commercial building, all with a 5.0 plot ratio, The Business Times reported then. That meant the 52,471 square feet (sq ft) site could be redeveloped up to a gross floor area (GFA) of about 262,354 sq ft.The Sultan Plaza plot could potentially yield a 700-key hotel, and the new project's height can go up to about 30 to 35 storeys, Lianhe Zaobao noted in its latest article.Nearby, Golden Mile Complex was put on the market on Nov 30, with a $800 million reserve price. That would be the second en bloc attempt for the mixed-use development, which was recently gazetted as a conserved building.Meanwhile, City Plaza along Geylang Road is gunning for another collective sale exercise, although it has yet to garner the 80 per cent mandate.Presently, more than 20 per cent of the unit owners have given their consent, Lianhe Zaobao reported. City Plaza held an extraordinary general meeting in November 2021 to kickstart the process, and will thus have a year to win the support of at least 80 per cent of the owners before the CSC can launch a tender.The 18-storey freehold development has a total of 531 units, including 465 strata retail units and 66 residences.City Plaza was completed in 1972 and is known for its wholesale shops, which mainly sell clothing. Its land area spans about 141,505 sq ft while the GFA is around 424,515 sq ft.During the 2017 collective-sale boom, City Plaza unit owners were eyeing a sale price of between $800 million and $1 billion. Shop owners then had cited falling rental rates, which were said to be slipping to levels of the 1990s, as well as rising maintenance costs for the ageing building.In 2019, some owners were targeting a $950 million asking price, but the property did not go to the market as the CSC failed to garner the requisite 80 per cent owners' consent, Lianhe Zaobao reported.City Plaza is zoned for commercial use with a gross plot ratio of 3.0, under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 2019. It is next to KINEX shopping mall and also near Paya Lebar Quarter and SingPost Centre."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mike*, a business owner, will soon have to sign a new commercial property loan agreement for his factory building in the western part of Singapore.He plans to replace his current commercial property loan, which is pegged to the Singapore Dollar Swap Offer Rate (SOR), with a new floating-rate loan based on the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA).While some of his fellow business owners expressed concerns about taking a new property loan agreement on a borrowing rate they did not know much about, Mike regards SORA as a reliable interest rate benchmark. He understands how SORA is calculated, having renewed his company's credit line earlier this year to replace an older floating-rate agreement that was expiring. Mike is one of many commercial property owners who will be affected as Singapore transits to using SORA as the key interest rate benchmark. The transition impacts not just floating-rate loans and mortgages, but also any financial contract tied to SOR or the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR), including bonds and derivatives (such as currency and interest rate swaps). In the coming months, borrowers will need to switch out of their SOR-based loans. This is because SOR will be discontinued immediately after June 30, 2023, when the US dollar (USD) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) - a key component used in the calculation of SOR - is no longer available.Borrowers with SIBOR-based loans will also need to switch out in due course as the widely used one-month and three-month SIBOR will no longer be published after December 31, 2024. Since May 1, 2021, banks in Singapore have stopped referencing SOR in new loans and securities maturing after end 2021. Banks have also stopped issuing new SIBOR-based loans from October 1, 2021.As SOR will be discontinued at an earlier date, banks are working to transition customers with existing SOR-based loans first. The approach for converting SIBOR-based loans is in the works, and further details will be made public in due course.The switch to SORA is in line with global reforms to improve the robustness and integrity of financial benchmarks. Mrs Ong-Ang Ai Boon, director of The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), says that banks in Singapore have been preparing over the past two years to ensure a smooth transition to SORA for all customers. \"There has been a strong increase in the take-up rate of SORA financial products across wholesale and retail markets in recent months, reflecting customers' increased confidence in using SORA. We expect this trend to further accelerate in the coming quarter after banks stop offering new SIBOR loans, and stop using SOR in new derivatives from October 1, 2021.\"When Mike switches from his existing SOR-based commercial property loan to one pegged to SORA, an adjustment spread will need to be added to his loan package to reflect the difference between SOR and SORA. This adjustment spread is necessary as SOR factors in term and credit risks while SORA does not. Note: The all-in rate for SORA-based loans may differ slightly from that of SOR-based loans after conversion, depending on movement of compounded SORA.Historically, the three-month Compounded SORA tends to be lower than the three-month SOR (see chart below). Data from the past five years showed that the three-month Compounded SORA, which is commonly used in mortgage loans, has been on average about 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage points, lower than the three-month SOR. Three-month SOR vs three-month Compounded SORA: A historical comparisonTherefore, there is a need to apply an adjustment spread to account for term and credit risks. Mike should work closely with the bank to understand how the adjustment spread is determined. Commercial borrowers with existing SOR-based property loans can either switch their mortgages to reference SORA, or take up other loan packages currently offered by their bank, including fixed-rate loans or loans pegged to other reference points such as fixed deposit rates or board rates.Singapore banks are aiming to convert all corporate SOR exposures by December 31, 2022, so as to avoid any potential disruptions for affected borrowers once SOR ceases. While 2023 may seem a long way off, borrowers are strongly encouraged to contact their banks early to understand their options for switching to alternative loan packages. Says Mrs Ong-Ang: \"Given that the transition is inevitable, we encourage borrowers to explore their options early and contact their banks sooner rather than later. This will allow borrowers to make an informed decision for a smooth transition.\"Click here to learn more about SORA and get the latest updates on Singapore's interest rate benchmarks. SORA will replace SOR and SIBOR in due course (see detailed timeline below). This industry-wide transition impacts not just retail loans and mortgages, but also commercial loans, corporate bonds and derivatives, among many other financial products.SORA is a transparent, robust and reliable interest rate benchmark that is fully backed by overnight transactions between banks. Banks typically offer SORA loan packages using compounded SORA rates. Interest payments based on compounded SORA rates tend to be less volatile, because these rates are averaged out over a period of time. This enables borrowers to benefit from more predictable loan servicing costs from month to month.Apart from converting to a SORA-based loan, commercial borrowers with existing SOR-based loans can also choose to take up other loan packages currently offered by their bank, including fixed-rate loans or loans pegged to other reference points such as fixed deposit rates or board rates.Apr 30, 2021: Banks ceased usage of SOR in new loans and securities.Sept 30, 2021: Banks ceased usage of SIBOR in new contracts and SOR in new derivatives (with exceptions).Oct 31, 2022: Banks to convert all SOR-based property loans to alternative packages.Dec 31, 2022: All other SOR contracts to be converted to SORA, or to include robust contractual fallbacks.June 30, 2023: Discontinuation of SOR.Dec 31, 2024: Discontinuation of SIBOR.Term risk: The additional payment to compensate for uncertainty over how interest rates may move over a future period of time.Credit risk: The additional payment to compensate for default risk faced by the bank.Loan margin: A fixed rate predetermined by the lender and added to the interest rate benchmark to compute the all-in interest rate charged on the loan.1https://abs.org.sg/docs/library/sc-sts-recommendations-for-transition-of-legacy-sor-contracts.pdf*Mike is a persona drawn up based on common concerns of business owners.Source: ABSThis is the third of a four-part series on the banking industry's transition to SORA, the new interest rate benchmark in Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

That means a PropNex agent needs to pay only $70 of the $117 annual membership fee. The agents will also receive training credits of up to $500 and benefit from free group insurance coverage of up to $40,000.NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng, who was guest of honour at the Facebook live broadcast of the MOU signing ceremony, applauded PropNex for taking the initiative to champion the cause of its self-employed agents.\"This is important in Singapore as we have about 200,000 self-employed persons and we think that this will continue to grow, given the new economy and new digital possibilities that are going to define the future economy,\" said Mr Ng.NTUC started looking into the welfare of self-employed some six to seven years ago and set up NTUC U FSE unit to provide support for freelancers and the self-employed, who are not protected under the Employment Act.Property agents have complained about unfair practices, such as fines for leaving their agencies that could amount to over $4,000, to the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA). The agents felt that the penalties were too harsh even though they were aware there would be clawbacks under agreements they had signed upon joining.Responding to ST's queries last month, CEA said it is not empowered under the Estate Agents Act to intervene in contractual matters between agents and agencies, and encouraged all agents \"to work with their current agencies to resolve any outstanding issues before submitting their applications to switch agencies\".Mr Adam Wang, president of Singapore Estate Agents Association (SEAA), said SEAA was set up to advocate the interest of real estate agencies and salespersons, but it is not in a position to help them mediate contractual issues. The property agents had told ST that they felt helpless as they were self-employed and had no platform to raise issues or air grievances.Acknowledging the vital role property agents play in the real estate sector, Mr Ismail Gafoor, chief executive of PropNex Realty, said it is unfortunate that real estate salespersons, who are considered self-employed, are not protected by any organisation or association, and \"often their plight or interests are not heard\".\"Being the market leader and in reaching the 10,000-salespersons mark, (PropNex believes) it is timely now for this partnership with Siseu so as to strengthen PropNex's offering as a fair and progressive real estate agency as we adopt fair recruitment and best practices within the industry when contracting with salespersons and establishing a dispute resolution mechanism for salespersons,\" he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

A reading below the 50 mark reflects contraction.The electronics sector's PMI came in at 51.2, rising for a 14th straight month.The overall manufacturing PMI performance was attributed to slower expansion rates in key sub-indexes for new orders, new exports, factory output, inventory and employment.However, the indexes for finished goods, input prices and supplier deliveries expanded at a faster rate and the employment index expanded for a seventh month in a row.\"Supply chain disruptions are still plaguing local manufacturers as they struggle to cope with reduced margins from the higher cost pressures,\" said Ms Sophia Poh, SIPMM's vice-president for industry engagement and development.This was reflected in the input prices index came at 51.7 - the highest recorded since December 2017 when the index was 51.8.The electronics sector's stronger reading was attributed to faster growth recorded in new orders, new exports and factory output.However, the indexes for both inventory and employment expanded at a slower rate, whereas the indexes for imports, input prices, and order backlog expanded at a faster pace.Meanwhile, the supplier deliveries index reverted to contraction after having recorded eight months of continuous expansion.The finished goods index also expanded at a slower pace, which could be a harbinger that momentum could have peaked and an imminent slowdown is on the cards.Ms Selena Ling, OCBC Bank's chief economist and head of treasury research and strategy, said that as inventory levels edge lower for both the domestic manufacturing and electronics sectors, the ability to sustain production in the run-up to the Christmas season's demand spike may be at stake.She said that going forward, companies' ability to pass on some of the higher costs to end-consumers would also be key to maintaining their growth momentum.\"Fears of supply chain disruptions and component shortages interrupting the manufacturing momentum within Asia appear to pose potential headwinds ahead for regional manufacturing centres including Singapore,\" she said.Manufacturers worldwide, including Singapore's Creative Technology, have been struggling with challenging market conditions since late last year. These were due to supply chain disruptions caused by the global shortages of semiconductors, delays in shipping schedules due to port congestion and a shortage of containers, and skyrocketing freight costs.Creative, which once used to compete with Apple Inc for portable media players, said in a regulatory filing in August this year that it expects an operating loss in the financial year the will end in June 30, 2022.This comes as the company grapples with product shortages due to component unavailability and spiking prices, as well as frequent shipping disruptions.The supply chain disruptions have further worsened in recent weeks due to ongoing power shortages in China and Covid-related restrictions due to the Delta resurgence across the Asean region.Analysts said that Chinese policymakers are taking counter measures to address the power shortages, while wider vaccination coverage in Asean which could result in relaxation of restrictions and higher industrial activity. However, near-term supply challenges may persist.Still, Singapore's manufacturing sector has so far remained relatively more stable, with industrial production expanding at 11.2 per cent year-on-year in August, translating into a robust 14.3 per cent year-to-date growth. Electronics and precision engineering clusters have been the star performers on the back of strong global demand for electronic products. In August, electronics manufacturing increased 15.4 per cent and precision engineering by 22.9 per cent compared to a year ago.UOB Group economist Barnabas Gan said Singapore's decline in overall manufacturing PMI is likely due to a slightly softer external environment, as seen from the slower expansion rates in new orders, new exports and factory output.He said the retreat in momentum was evident in Singapore's disappointing August non-oil domestic exports, which expanded at an annual pace of 2.7 per cent - the slowest since November 2020."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

As a major maritime port, Tanjong Pagar played a significant role in Singapore's history - and after further modernisation, it has become the heart of the Republic's vibrant commercial centre.But that's far from the end of Tanjong Pagar's growth story. Strategic redevelopment plans by the Government firmly prioritise the neighbourhood surrounding One Bernam for continued renewal in the years ahead.One Bernam sits right at the doorstep of the Greater Southern Waterfront, an upcoming precinct overlooking Singapore's southern seas that will be developed with some 9,000 new homes, a waterfront promenade and other attractions. (Click here for virtual access to the panoramic views.)Stretching some 30km between Pasir Panjang and Marina East, the waterfront neighbourhood will be developed progressively, starting from the next five to ten years.The Anson neighbourhood, right next to Tanjong Pagar, has also been earmarked by the Urban Redevelopment Authority as a new, community-focused neighbourhood filled with \"attractive streets and cosy squares\", serving as the downtown area's gateway to the verdant Rail Corridor. Even today, the Tanjong Pagar district is already commencing the early stages of its facelift, with several buildings undergoing redevelopment.With the CBD Incentive Scheme, which was rolled out in 2019, several downtown building owners have heeded the Government's encouragement to redevelop their older office buildings as mixed-use developments - adding a big dose of vibrancy and reimagining downtown Singapore as the place to live, work and play.All these not only place One Bernam on a trajectory for continued asset appreciation, but also mean that a savvy investor buying into the development today is locking in tomorrow's growth at today's prices.One Bernam's strategic location at the nexus of tradition and modernity looks poised to offer an exciting lifestyle experience.Nestled among office skyscrapers and the nearby historic Chinatown, the development is surrounded by a wide range of amenities to suit every resident.For your meals, there's everything from traditional hawker fare at Tanjong Pagar Food Centre to Michelin-starred restaurants in gazetted shophouses.

Another 40 2-room rental flats will be integrated in one of the blocks.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.The project sits on 2 plots of land along Weld Road and Kelantan Road and is directly connected to Jalan Besar MRT station.Prices start from S$409,000, without grants, for a 3-room flat and S$582,000 for a 4-room flat, making them the most expensive units in a mature estate in this launch.The prices are slightly higher than those in August's Queenstown BTO project, Queen's Arc, where a 3-room flat started from S$382,000 and a 4-room flat began from S$540,000.Under the PLH model, owners of these Rochor flats will pay 6 per cent of the resale price or valuation, whichever is higher, to HDB when they resell their home on the open market for the first time.The subsidy clawback only applies to the first resale transaction and does not apply to subsequent resales.This is because HDB has to provide additional subsidies on top of those provided for all BTO flats in order to launch these prime areas flats at affordable prices.All subsidies are factored into flat prices when they are launched as BTO flats.In order to prevent excessive windfall gains when owners sell their flats on the open market, HDB said it will claw back the additional subsidies.This also means that owners who choose to not sell their flats will not get their subsidies clawed back.Owners will also be subject to a 10-year minimum occupation period (MOP), up from the current 5 years, before they can sell it on the open market.This comes on top of the 71 months - just under 6 years - waiting time for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2028.Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the waiting time for a standard BTO flat was about 3-4 years.This means owners will likely only be able to resell these flats sometime in 2038.The pool of resale buyers of these Rochor flats will also be limited to households who earn not more than S$14,000 a month, with at least one applicant a Singapore citizen.The PLH model - to ensure that new public housing in prime, central locations will remain affordable, accessible and inclusive for Singaporeans - comes after almost a year of public consultations.At least one prime location housing project will be launched each year, although proportion of flats will differ year on year to ensure a diverse supply across estates.Seniors can have their pick in this sales exercise, with 68 2-room flexi flats on offer in a second \"vertical kampung\" in the non-mature estate of Choa Chu Kang.The Heart of Yew Tee is an integrated development and houses Chua Chu Kang's first hawker centre, a polyclinic, a community club, a kidney dialysis centre, a community plaza and retail shops.Flats will come with elderly-friendly fittings and smart distribution boards.Prices start from S$72,000 and only seniors aged 55 and above can apply for these flats.The project sits adjacent to YewTee Point shopping mall, which has a sheltered linkway to Yew Tee MRT Station.The estimated completion date is in the first quarter of 2026, so buyers have to wait about 4 years for their homes.It is Singapore's third integrated development with housing for seniors, after Kampung Admiralty in Woodlands and the community care apartments, a type of assisted living public housing, in Harmony Village @ Bukit Batok.In the current November launch, the only other BTO project in a mature estate is Kent Heights in Kallang/Whampoa.A total of 430 2-room flexi and 4-room flats are on offer, on a site along Owen Road, next to the Central Expressway (CTE).Prices start from S$192,000 for a 2-room flexi flat and S$511,000 for a 4-room flat.The estimated completion date is in the fourth quarter of 2026, which means buyers will have to wait more than 4 years for them to be ready.There are 2 BTO projects in the non-mature estate of Hougang.The bigger project is Hougang Olive, where 390 4-room and 5-room flats are on offer on a site by Hougang Avenue 3, Hougang Street 12 and Hougang Street 13.Prices start from S$308,000 for a 4-room flat and S$416,000 for a 5-room unit.The waiting time is just under 3 years, as these flats are slated for completion in the first quarter of 2025, making these one of the fastest projects to be ready in this launch.The smaller project, which sits on an adjacent site, is Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang, where 300 4-room and 5-room units are on offer.Prices start from S$318,000 for a 4-room flat and S$419,000 for a 5-room unit.These flats are estimated to be ready in just under 4 years, in the second quarter of 2026.In the non-mature estate of Jurong West, 221 3-room and 4-room flats are on offer at Nanyang Opal, on a site bounded by Jurong West Street 92 and 93.Prices start from S$173,000 for a 3-room flat and S$264,000 for a 4-room flat, making them the most affordable in this sales exercise.These flats are estimated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025, so buyers have to wait around 3.5 years for them.Tengah, Singapore's newest town, has 2 BTO projects in the Park district.The bigger project is Parc Clover @ Tengah, where 1,124 2-room flexi, 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats are on offer.Prices start from S$119,000 for a 2-room flexi, S$312,000 for a 4-room and S$428,000 for a 5-room flat.The smaller project is Parc Glen @ Tengah, where 2-room flexi, 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats are on offer.Prices start from S$120,000 for a 2-room flexi, S$319,000 for a 4-room and S$436,000 for a 5-room flat.Flats in both Tengah projects are slated for completion in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a waiting time of around 2.5 years, making them among the fastest to be completed in this launch.The 1,798 units offered under the SBF scheme are spread across mature and non-mature estates such as Bishan, Bukit Merah, Clementi, Queenstown and Punggol.About 31 per cent of them are already completed, while the rest are in various stages of construction.These flats are expected to be popular among buyers as the completion date of BTO projects have been stretched longer due to the manpower shortage and supply disruption in the construction industry arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.Applications for the flats close next Tuesday (Nov 23) at 11.59 pm on the HDB flat portal. The flats will be allocated through balloting.Next February, about 3,900 flats will be offered in towns such as Geylang, Kallang/Whampoa, Tengah and Yishun.Another 5,200 to 5,700 flats will be offered in towns such as Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Queenstown, Tampines, Toa Payoh and Yishun in May next year.The exact location of these projects and the number of flats at each site will be released only 3 months ahead of the launch.THE STRAITS TIMES"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The acquisition is from an unrelated third party vendor at an agreed property value of $416.3 million. The remaining 3 per cent effective interest in the property will be held by Mapletree Investments Japan Kabushiki Kaisha, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of MLT.The 13 new assets in China will be acquired for 1.15 billion yuan (S$246 million) in cash, while the remaining amount will be inter-company loans worth 1.77 billion yuan that MLT will pay through cash and new units, as well as 1.24 billion yuan in bank loans. For Vietnam's properties, U$14.4 million will be satisfied in cash, while the rest will be an undertaking of inter-company loans. Whereas for the new Japanese property, which comes at a discount of about 1.7 per cent to the independent valuation, will be paid for fully in cash. The trust on Nov 23 proposed an equity fundraising of new units in MLT to raise gross proceeds of about $700 million. Some $675.5 million of the amount will be used to fund the acquisitions, while $24.5 million will be used to pay for fees and expenses in connection with the acquisitions and equity fundraising. The fundraising includes a private placement of between 209.3 million and 215.1 million new units at an issue price of between $1.86 and $1.911 per new unit, to raise gross proceeds of approximately $400 million. This represents a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) discount of 1.2 per cent and 3.8 per cent to the adjusted VWAP of $1.9339 per unit respectively.A non-renounceable preferential offering of up to 163.4 new units to existing eligible unitholders at an issue price of between $1.82 and $1.87 per new unit is also proposed to raise gross proceeds of about $300 million. This represents a 1.9 per cent and a 4.5 per cent discount respectively to the VWAP of $1.9485 per unit of all trades on the Singapore Exchange for the preceding market day on Nov 22. DBS, HSBC Singapore and OCBC have been appointed as the joint global coordinators and bookrunners for the fundraising. The China acquisitions will deepen MLT's presence in the region which will now see 43 assets in 29 cities. The scarcity of grade-A warehouses in the China market as well as the location of the properties in close proximity to large population catchments bring key benefits to unitholders, the manager noted.\"The enlarged portfolio allows MLT to offer tenants a multi-city network of warehouse facilities, positioning MLT to be the preferred partner for fast-growing tenants looking to build presence across the country,\" the manager said.Vietnam is also a beneficiary of the structural trend of supply chain diversification, with competitive costs and an attractive investment environment.The manager added: \"With rising consumption, an expanding middle-income urban population and strong e-commerce adoption rate, demand for quality logistics space is expected to remain robust, while supply of Grade-A logistics space remains limited.\"Meanwhile, the Japan Property to be acquired is a freehold, 5-storey dry logistics facility with a gross floor area of over 1.7 million square feet. It is located within an established industrial and logistics cluster in Greater Nagoya, and is in close proximity to Nagoya City, Nagoya Port and Centrair Airport, as well as the ShinMeishin Expressway.Chief executive officer of the manager, Ng Kiat said that the acquisitions in China and Vietnam will expand MLT's network connectivity in those large growing consumer markets while the acquisition in Japan will scale up MLT's presence in Greater Nagoya, an attractive logistics market strategically located between Greater Tokyo and Greater Osaka.\"The pandemic has highlighted the importance of logistics and placed a greater emphasis on supply chain resiliency, fuelling demand for modern logistics space,\" she added.The trust requested for a trading halt on Tuesday (Nov 23) morning.

They were in areas including Mohammed Sultan Road, Scotts Road, Mountbatten Road and Aljunied Road/Geylang East Avenue 1.Mr Wong noted that commercial sites with at least a 30-year-lease may be attractive to developers, as they have the flexibility to divest the property with more than 20 years of lease remaining.The depreciation on land values accelerates as the lease runs down. Given their shorter tenure, land pricing would be lower and yields would be higher. This could appeal to yield-hungry investors, Mr Wong said.Sites with less than 30 years of lease may also be attractive to anchor tenants that may want to lease the whole space, he added, noting that such firms may have limited options in the market given rising Grade A office rents and tight vacancy rate in the CBD.Building a built-to-suit development on a short lease commercial site could be a cheaper option over time, he said.But he does not expect these sites to have an immediate impact on office rents in the near term.Factoring in the sale process and construction period, future developments may only be completed after 2026, he said.Moreover, the number of sites released in the CBD will likely be limited as the Government is moving towards decentralising commercial activities away from the city centre, and providing workspaces closer to homes, he noted.New sites would also be released gradually to avoid a future supply glut. As such, the overall impact on CBD Grade A rents may be limited, he said.More attractive and flexible workspaces to support innovation and the needs of businesses and workers are also being planned in the city centre and regional centres.To save on land, the URA said it is exploring in industrial estates a \"vertical zoning\" concept that integrates different but complementary uses within a single development. For instance, clean industrial activities can occupy the lower floors, while co-working spaces take up the mid-floors, which then creates a buffer for residences on the upper floors.Some industrial spaces may housea greater proportion of non-industrial uses, such as co-working, retail and food and beverage spaces, said URA. These spaces may be located in areas near transport nodes and distributed across estates islandwide, while hotel and residential uses could also be considered.To support more vibrant industrial developments, the URA is looking at potential sites for business-white zones - such as the Kolam Ayer and Yishun industrial estates - to accommodate non-industrial uses.Other potential business-white zones include one-north, the Pasir Panjang Power Station, Tai Seng, Jurong Lake District and Changi Business Park, where industries, such as biomedical, tech, electronics, are concentrated, Mr Wong noted.Business-white sites are industrial sites that allow a greater flexibility of use. This means that they can potentially include more office or retail units, compared with existing B1 sites, which are for light clean industries only; and B2 sites, which allow only light, clean and general industries.Apart from rejuvenating the city centre by injecting mixed-used developments and more recreation options, the URA also plans to do the same for regional centres as the nature of work changes.While some companies may want to locate their headquarters in the city centre, they could increasingly be supported by workspaces in the regional centres, where workers work closer to their homes, it said.For example, Jurong Lake District is envisioned to be the largest business district outside the city centre, and its proximity to Tues Port as well as manufacturing and research nodes in the west region allows offices to be conveniently located closer to other operations.The URA is also studying ways to use technology to improve industrial processes and better manage disamenities.If industries such as cloud kitchens or logistics distribution centres can become cleaner and be located closer to homes, this will in turn reduce commuting time and improve residents' access to services, it said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Its first en bloc attempt in 2019 was at $380 million.Marketing agent Teakhwa Real Estate is optimistic: With very strong sales achieved at recent new project launches, we are seeing keener developer interest to replenish land banks.Located at 100 Jalan Sultan, the 52,471 square foot commercial-zoned site comprises 211 commercial units and 33 offices, totalling 244 strata lots.If the en bloc sale is successful, shop owners will each stand to get between $162,900 and $46.3 million, while owners of offices will receive between $619,800 and $2.05 million, Mr Sieow Teak Hwa, managing director of Teakhwa Real Estate told The Straits Times.In-principle approval has been given by the Singapore Land Authority for a potential sale of remnant state land of about 10,968 sq ft adjoining the Sultan Plaza site.With the potential purchase, the plot can be expanded to about 63,439.8 sq ft and redeveloped to a gross floor area (GFA) of 317,198.9 sq ft.The Sultan Plaza site can be redeveloped for mixed use, with up to 40 per cent floor area for commercial use and the remaining 60 per cent for residential units, according to a URA outline planning permission advisory.As a mixed-use project, the price will work out to a land rate of $1,548.7 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) including estimated costs to buy the state land, a 7 per cent bonus balcony gross floor area, differential premium and lease top up premium, Mr Sieow said.Alternatively, the site can be redeveloped into a 700-key hotel with ancillary shopping and commercial space.For a new hotel with 20 per cent commercial floor area, the land rate will work out to $1,629.4 psf ppr, including estimated costs to buy the state land, differential premium and lease top up premium, Mr Sieow said.There is no additional buyers stamp duty payable for the commercial site, whose tender will close on June 28 at 3 pm.Located near the Nicoll Highway and Lavender MRT stations, the site is also close to Marina Bay, Bugis Junction, Raffles Hotel, the F1 race circuit and Kampong Glam district.To date this year there have been three commercial en bloc deals totalling $1.62 billion in value compared with just one for the same period last year - that of Maxwell House, which sold for $276.8 million. For the whole of 2021, commercial en bloc deal value totalled $926.8 million.The latest property cooling measures could also have shifted some investor demand to the commercial property market, Mr Wong Xian Yang, head of research at Cushman & Wakefield said.Helping boost total commercial en bloc deal value this year were the mega sales of Golden Mile Complex and Tanglin Shopping Centre, for $700 million and $868 million respectively.These transactions helped boost market sentiment and we anticipate more projects to launch amid a tight commercial and residential market, Mr Wong said.Developers and investors remain confident in the mid- to long-term prospects of the Singapore property market due to the countrys stable economic outlook and a limited supply of prime commercial space, Mr Wong said.This is reflected in the recovery of the commercial rental market.Mr Wong noted that office rents in the central region rose 1.6 per cent in the first quarter this year from the previous three months, the second consecutive quarter of growth.While central region retail rents fell by 0.4 per cent in Q1 2022, we anticipate retail rents to bottom out and return to growth this year, given the re-opening of borders and relaxation of safe distancing measures, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

S-Reits also give retail investors opportunities to invest in commercial real estate, such as Vivo City, Suntec City, Raffles City, etc, which will otherwise not be possible with the limited capital.As local sponsors gained confidence from the early S-Reit listings, they set up new Reit vehicles that hold overseas real estate. These Reits listed before the global financial crisis in 2007 are broadly divided into 2 groups.The first group holding geographically diversified real estate in the logistics, warehouse, and hospitality sectors includes Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust (previously known as Frasers Logistics & Industrial Trust) and Ascott Residence Trust. Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.The second group holding sector-focused real estate outside Singapore includes CapitaLand China Trust (previously known as CapitaLand Retail China Trust), Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust, Ascendas India Trust, and First Reit.As the S-Reit market grows and gains reputation, more foreign Reits package overseas real estate portfolios and list them on Singapores bourse. IReit Global was the first pan-European real estate portfolio REIT listed on Singapores bourse in August 2014. City Developments acquired half of the stake in IReits asset manager from Tikehau Capital, a French alternative asset management group, in 2019.China sponsors followed the bandwagon with the listings of 4 China-focused Reits on Singapores bourse, including BHG Retail Reit in 2015, followed by EC World REIT in 2016, Dasin Retail Trust in 2017, and Sasseur Reit in 2018. In recent years, Reits with real estate assets located farther away in the European and US markets emerged to tap capital via listings on Singapores bourse.The small size of the local real estate market pushed more local Reits to pursue growth through acquisitions of properties outside Singapore. More S-Reits looked abroad for promising investments. Foreign real estate acquisitions hit a record high of S$11.8 billion, accounting for about 91 per cent of the total assets acquired in 2021.Today, only 3 of 43 Singapore-listed Reits (that is, Far East Hospitality Trust, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, and Sabana Industrial Trust) hold 100 per cent of Singapore real estate in their portfolios.The market seems to have significantly under-valued overseas real estate relative to those in Singapore. The charts show that Reits holding overseas real estate were priced at significant discounts to book values, despite offering high dividend yields. The market price to book value ratio and the dividend yield of the overseas-centric Reits average at 0.766 times and 7.08 per cent as of May 20, 2022, compared to 1.054 times and 4.59 per cent, respectively, for Reits with some exposure to local real estate markets.The undervaluation of overseas-centric Reits could be explained from the perspectives of diversification strategies, local bias in stock valuation, and control spans of Reit managers.Geographical diversificationGeographically diversified real estate is not always effective in reducing systematic risks, especially in markets where real estate prices are highly correlated. Some Reits choose strategies to avoid value dilution by adding real estate of the same type from other countries. Commercial and retail Reits with a high concentration of real estate in Singapore include Mapletree Commercial Trust, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, OUE Commercial Trust, and CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust.These Singapore-focused Reits appeal to institutional investors who already hold diversified real estate portfolios outside Singapore. In contrast, Reits with geographically diversified real estate may not fit into the diversification strategies of these investors. Diversification outside Singapore may not add value to some Reits.However, other Reits in the hospitality sector, such as Ascott Residence Trust and Frasers Hospitality Trust, and those in the logistics and warehouse business, such as Frasers Logistics & Commercial Trust, and Mapletree Logistics Trust, hold real estate in different markets for strategic reasons, not for diversification motives. Firms need to take up warehouse and logistics space across countries to support the supply chain operations of businesses. Diversifying real estate outside Singapore creates a competitive edge and adds value to these Reits portfolios.Local BiasDemand for physical real estate space is mainly derived from local economic activities. Shopping mall managers need to know not just purchasing power, but also the culture and taste of residents in local markets.Local bias of investors and analysts adversely distorts the valuation of foreign Reits. Investors, especially retail investors unfamiliar with overseas real estate, are more hesitant to invest in foreign Reits. Stock analysts are also more reluctant to cover foreign Reits, especially those owning real estate in far-away markets.Control spansReit managers could overstretch their resources and control spans when remotely managing real estate portfolios distributed across different regions. A local management team played an instrumental role in supporting local operations of foreign Reits, especially during the periods when the Covid-19 border controls were in place. For example, Cromwell European Reit establishes property management offices in 17 cities across 11 countries to build long-term relationships with tenants and identify new investment opportunities in foreign markets. Foreign Reits could trail local rivals in generating value for overseas real estate portfolios, which in turn causes the undervaluation of their foreign assets.Reits that outsource management and property services of foreign properties to third-party managers may not be able to compete effectively with their local rivals. It is also harder for Reits to scale up their operations and develop a competitive edge without the support of a local team.The high dividend yield and the underpricing of overseas real estate put a lid on the growth of foreign Reits. While foreign Reits find it a disincentive to inject new assets into their portfolios, local Reits could still leverage the yield gap between local and foreign real estate to expand overseas. However, they should not pursue overseas growth strategies at the expense of diluting the values of existing Reit unitholders. They must balance the growth against possible risks in holding foreign real estate in their portfolios.Professor Sing Tien Foo is director of the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies (IREUS), and head of the Department of Real Estate at the National University of Singapore.

As such, the property was subsequently withdrawn from the market,\" he said.The guide price of $18.9 million works out to $2,883 per sq ft on the total strata area. As this is a commercial property, foreigners are eligible to purchase it and there will be no additional buyer's stamp duty or seller's stamp duty payable.SDB purchased the parcel in Serangoon Road from the National Aerated Water Company for $47 million in December 2016.A year later, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) announced that the main building that had housed the factory would be partially conserved to preserve part of Kallang's industrial history.Built in 1954, the factory used to bottle soft drinkssuch as Sinalco and Kickapoo Joy Juice. After its sale to SDB, it was refurbished and integrated with SDB's 117-unit freehold Jui Residences, which has been fully sold.Located near the Potong Pasir and Boon Keng MRT stations, the property comprises three units under a single strata-titlewith a total strata area of about 6,555 sq ft.It is approved for restaurant use on the ground floor, while the second-floor unit has been tenanted to a student care operator.Mr Lee noted that the URA'slatest restrictions on strata subdivision of commercial properties in key areas within the central area will likely limit the supply of new strata commercial assets.But CBRE expects this to have a positive impact on prices for existing commercial strata properties, he said.Meanwhile, an industrial building in the Leng Kee Road car showroom belt has been put up for sale via an expression of interest exercise at $19 million, marketing agent JLL said.Located in Kung Chong Road, the light industrial-cum-office building with a car service workshop on the ground floor sits on a total site area of about 15,996 sq ft. Approved for light and clean industrial use, the property has a gross area of about 15,642 sq ft, with the potential to increase to about 40,000 sq ft with a plot ratio of 2.5.The 99-year leasehold JTC land has a remaining lease of about 33 years.

The site, located near Lorong Chuan MRT, can be redeveloped into 900 units.Chuan Park had failed in its 2018 sale bid with a guide price of $900 million, and subsequently lowered the price to $820 million.According to Cushman & Wakefield, five residential developments were sold en bloc for $447.7 million in the first six months this year, compared with four deals totalling just $93 million in the same period last year.For the whole of 2021, eight residential collective sale deals totalling $1.17 billion were done.Mr Wong Xian Yang, head of research at Cushman & Wakefield, cited the $273.89 million sale of Lakeside Apartments for the increase in residential collective sale deal value so far this year.He said that the robust response to new private home launches in the face of declining unsold inventory and continued growth in home prices could drive more developers to landbank via the en bloc market.In May, new home sales reached 1,356 units, double that of April. More projects are expected to launch for collective sale to ride on current sentiment, he added.Meanwhile, 160-unit Park View Mansions in Yuan Ching Road is trying its luck for a second time at a collective sale at a guide price of $260 million. The tender will close on July 27 at 2pm.Owners stand to get $1.5 million for the 1,119 sq ft units, $1.58 million for the 1,313 sq ft units and $1.6 million for the 1,335 sq ft units.The 99-year leaseholdcondos previous en bloc attempt at $320 million failed in 2018 without a sale.At $260 million, the land rate works out to $1,023 psf ppr, including the estimated differential premium and lease top-up to a fresh 99 years.Built in the 1970s, the development sits on a land area of 191,974 sq ft and is zoned for residential use with a gross plot ratio of 2.1. It can be redeveloped up to a GFA of 403,145 sq ft.The future development can be rebuilt into an upscale 20to 24-storey condominium project of over 440 units, assuming an average apartment size of 915 sq ft, said Mr Jeremy Rikas Chiu, group division director, ERA Realty.We expect a strong market demand for the new project at the Park View Mansions site, given its prime location which commands unblocked views of Jurong Lake Gardens, Lakeside Garden and Jurong Lake, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It comprises 209 apartments, 559 offices, 192 strata shops, a carpark and a pool.Edmund Tie did not disclose the amounts the owners stand to get.The property's commercial zoning also means that there is no additional buyer's stamp duty payable and no restriction on foreign ownership.In October last year,International Plaza's outline application for redevelopment into a 280m-high, 62-storey project with a 24.05 plot ratio under the Central Business District Incentive Scheme was rejected.In rejecting the proposal, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said that the property \"currently has a good mix of uses, ranging from residences to retail, food and beverage, and personal services, in addition to offices\".Furthermore, the building intensity of the existing development, at 19.24 gross plot ratio, is substantial and considerably higher than the surrounding developments in Tanjong Pagar, such as Guoco Tower, Twenty Anson and Springleaf Tower, according to URA.URA suggested alternative development options and issued planning guidelines.\"The project's residential quantum should at least match the existing residential quantum on site, at 30,361.52 sq m (excluding any bonus gross floor area). There will be no further increase in the office quantum, which will be capped at 87,861.96 sq m in the new project,\" URA said.The project's overall height control remains at 250m."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This means its psf price works out to be $9,361, compared to $6,411 for the Tampines coffee shop.The Yishun coffee shop's psf price eclipses the average of $6,964 psf for ground level retail units in Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza in Orchard Road sold this year, according to data from ERA Research and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).It has 78 years left on its lease, two years more than the Tampines coffee shop, which is located at Block 201 Tampines Street 21.Local media outlet 8world reported that the transactions for both coffee shops have yet to be completed. A caveat lodged with SLA secures a property for the buyer.According to the Singapore Business Directory, Y848 is registered at Chang Cheng HQ in Woodlands. Chang Cheng Group owns more than 160 food outlets in Singapore, with brands such as the Chang Cheng Mee Wah coffee shop chain, Chang Cheng Chinese Vegetables Rice and Rong Kee Roasted Delights.Mr Nicholas Mak, ERA Singapore's head of research and consultancy, told The Straits Times that he believes the two big-ticket sales come as a result of the broad easing of Covid-19 measures that investors wager will bring diners back to coffee shops in droves.\"The lifting of Covid-19 restrictions signals to the investors that things are going back to normal and the diners are coming back, so it gives them some confidence to enter the market,\" said Mr Mak.\"We could still see some more of such transactions this year, but rising interest rates might dampen such aggressive bids. As interest rates increase, the cost of financing these investments will increase.\"Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research at Huttons Asia, said coffee shops are a resilient asset class.After all, coffee shops serve heartlanders; people do need to eat and (coffee shops) offer affordable options compared to restaurants.While the supply of coffee shops is limited as HDB stopped selling them since 1998, he added that a company like Chang Cheng Group, with its food and beverage offerings, can own and operate a coffee shop, rather than just earning rent, which could explain the much higher price per square foot for the Yishun property.They could have businesses they could feature in the coffee shop to earn (revenue) at the same time... and this is very different from those buying just to earn from rent.Their considerations can be very different from people buying solely to own (the coffee shop).Stallholders at KPT Kopitiam saidon Friday (June 17) that they had been informed of the sale, and that the management would change in September.A woman who works at the beverage stall and wished to be known only as Madam Mok, 50, said workers were unsure if rents would increase.\"We've been serving customers here for over ten years. We don't know what will take place when they pass over to the new management, but we will keep working until then and see what happens,\" she added.Correction note:An earlier version of this story said that a caveat lodged with URA secures a property for the buyer. This is incorrect. Caveats for all property transactions arefiled with SLA. We are sorry for the error."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It is zoned commercial under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 2019 with a gross plot ratio of 8.6.The development, which is not earmarked for conservation, comprises a 13-storey and a 30-storey block, and has 324 shops, 256 offices, 120 apartments and a carpark.The collective sale has obtained 84 per cent of the owners' signatures by strata area and 80 per cent by share value, ERA said.Mr Koh Yam Khoon, chairman of the collective sale committee, said many owners were happy about the collective sale launch.Mr Sunny Wong, who leads the ERA team handling the collective sale of the development, said: \"The collective sale of People's Park Centre will provide a rare opportunity for developers to build an iconic building in the heart of a historical district in Singapore.\"He added that it is not often that a major development in the city area, next to an MRT interchange, comes onto the market.\"We believe that this collective sale will attract both major developers and real estate funds,\" he said.People's Park Centre is located near historical landmarks such as Upper Barracks and Chinatown Heritage Centre, malls such as OG Building and Chinatown Point, and schools including River Valley Primary School and Singapore Management University.The tender for the site will close at 3pm on Aug 18.This latest collective sale attempt comes after Golden Mile Complex was sold to a consortium for $700 million in May.The consortium comprising Perennial Holdings, Sino Land and Far East Organization had said it was the first collective sale of a large-scale strata-titled conserved building in Singapore.The iconic building, which was completed in 1973, was gazetted for conservation by the URA last year.The reserve price for Peoples Park Centre is the second highest for a collective sale launched since the Covid-19 pandemic, noted Huttons Asias senior director of research Lee Sze Teck.The highest was forInternational Plaza in Tanjong Pagar, which relaunched for sale in April with a reserve price of $2.7 billion, working out to a land rate of $2,448 psf ppr.For any site that costs more than $1 billion, the risk is much higher and developers will be more cautious, Mr Lee said, adding that he expects up to three consortiums to place bids.Ms Tang Wei Leng, Colliers managing director and head of capital markets and investment services, said the price is on the high side in the current market environment, given patchy global economic recovery, supply chain disruptions, inflation and higher interest rates.But she expects interest from consortiums of developers and financial partners.We think it could be too intense as a full commercial redevelopment and it is likely to do well with some residential or serviced apartment component, she added.Mr Lee said that its location on the fringe of the Central Business Districtcould be the main draw for buyers, but noted that the building needs maintenance due to its age.If it goes through, it may give the nearby Peoples Park Complex more confidence for collective sale, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

For instance, the 10 apartments can be converted into serviced residence or a co-living concept, subject to approval,\" he added.Meanwhile, the collective sale tender for Sultan Plaza, a 45-year-old commercial building, at a lower reserve price of $325 million, is expected to close on Oct 26, if the requisite 80 per cent mandate from owners for the lower price is obtained.The 52,471 sq ft commercial-zoned site comprises 211 commercial units and 33 offices, totalling 244 strata lots.\"We just need one to two more units to cross the 80 per cent threshold, which will happen very soon,\" Mr Sieow Teak Hwa, managing director of marketing agent Teakhwa Real Estate, said on Wednesday.Sultan Plaza relaunched in September at $325 million, after a previous tender at $360 million closed on June 28 with no buyers. Its first attempt to sell en bloc in 2019 was at $380 million.At $325 million, owners of the shops stand to get between $147,000 and $41.8 million, while the officeowners will get $560,000 to $1.85 million, Mr Sieow added.The proposed reserve price will translate into a land rate of $1,545.80 psf plot per ratio (ppr), including estimated costs to buy the state land, the differential premium and the lease top-up premium. It will average down to $1,504.30 psf ppr after factoring in an 8 per cent bonus gross floor area (GFA).The site can be redeveloped for mixed use, with the proposed commercial GFA to not exceed 40 per cent of total GFA.Serviced apartments can be considered for residential use.It can also be redeveloped into a 700-room hotel with shopping and commercial space.There is no additional buyer's stamp duty payable for the commercial site."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Based on Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority records, Mr Koh is listed as one of two directors.The purchase price for the 1,664 sq ft corner property in the Kampong Glam Conservation Area works out to $13,821 per sq ft(psf).ERA Realty's head of research and consultancy Nicholas Mak said it is the highest psf price for shophouses in the Kampong Glam area, which includes Arab Street and Bussorah Street, based on data from URA Realis.The three-storey shophouse, with a total built-up area of around 4,680 sq ft, is owned by a South Korean party that paid $18.8 million for it in 2019, the Business Times reported.BT reported that Mr Koh is in the early stage of buying the property. A caveat lodged with the Singapore Land Authority secures a property for the buyer.Mr Koh, also known as Xu Dalai, was formerly on the board of Chinese tech company Xiaomi Corporation.He stepped down from the post in 2019 to focus on Shunwei Capital.The transaction comes after a row of 11 shophouses in Lavender Street were sold for $71.28 million to Hafary Holdings in July.Ms Mary Sai, Knight Frank's executive director of capital markets, said there has been increased market activity since the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.\"Given that conserved shophouses in Singapore are limited in stock, the demand for this asset class is unlikely to fade any time soon,\" she said.\"As pre-pandemic normalcy returns with increased air travel, the shophouse market could potentially see another wave of demand stemming from investors who were previously restricted by travel measures and are interested in owning a shophouse in enclaves with ongoing gentrification,\" added Ms Sai.Mr Mak said there is healthy demand for shophouses from investors looking for retail space to own and rent out, because of the recovery in consumer spending.He expects rental demand for shophouses to continue to grow amid the recovery in tourism.\"Additionally, property cooling measures have turned some investors to the commercial market because of higher additional buyers' stamp duty in the residential market,\" he said.Ms Sai added that the shophouse market could record just under $2 billion in sales for the whole of 2022, given the sustained momentum in the first half of the year.The highest transaction in the first half of the year was $74.8 million for Hotel Clover, a row of 17 shophouses in Jalan Sultan, in March.The sales price translates to $4,921 psf for the 15,201 sq ft property.Meanwhile, a conservation shophouse at 21 New Bridge Road in Clarke Quay has been put up for sale by private treaty, said its marketing agent Sakal Real Estate Partners on Monday.The 99-year leasehold property, which has four storeys and a roof terrace, sits on a 1,443 sq ft site and was recently valued at about $22 million.On Aug 10, property agency Huttons Asia announced that a pair of adjoining freehold commercial shophouses in Jalan Besar have been put up for sale via an expression of interestwith a guide price of $17.5 million.Six adjoining freehold shophouses in Serangoon were also put up for sale with a $63 million guide price on Aug 2, PropNex Realty said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Controlled by one of Singapores most respected business families, the group has an unlikely portfolio of businesses that were formed over the past decade through a bold repositioning of its legacy assets and shrewd corporate deals.A confluence of factors including fast growth in its property investment business, the sale of its stake in Ara Asset Management to ESR Group, and surging profitability at its tin business have seen the group deliver blowout financial numbers recently.For 2021, Straits Trading saw its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rise nearly 200 per cent to S$401 million. Net profit climbed 355 per cent to S$234.3 million. The company attributed the sharp improvement mainly to its real estate-related businesses including fair value gains on its Australian and Korean logistics property portfolios.Straits Trading paid a dividend of 8 Singapore cents per share for 2021, up from 6 cents per share for each of the preceding 5 years.For H1 2022, Straits Trading reported a 290 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) rise in Ebitda to S$729.1 million. Net profit jumped 449 per cent y-o-y to S$673 million.Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.During the half-year period, Straits Trading booked a gain of S$658.1 million on the disposal of an associate. The company said the merger of Ara Asset Management and ESR Group was completed in January, and that it had recognised a value of almost S$1.1 billion in a combination of S$142.5 million in cash and 214.7 million ESR Group shares.On Aug 14, Straits Trading announced a special dividend by way of a distribution in specie. Entitled shareholders can elect to receive either 145 ESR Group shares or 180 Straits Trading shares for every 1,000 Straits Trading shares they own.It is quite possible, of course, that the groups earnings will fall back in the short term. And, although they were beaten down during the Covid-19 crisis, shares in Straits Trading have since bounced well above where they were before the pandemic started.At their closing price on Sep 9 of S$3.20, shares in Straits Trading have gained some 48 per cent over the past 3 years. The Straits Times Index is up only 2.5 per cent over the same period.Yet, shares in Straits Trading are still trading at a 39 per cent discount to their net asset value (NAV) as at Jun 30 of S$5.23 per share. Back in September 2019, the stock was trading at a 43 per cent discount to its then-NAV. On the face of it, shares in Straits Trading still seem reasonably priced despite their strong run. The big question is how the group plans to keep creating value for investors.Next month on Wednesday, Oct 5 readers of The Business Times will have the opportunity to join me as I talk to Eric Teng, one of Straits Tradings top officials, about the outlook for the company.One criticism of Straits Trading is that much of its recent success was not entirely of its own making.Its most significant move over the past decade was arguably the establishment of a strategic alliance in 2013 with Ara Asset Management and its founder John Lim. This involved buying a 20.1 per cent stake in Ara Asset Management for S$294.4 million, and forming an 89.5 per cent-owned co-investment vehicle known as Straits Real Estate (SRE) with Lim.The deal positioned Straits Trading to profit handsomely when Ara Asset Management was subsequently merged with ESR Group. Meanwhile, SRE has since become a major profit driver for Straits Trading. The group acquired Lims 10.5 per cent stake in SRE in 2021.It was also in 2013 that Straits Trading teamed up with Far East Orchard to create a stronger platform for itself in the hospitality space. Straits Trading holds a minority 30 per cent stake in the joint venture vehicle, Far East Hospitality Holdings.My own view is that there is nothing wrong with companies forging mutually beneficial partnerships in order to expand. More to the point, the deals Straits Trading has done over the past decade hewed to a strategic vision of monetising low-return assets and recycling its capital into scalable businesses which has been beneficial to investors.Straits Trading now appears to be entering a new phase, described in its latest annual report as being about converting assets into investment products and platforms for new growth engines. The group recently acquired a 14.3 per cent stake in SDAX Financial, an integrated digital investment and trading platform.Straits Trading has also been offering registered shareholders of its Shareholders Club the opportunity to invest in fractionalised properties through structured notes. Among the offerings so far are a Good Class Bungalow on Cable Road in Chatsworth Park and a residential property located at Woollerton Park in Gallop Green. The biggest risk for Straits Trading may be rising interest rates around the world which is bound to weigh on the valuations of real estate assets on its books, and hamper its ability to raise funds on attractive terms.Certainly, the group does appear to need cash for growth. In January, Straits Trading said it raised nearly S$80.9 million through a placement of 26 million shares at S$3.11 each. The proceeds were for potential acquisitions and business opportunities.Straits Trading said the placement would enhance its free float from 25.3 per cent to 29.8 per cent and address its low trading liquidity.When Tecity Group which is linked to the family of the late Tan Chin Tuan gained control of Straits Trading in 2008, it held almost 89 per cent of the companys shares. Straits Tradings latest annual report said Tecity held nearly 69.6 per cent of its shares as at Mar 9.Whatever the benefits of the placement to Straits Tradings free float, however, some investors may be uncomfortable that the company chose to place out shares at a more than 40 per cent discount to its book value.If you want to hear what Straits Tradings Eric Teng has to say about this or anything else related to the groups business and strategy, you can sign up for our event and send us your questions.Join Ben Pauls Mark to Market Live with Straits Tradings Eric Teng on Oct 5 from 12.30pm.

This phasewill comprise six stations serving Bukit Timah, Clementi, West Coast and the future Jurong Lake District.Affected land owners and lessees were informed of the acquisition on Tuesday, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in a statement that it and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) will help them with the process.Compensation for the land and space being acquired will be based on market value as at Tuesday, in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act.A valuation will be done to determine thecompensation amount.The underground space underneath the 322 sq m section of the carpark at Casa Esperanza will need to be handed over to LTA in early 2024, ahead of the construction of the CRL King Albert Park station, which will be located next to the condo.The decision on where to movethe 18 parking spaces to will be made at a later date.After construction is completed, the surface land will be returned to the condos management corporation strata title, and affected structures will be reinstated.LTA said the works near Casa Esperanza are expected to take about six years.Temporary facilities will be provided to maintain uninterrupted access to the condo, it added.The two units at Block L Pandan Loop Industrial Estate, which span 584 sq m, will need to be handed over by September 2024.This will facilitate construction of the planned CRL station in West Coast.Laws were amended in 2015 to allow the Government to acquire underground spaces for the development of public projects, without having to acquire the entire column of land above it.Underground spaces in Loyang Avenue were previously acquired for the construction of CRL phase one.Casa Esperanzas management declined to comment on the acquisition, when contacted on Tuesday.The Straits Times has also contacted JTC for comment.Comprising six stations, the 15km CRL phase two is slated to open by 2032, with construction expected to start in 2023.Once completed, it is expected to benefit 40,000 households within 800m of the six stations.Holland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Christopher de Souza, whose Ulu Pandan ward will be served by King Albert Park and Maju stations, said residents have asked for greater public transport connectivity, especially in Sunset Way and Clementi Crescent, where there are currently no MRT lines nearby.He is also glad that LTA has agreed to install lifts at an overhead bridge to provide barrier-free access between Sunset Way and Maju station.Asked about the acquisition of underground space at Casa Esperanza, which is in his ward, Mr de Souza said: The immense amenity of having an interchange right along the Bukit Timah belt, in my humble view, makes up for it.Noting the proximity of King Albert Park station to Methodist Girls School, he said the CRL will help to alleviate traffic congestion in the area if parents who drive their children to schoolopt for public transport instead.If one looks at this from a longer-term perspective, it is certainly to their advantage, he added.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

They therefore tend to pay higher amounts of cash-over-valuation (COV) when they buy resale flats, he said.COV refers to the difference between the sale price of a resale flat and its actual HDB valuation. The difference can only be paid for in cash by the buyer. From Friday, private home owners must wait 15 months after the sale of their current home before they can buy an HDB resale flat.Exceptions are made for those aged 55 and above who are moving from a private property to a four-room or smaller HDB resale flat, a two-room flexi flat or a community care apartment intended for seniors. Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.HDB will also, on a case-by-case basis, exempt those with genuine housing needs or those who face extenuating circumstances regardless of their age, said Lee.We intend for this (15-month wait-out) measure to be temporary. We will review this, depending on overall demand and market changes, said Lee. The latest round of cooling measures that kicked on Friday, just nine months after the last tranche of measures, aims to nip over-borrowing as both HDB resale and private home markets show growing signs of overheating. Noting that some have expressed concerns that the measures place a larger burden on first-time and lower-income families looking to buy a home, Lee said: This is not the case.This move is not expected to affect first-timer and lower income home buyers significantly as they may receive housing grants... and tap their CPF savings to pay for the flat purchase. Two big moves to tighten the maximum amount that can be taken for home loans kicked in on Friday.The first is raising the medium-term interest rate floor used to compute and assess borrowers abilities to repay, and therefore qualify for, a loan. The second is lowering the loan-to-value (LTV) limit, which means buyers can borrow less than before from HDB to finance their home purchase. Lee said these moves are to better protect home buyers by borrowing prudently and not overstretching themselves. This helps reduce the risk of them facing future difficulties in servicing their home loans amid the uncertain economic outlook and rising interest rate environment, he added. Mr Lee said the moves come at a time when market interest rates have risen significantly over the last year, compared with the years of exceptionally low interest rates from 2013 to 2021.This will help them avoid difficulties in servicing their long-term home loans, as we think mortgage interest rates are likely to rise further in future, along with US interest rates, said Mr Lee. Since the last round of cooling measures in December 2021, housing prices have continued to gain pace, causing some anxiety about affordability, especially among young families looking to buy their first home, said Mr Lee. Acknowledging that rising home prices have been a concern for Singaporeans, Lee said the latest measures, coupled with the ramp-up in new flat supply, will help to moderate prices and meet strong demand.We will continue to monitor the property market and ensure that they remain relevant and in line with economic fundamentals, he said.

It has been a good 48 years, but it is time for me to rest and enjoy my life,\" Mrs Lee told The Straits Times at her shoe shop, Darling Shoes, last week.\"It is also time that the centre gets a new lease of life and attracts even more people, especially since fewer people have been visiting since the (Covid-19) pandemic.\"People's Park Centre is up for collective sale by public tender with a reserve price of $1.8 billion, its marketing agency, ERA Realty Network, announced on July 6.An attempt to sell the centre en bloc for $1.35 billion in 2019 failed as only about 30 per cent of owners consented to the move, said owners who spoke to ST.To push through the collective sale of developments 10 years or older, consent of at least 80 per cent by share value and strata area from owners is needed.ERA said the collective sale this time garnered 84 per cent of the owners' signatures by strata area and 80 per cent by share value.Mrs Lee said she thought the previous reserve price was too low as she bought her shoe shop, which comprises two units totalling 804 sq ft, for $1.7 million.She declined to reveal how much she stands to receive if the development is sold, but added: \"If I get to retire, I'll pick up art and flower arrangement, and spend my time on things I like do to.\"Built in 1970, the commercial-cum-residential development sits on a 95,467 sq ft site, with a gross floor area of about 821,017 sq ft. It comprises a 13-storey block and a 30-storey block, and has 324 shops, 256 offices, 120 apartments and a carpark.According to ERA, owners of shops ranging from 4 sq m to 596 sq m could receive sale proceeds of between $213,000 and $22.7 million, while those with offices of 21 sq m to 510 sq m could receive between $536,000 and $12.5 million.Owners of apartments of 154 sq m to 224 sq m could receive between $2.39 million and $3.42 million, and with penthouses of 243 sq m to 392 sq m drawing between $3.42 million and $5.33 million.Mr Rudy Jung, 43, who has been living in a 154 sq m unit with his father since the 1980s, said he agreed to the collective sale as his home faces several problems due to its age.\"It's pretty rundown. There's water leakage and the water pipes get stuck. I hope the proceeds can cover some costs of our next home,\" the equipment engineer said, adding that he is looking to get a Housing Board flat.\"I hope the new developers maintain the structure of the building as it's difficult to see such structures these days,\" he added.The owner of Kao Pink Shoes, Madam Tan Sor Ching, 57, said she voted for a collective sale as she plans to retire after two turbulent years, when her family business was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.\"We've been through many ups and downs since the 1970s, but the worst hit was Covid-19. After restrictions eased in April, business has been back to pre-pandemic levels, but we have already set our minds on the attractive offer,\" she said.While most owners welcomed the latest collective sale attempt, others were apprehensive.Retired businessman Sin Piah Ho, 72, was among those who were against the sale as he is reluctant to move out of his apartment, which overlooks the Central Business District.\"If they tear it down, where am I going to go? I have lived here for over 30 years. It would be troublesome to move, and besides, I'm old and can't move around much,\" he said.Mr Sin added that he bought his 151 sq m home for about $120,000 and is worried that he would make a loss if the collective sale is successful.People's Park Centre is located near historical landmarks such as the police's Upper Barracks on Pearl's Hill and the Chinatown Heritage Centre, and shopping centres such as OG Building and Chinatown Point.Mr Wong Xian Yang, head of research at Cushman & Wakefield, said there could be interest from larger players or consortiums with strong development expertise for mixed-use projects, given the size of the site.\"There is opportunity to build an iconic integrated development offering a mix of uses in the heart of Chinatown. It could also spur gentrification efforts in the area,\" he said.But a drawback for developers would be the high capital requirement due to its asking price, Mr Wong added.Huttons Asia's senior director of research Lee Sze Tecksaid: \"For any site that costs more than $1 billion, the risk is much higher and developers will be more cautious.\"Mr Galven Tan, deputy managing director of investment sales and capital markets at Savills Singapore, said developers would likely tear down the building for redevelopment in the absence of conservation requirements.\"A complete redevelopment allows the developer full flexibility in planning and design,\" he added.If the deal is successful, property analysts said eyes are on the nearby People's Park Complex - another major development in the area with potential for a sale en bloc. It is about 300m from People's Park Centre.The centre's collective sale attempt comes after Golden Mile Complex was sold to a consortium for $700 million in May. The iconic building, which was completed in 1973, was gazetted for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority last year.Both People's Park Centre and People's Park Complex are currently not earmarked for conservation.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

The development, located in the Marina Bay area next to Downtown MRT station, is expected to be completed in October 2023.Tech companies continue to chip away at the dominance of banks in Singapore's Central Business District, with Amazon last year taking over three floors of office space from Citigroup at Asia Square Tower 1, where it is now the anchor tenant with 100,000 sq ft.The tech giant's latest reported move also adds to a trend of global firms bulking up their presence in Singapore to manage or expand their Asian operations, particularly as the appeal of Hong Kong diminishes.ByteDance, owner of TikTok, was in negotiations to lease some 120,000 sq ft to 130,000 sq ft of space at Capital Tower in Robinson Road, formerly occupied by JP Morgan, as the Chinese tech giant expands in Singapore, BT reported in April.ByteDance is reportedly already leasing about 130,000 sq ft at One Raffles Quays South Tower, some flexible space at its North Tower and 100,000 sq ft at Guoco Tower above Tanjong Pagar MRT station.As the maiden big-name anchor tenant at IOI Central Boulevard Towers, Amazon may be paying a gross effective monthly rental of around $10 per sq ft (psf), while Malaysia-listed developer IOI Properties Group is said to be targeting about $12 psf to $14 psffor the project, the report added, citing market speculation.Grade A office rents in the CBD may cross their pre-pandemic peak by the third quarter of this year, JLL Singapore said last month. The rents rose for the fifth straight quarter to $10.74 psf per month in the April to June quarter, just 0.6 per cent shy of the pre-pandemic peak of $10.81.Marina Bay saw the sharpest quarter-on-quarter rent growth at 3.4 per cent, among the four CBD sub-markets tracked by JLL, due to its relatively new and good quality office developments.

This is similar to contract sizes recorded in 2022 and 2021.National Development Minister Desmond Lee told a BCA-Redas (Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore) seminar at Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel on Thursday that even though construction demand appears to be steady, firms must keep in mind the challenges that lie ahead, such as the growing risk of recession in major economies, supply chain pressures and climate change. It is important that we take in the lessons learnt over the past few years to enhance the built environment sectors resilience. This includes reducing our reliance on foreign manpower for labour-intensive tasks, and doing more to fulfil our net-zero climate goals, he said.The public sector is expected to contribute about 60 per cent of the total construction demand this year, or between $16 billion and $19 billion.Private-sector construction demand is anticipated to reach $11 billion to $13 billion, comparable with 2022, with the planned development of new condominiums and high-specification industrial buildings.The BCA said: Due to the rescheduling of some major projects from 2022 to 2023, as well as the redevelopment of old commercial premises to enhance asset values, commercial building demand is anticipated to increase.In 2022, construction demand in the public sector rose slightly to $17.9 billion, from $17.8 billion in 2021. This was underpinned by projects such as the first phase of the Cross Island Line, Jurong Region Line and healthcare facilities for the Ministry of Health.Meanwhile, demand in the private sector dipped from $12.1 billion in 2021 to $11.9 billion in 2022, due to economic downsides.BCA figures showed that progress payments for work being done are projected to hit $30 billion to $33 billion this year, on a par with the preliminary estimate of about $30.2 billion for 2022. This is due to a steady level of construction demand and some backlog of remaining workloads impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, said the authority.Mr Lee said that projected demand from 2024 to 2027 will be between $25 billion and $32 billion a year, and the public sector will be the main driver, with upcoming projects such as the Cross Island Line and several hospital developments.On Thursday, several companies also signed agreements to explore collaborative efforts and develop capabilities. For instance, property group UOL will work with United Tec Construction to adopt advanced prefab mechanical, electrical and plumbing technologies.Singapore Contractors Association Limited (Scal) president Ng Yek Meng said that despite the stable outlook for 2023, firms are expected to face higher construction costs. Material and manpower costs have gone up by 30 per cent to 40 per cent compared with pre-pandemic levels, he added.We need to reduce our dependency on foreign workers. On our end, Scal is trying to streamline the construction process and educate members to use more productive methods in construction, he said. Kimly Construction director Roy Khoo said the companys suppliers are anticipating costs of raw materials such as steel to further increase in the coming months, as China opens up its economy. To counter rising costs, the firm is looking to improve its productivity through Design for Manufacturing and Assembly, which is a way of prefabricating structures in an off-site facility before assembling them on site, saving time and manpower. With digitalisation and collaboration with our stakeholders, we are able to plan more accurately, so this cuts down on wastage of labour and materials. This has helped to mitigate most of our losses, Mr Khoo said.

Developers pay an LBC which replaced the development charge (DC) for the right to enhance the use of some sites or to build bigger projects on them. The hotel sector saw the biggest increase in LBC rates as the hospitality industry has benefited from pent-up leisure and business travel demand boosting room and occupancy rates. However, LBC rates are unchanged for most other use groups, including industrial and commercial ones, given the weaker manufacturing environment and high borrowing costs, which have dampened commercial investment sales, said Mr Wong Xian Yang, head of research at Cushman & Wakefield.For the residential sector, the moderate increase in LBC should offer some relief for developers whose landbanking has been dampened by two rounds of cooling measures and a recent hike in buyers stamp duties for pricier residential and non-residential properties. Despite record low levels of unsold inventory, land acquisition activities have been muted as development risks rose with higher construction costs andinterest rates, and sales slowed amid an uncertain economic outlook. The Government applied a soft touch to this current review, said Ms Tay Huey Ying, head of research and consultancy at JLL Singapore.LBC rates have been raised by an average of 0.3 per cent for non-landed residential use, down from a 12.9 per cent increase in the previous revision in September. This is in line with a slower land sales market and developers measured bids during the previous review period, Ms Tay said. For landed residential use, LBC rates have been raised by an average of 0.4 per cent, down from a 10.2 per cent rise in the previous revision, as the price growth for landed homes has stabilised amid slowing sales. But CBREs head of research for South-east Asia Tricia Song believes the flattish LBC rates may not boost en bloc activities much, in the light of the recent increase in marginal buyers stamp duty.ERA Realty head of research and consultancy Nicholas Mak disagreed, pointing out that the average increase in LBC rates is relatively small and affects only a minority of the 118 sectors for residential developments. The new revision of LBC should be welcomed by both developers and sellers of en bloc sale properties, he said.The largest increase in LBC of 5 per cent came from the area bound by Bedok South Avenue 1, New Upper Changi Road, Bedok Road and Upper East Coast Road, possibly due to the collective sale of Bagnall Court in January, said Knight Franks head of capital markets for land and collective sales, Ms Chia Mein Mein.The eastern part of Singapore should remain an attractive prospect for en bloc sales, she added, as estates such as Upper East Coast Road, Siglap Road, Bayshore, Bedok, Loyang and Changi saw only slight increases of 2.2 per cent to 3 per cent in LBC rates. Some potential collective sale projects in this area include Mandarin Gardens and Laguna Park, Ms Chia said.For the hotel/hospital sector, the rise of 1 per cent in LBC rates marks the first increase since March 2019. During the pandemic, LBC rates for this group were left unchanged, except for a 7.8 per cent downward adjustment in September 2020, said Mr Lam Chern Woon, head of research and consulting at Edmund Tie.But with borders reopening, the hospitality industry should continue to benefit from a recovery in leisure and business travel, given more Mice(meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) events scheduled this year, Mr Lam said. He noted that the highest increases of 10.2 per cent were recorded in sectors along the prime tourism belt in Tanglin, Orchard, City Hall, Marina Centre and Marina Bay. Other neighbouring sectors saw increases of 3.9 per cent to 6.6 per cent. The improved connectivity in areas like Tanglin and Havelock following the opening of new stations along the Thomson-East Coast Line would have been factored into the current review, he added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Not only could this destabilise the market, it does not address the underlying cause, he said in his Budget debate round-up speech on Friday (Feb 24). Current high prices are not due to land costs, but Covid-era supply issues.From 2013 to 2019, HDB resale prices actually fell for six consecutive years. No one seemed to be unduly concerned about the prices of new flats (then), said Wong. On the contrary, there was a great anxiety that there would be a huge overhang of flats, and we would end up with a price meltdown.This changed when the pandemic delayed Singapores Build-To-Order (BTO) programme, thus disrupting supply and causing longer waiting times. People felt anxious and more started applying for BTO flats earlier; others decided to get a resale flat instead.More funding would be required to make new flats cheaper, but the Workers Party (WP) does not want to discuss increasing subsidies and taxpayers burdens, said Wong. Instead, the WP has proposed selling state land to HDB at a lower cost, which they probably think is a more expedient and seemingly painless option to lower prices.But we must remember that public housing land is sold directly to HDB at a fair market value, he noted. These valuations are based on objective facts. They are not an arbitrary opinion.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Public housing land itself is not sold through an open tender because HDB is the only developer, but flats are sold in the open market, he said. There is a well-established open market value for the flats, and therefore working backwards, one can calculate the value of the land used to build HDB flats.The bottom line is, you cannot just change the way land is priced to bring down the selling price of flats, he said. If you were to try to artificially reset the housing market in this manner, you will risk destabilising the entire property market.Instead, what needs to be done is to tackle the root cause of the high prices, by ramping up BTO supply and catching up with the delays that arose in the pandemic, he explained.As it will take time for supply to go up, the government has addressed demand in the meantime. Budget 2023 introduced greater BTO priority for first-timer families with children and couples aged 40 and below.The CPF Housing Grant for resale flats has also been increased, to help eligible first-timer families and singles with more urgent needs. Wong noted MPs concerns that this may cause resale sellers to demand higher prices, and added: There will always be a risk like this when we increase the grants.But that is why, before deciding on this move, the government considered earlier property cooling measures and HDBs progress in ramping up BTO supply. The grants impact is also limited, he pointed out, adding that only about a third of resale buyers receive it: This is a targeted support measure, rather than a broad-based move."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This is despite worsening economic sentiment and layoffs in the tech sector. Knight Frank Singapore indicated that prime-grade office rents in the Raffles Place/Marina Bay precinct increased 1.3 per cent quarter on quarter in the first quarter, averaging $10.83 per sq ft per month.Occupancy levels in the CBD remained broadly unchanged compared with the previous quarter, with 94.1 per cent of office buildings occupied.Prime office spaces in Raffles Place/Marina Bay had an occupancy level of 95.4 per cent, a slight dip from 95.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022.Knight Frank attributes the steady occupancy rates to selected office buildings undergoing redevelopment or asset enhancement, which helped to remove stock from the market.On Monday, Knight Frank noted that there is a high demand for quality office spaces that foster a superior work experience. This comes as companies seek to attract their employees to return to the office as productivity becomes key, in view of the deteriorating business outlook.Quality office spaces remained full as businesses continued to relocate headquarter functions to Singapore, with the city-state a flight-to-safety hub amid seemingly unrelenting global disruptions, observed the consultancy, referring to the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse coming under stress.One such example is the newly completed Guoco Midtown, which Knight Frank notes to have an 80 per cent occupancy rate from tenants across industries, due to favourable supply-led-demand dynamics.As supply of new office inventory continues to remain tight, especially in the CBD, the upward rental trend continued to reflect a resilient market, it added.Projects expected to contribute to upcoming office supply across Singapore include IOI Central Boulevard Towers in Downtown, One Holland Village in Queenstown and the Surbana Jurong Campus in Cleantech Loop.Prime office rents are thus expected to be stable with an increment to be around 3 per cent for the whole of 2023, Knight Frank added.

The Russia-Ukraine war, inflation and interest rate hikes were just some of the incidents that contributed to the volatility. Several major global indices experienced more than double-digit losses in their closing prices. The US S&P 500, the China CSI 300 and the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index fell 19.5 per cent, 21.7 per cent and 15.5 per cent, respectively. The S&P 500 even experienced high-frequency intraday volatility, with swings of over 1 per cent for 87 per cent of trading days in 2022. A similar situation was also observed in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which fell by 3.1 per cent in December 2022.Bucking the trend was Singapores Straits Times Index (STI), which outperformed most of the global indices and had a positive gain of 4.1 per cent. The Singapore market has proven to be a haven in these volatile times.The STI is built on value stocks. For the uninitiated, this means it takes time for their prices to go up. Consequently, many deem them boring. The spotlight often lands on growth stocks. With their high price-to-earnings ratios and low (or no) dividend payments, these naturally appear more interesting to those seeking rapid price appreciations.But the environment in the past year has not been right for growth stocks, especially since they tend to be highly leveraged. As we have seen, higher interest rates have a negative impact on these stocks and thus the indices that track them. The S&P 500, for instance, is notoriously tech-heavy, with the tech sector accounting for more than a quarter of the index. The sector and by proxy the S&P 500 suffered a bruising year. Recession fears are not making 2023 any brighter for the sector now.The STI, on the other hand, comprises largely banks, which account for 44 per cent of the index. The rest of the index is made up of telcos, industrials and real estate investment trusts (Reits). Reits make up 22 per cent of the index, and industrials 10.1 per cent. The index houses 30 of Singapores largest companies. These stocks are defensive in nature, offering consistent dividends and stable earnings. They might be dull, but they can potentially offer greater levels of defence and there is value in that, especially during volatile times.Friday, 8.30 amBusiness insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies.Singapore is the largest Reit market in Asia ex-Japan, with a total market capitalisation of S$110 billion. Reits are classified as value stocks, with a requisite to distribute at least 90 per cent of their net earnings to unitholders.Reits, like tech stocks, are a highly leveraged asset class and have not been spared the pain of interest rate hikes. The iEdge S-Reit Index, which tracks the performances of Singapore Reits, suffered an unusually huge loss of 24.3 per cent from April to October 2022. There are, however, signs that the US Federal Reserve may slow the pace of interest rate hikes in the coming year. This may be a positive sign for Reits and, by extension, the STI, since Reits make up a huge proportion of the index. Prior to 2022, Reits performed relatively well. They generated 6 per cent in total returns in 2021, which may make them appealing to investors seeking steady returns.The wider stability of Singapore has also helped the market post growth in volatile times.Stock market trends are influenced by geopolitical tensions. Strained relations between the US and China in August 2022 led to the S&P 500 dropping 0.67 per cent, while the Nasdaq shed 0.16 per cent.Singapore, being politically neutral and located strategically for business flows, will continue to offer investment opportunities and access to a wealthy clientele based in neighbouring countries.Its strong regulatory system affords such clients the assurance that they can grow their wealth in a safe jurisdiction. In fact, Singapores advanced business infrastructure has attracted many to establish family offices here or expand their client base in the region. Singapores assets under management (AUM) grew 17 per cent in 2020, outpacing global AUM growth of 11 per cent. There were 700 family offices in Singapore at the end of 2021, up from 400 at the end of 2020, based on the Monetary Authority of Singapores estimates.A looming recession and ongoing geopolitical tensions are some of the issues investors will have to grapple with this year. Amid these uncertainties, the Singapore market shines through and is not to be dismissed. With sound policies, strategic decision-making and a rigorous regulatory system, Singapore is well-equipped to weather the storms that come its way.Singapore has the makings of a boring market. If boring offers peace of mind and potential growth, however, then why not consider it?The writer is a trading strategist at OCBC Securities."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Analysts expect the lacklustre performance to continue for some time.Output last month fell 3.1 per cent year on year, dragged down by volatile biomedical production even as electronics turned positive, according to data released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) on Thursday. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output edged up 0.3 per cent.Overall production performed better than the 6.9 per cent contraction forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg poll. It was also a slight improvement on the 3.8 per cent fall in November. Production shrank for the first time in a year in October on a slump in pharmaceuticals production and weakness in the linchpin electronics sector.OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said it was too early to bring out the champagne, although Decembers manufacturing numbers were better than expected. It could potentially get worse in the first quarter of 2023 before it gets better in the second to fourth quarters, she said, noting that growth was limited to transport engineering and electronics, and that the global chips sector may not be out of the woods yet.She added: Recent news suggests that Japan and Netherlands may join US efforts to restrict tech exports to China by as early as end-January. Global recession and demand slowdown risks also remain prevalent, so demand from major markets like the US, EU and UK may stay soft in the near term. RHB senior economist Barnabas Gan said the outlook for manufacturing will likely be lacklustre at least in the first halfof 2023. We remain cautious about China given economic headwinds, since its the biggest buyer globally of chips and petrochemicals...But there is a silver lining for manufacturing in F&B (food and beverage) and aviation as the gradual opening of borders has helped these industries, said Mr Gan, who expects manufacturing to expand by 0 per cent to 2 per cent for the whole of this year. Total output grew by 2.5 per cent last year, or 4 per cent excluding biomedical manufacturing, according to the EDB data. Maybank economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Yealso expect manufacturing to continue declining in the first half of 2023, mainly due to electronics, but said the industrys downturn might be shallow.Chinas reopening could help cushion the downturn from the US and Europe, and reduce the odds of a recession, they said. For December, electronics output grew 4.6 per cent, reversing falls of 12.4 per cent in November and 0.7 per cent in October.The sector accounts for 40 per cent of Singapores export-driven manufacturing sector and thus is key to economic growth.Dr Chua and Ms Lee said electronics grew for the first time in six months to record its highest output since May 2022.We think the positive print is encouraging but may not last, as semiconductors will likely fall at a steeper pace in the first half of 2023 on the back of weaker global demand and also relative to last years high base, they said. Output for infocomms and consumer electronics rose 16.9 per cent, while computer peripherals and data storage grew 0.9 per cent.But semiconductor production continued to shrink, dipping 0.3 per cent, while the other electronic modules and components segment tumbled 13.5 per cent on the back of softening demand.UOB senior economist Alvin Liew saidthe semiconductor rebound the latest dip was better than Novembers 14 per cent drop is likely temporary. His bank expects manufacturing to contract by 5.4 per cent in 2023 due to the faltering outlook for electronics and weaker external demand.Pointing to the continued decline of Asia-Pacific semiconductor sales, he said: That does not bode well for semiconductor demand, while affirming the weak electronics outlook.Overall, the electronics clusters output grew 2.6 per cent in 2022.Transport engineering output also grew, by 9.3 per cent in December, extending the 18.6 per cent growth in November and 6.8 per cent increase in October.The aerospace segment expanded 27.2 per cent with more maintenance, repair and overhaul jobs from commercial airlines on the back of increased global air traffic.But marine and offshore engineering dipped 0.5 per cent while the land segment shrank 18.6 per cent. The transport engineering cluster grew 18.8 per cent for the whole of 2022.Other sectors saw poorer performance in December.Biomedical manufacturing output declined 20.3 per cent, reversing the 9 per cent growth in November.The medical technology segment contracted 14.7 per cent with lower export demand for medical devices, while pharmaceuticals output fell 24.3 per cent due to a different mix of active ingredients being produced compared with a year ago.Overall, the biomedical manufacturing clusters output dropped 5 per cent last year.Chemicals output also fell in December, by 9.5 per cent, extending the 11.4 per cent drop in November and 9.3 per cent decline in October.The petroleum segment grew 6.3 per cent, buoyed by higher demand for jet fuel, while other chemicals rose 4.4 per cent due to an increase in production of fragrances.But the specialities segment declined 7.1 per cent due to lower production of industrial gases and food additives. The petrochemicals segment also saw output fall, by 22.2 per cent, due to weak market demand and plant maintenance shutdowns.On the whole, the chemicals clusters output declined 5.5 per cent in 2022.General manufacturing output fell 2.8 per cent in December 2022, sharper than the 0.5 per cent dip in November and 0.7 per cent decline in October.But its output rose 10.1 per cent for the whole of last year.Precision engineering output dropped 4.1 per cent in December, after the 4.1 per cent growth in November and 19.6 per cent increase in October.

The collective sale committee of Orchard Towers did not obtain the required threshold for the collective sale and therefore the collective sale process will not proceed, Hiap Hoe said in a statement.The Business Times reported in February 2022 that the collective sale committee of Orchard Towers had recommended setting a reserve price of $1.6 billion for a collective sale. The potential deal was then said to possibly become the most expensive collective sale in Singapores history. Completed in the early 1970s, Orchard Towers has a plot ratio of 4.9 and a site area of about 6,130 sq m.The freehold development spans two buildings, with retail and office space in the front tower along Orchard Road, and some commercial units and 58 private residential units in the rear 25-storey tower along Claymore Road. There are 361 carpark lots. Collective sale of the development, known for its sleaze and nightlife business, gained traction in July 2022, when the police said public entertainment licences for nightclubs and bars at Orchard Towers will not be renewed beyond May 2023.This was said to be part of the Singapore authorities continued efforts to manage law and order at the building. Market watchers say the failure of the collective sale of Orchard Towers shows the challenges of putting together a deal in a big mixed development, where it is difficult to get a valuation and pricing acceptable to the different types of strata title owners.

This is because the drivers of the residential and commercial property markets are very different, he said in a written parliamentary reply to questions on the latest ABSD revisions filed by Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), Mr Shawn Huang (Jurong GRC) and Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC).He added: Demand for commercial properties tends to be driven by business considerations, and commercial property transactions are generally of much higher value than for residential properties. Individual buyers make up nearly all of the residential property market but only about 10 per cent of the commercial property market.Historically, commercial property prices and transaction volumes have also remained stable in the period following past increases to the ABSD rates.The fourth round of ABSD hikes since 2011 is aimed at preventing property prices from being pushed up by investors and prioritising Singaporeans buying homes for owner-occupation. The authorities announced on April 26 that the ABSD rate for foreigners buying any residential property in Singapore will double to 60 per cent, from 30 per cent.For Singapore citizens, the rate will be raised from 17 per cent to 20 per cent for those buying their second residential property, and from 25 per cent to 30 per cent for those getting their third and subsequent property.Singapore permanent residents (PRs) buying their second residential property will see the rate rise from 25 per cent to 30 per cent, and from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for third and subsequent properties.The new property curbs also come as private home prices jumped 3.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, after rising 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022.Foreign interest in Singapore residential property, as an asset class, is rising again, even though earlier cooling measures and border closures over the past two years had helped to moderate it.On concerns over rising rental prices and the impact on business costs, Mr Lee said: We do not expect the recent ABSD revisions to have a significant impact on the rental market. The vast majority of foreigners working in Singapore rent their homes and will not be affected by the recent ABSD revisions. The tight supply conditions brought on by the pandemic had led to an exceptional imbalance in the rental market. However, we expect to see signs of easing, with a large number of new residential units being completed over the next few years. We are expecting 40,000 home completions this year the highest in the last five years and about 100,000 completions by 2025. Households temporarily renting while awaiting the completion of their new homes will also move out of their rental units and into their new homes. Mr Lee said: We therefore expect pressures in the rental market to ease with this large supply entering the market, and we already see early indications that rental demand is abating. This will moderate rent increases in the coming quarters.He added that the Government will continue to keep a close eye on both the commercial and residential property markets and take further steps, if necessary, to promote a stable and sustainable property market.Separately, Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) asked if the Government will tighten the process involving decoupling by families or couples to acquire additional residential properties and avoid paying ABSD. He also asked if the Ministry of Finance will tighten processes for foreign families who buy multiple properties under the names of different family members to avoid ABSD.Responding, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said theGovernment recognises that families and individuals may enter into various property purchase and ownership arrangements for different reasons and needs, and taking into account the tax and non-tax consequences. Depending on the arrangement, ABSD may be payable. Today, ABSD is tiered by property count for Singaporean citizen and permanent resident buyers. No ABSD applies for Singaporean citizen buyers purchasing their first residential property, Mr Wong said. Foreigners are liable for the highest individual ABSD rate of 60 per cent, regardless of the number of properties they own. So, even if foreign families buy multiple properties under the names of different family members, they will still have to pay the ABSD of 60 per cent for each property.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Central office rents have been moving upwards since 2021.Prices of office space in the central region were flat in the first quarter, compared with the 3.7 per cent increase in the previous quarter. Islandwide, at the end of the first quarter, the total supply of office space in the pipeline came to about 837,000 sq m of gross floor area (GFA), a 4 per cent fall from the 872,000 sq m at the end of the previous quarter. Net demand, as measured by the amount of occupied office space, rose by 21,000 sq m in the first quarter of 2023, compared with an increase of 9,000 sq m in the previous quarter. The stock of office space also increased by 14,000 sq m in the first quarter of 2023, after contracting by 23,000 sq m in the previous quarter.As a result, the islandwide vacancy rate of office space declined to 11.2 per cent as at end-March, from 11.3 per cent as at the end of December. Retail rents, meanwhile, dipped 0.3 per cent in the first quarter, a smaller decline after the 1.1 per cent drop in the fourth quarter of 2022.Prices of retail space in the central region fell by 0.9 per cent following a 2.1 per cent decrease in the previous quarter. On an islandwide basis, as at the end of the first quarter, there was a total supply of 407,000 sq m of GFA of retail space from projects in the pipeline, down 3.1 per cent from 420,000 sq m as at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The amount of occupied retail space fell by 7,000 sq m of net lettable area (NLA) in the first quarter, compared with an increase in NLA of 66,000 sq m in the previous quarter. The stock of retail space increased by about 25,000 sq m of NLA in the first quarter of 2023, a slightly larger increase than the 24,000 sq m increase in the previous quarter. This resulted in the islandwide vacancy rate of retail space rising to 7.6 per cent as at end-March, from 7.1 per cent as at the end of December. THE BUSINESS TIMES"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The landlords of downtown San Franciscos largest mall have abandoned it. A new Hong Kong skyscraper is only a quarter leased.The creeping rot inside commercial real estate is like a dark seam running through the global economy. Even as stockmarkets rally and investors are hopeful that the fastest interest-rate increases in a generation will ebb, the trouble in property is set to play out for years. After a long buying binge fueled by cheap debt, owners and lenders are grappling with changes in how and where people work, shop and live in the wake of the pandemic. At the same time, higher interest rates are making it more expensive to buy or refinance buildings. A tipping point is coming: In the US alone, about US$1.4 trillion (S$1.9 trillion) of commercial real estate loans are due this year and next, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. When the deadline arrives, owners facing large principal payments may prefer to default instead of borrowing again to pay the bill.Major institutional owners including Blackstone, Brookfield and Pimco have already chosen to stop payments on some buildings because they have better uses for their cash and resources. Theres significant stress, said Mr Harold Bordwin, a principal in New York at Keen-Summit Capital Partners LLC, which specializes in renegotiating distressed real estate. He said: People dont give up assets so easily unless they just dont see any hope and they recognize that theyre pretty well underwater.The number of transactions is plungingand when deals do happen, the price declines are stark. In the US, where return-to-office rates have been lower than in Asia and Europe, values for institutional-quality offices are down 27 per cent since March 2022, when interest rates started going up, according to data analytics company Green Street. Apartment building prices have declined 21 per cent, and malls are off 18 per cent. Office prices are expected to fall more than 25 per cent in Europe and almost 13 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region before hitting a trough according to PGIM Real Estate, a unit of Prudential Financial Inc.What PGIM analysts have called the great reset of values is likely to be agonizingly slow. It took six years for US office prices to recover after the 2008 financial crisis, even though that episode was centered on residential real estate. This time we think itll take 10 years, said Mr Richard Barkham, global chief economist for CBRE Group.Commercial real estates woes will add to the stress on a financial system thats already reeling from this years crisis in regional banks. And as the downturn deepens, it stands to have a transformational impact on some cities as they contend with empty buildings and lower property tax revenue.The question is whether the commercial property correction will be big enough to destabilize the wider economy. As broad as the forces arrayed against the real estate sector may be, its also very local business, encompassing not only urban skyscrapers but small-town shopping centers, suburban apartment buildings and sprawling warehouse parks.Cities all have different stories to tell, said Mr Peter Hayes, a managing director of investment research for PGIM Real Estate in London. Theyve all been changed by different localized shocks. You end up in a world where investors have to think more about geography than they have.Already, debt distress has stretched from Los Angeles to Sweden and South Korea. Heres how the troubles are unfolding in some major financial and business centers around the world.Nowhere in the US is the crisis more pronounced than in San Francisco, where a downward trendis gathering momentum as one building after another slips into default. Property prices in the tech hub reached record heights in the past decade, so they had a long way to fall. The city boomed with hot startupsAirbnb, Twitter, Uber Technologiesalong with established giants such as Salesforce. Now many of them have cut jobs and office space.The downtown is struggling to re-attract employers and employees who flourished working remotely. The area consists largely of office towers, leaving it feeling particularly empty. Those workers who do come in endure among the nations longest average commutes. San Franciscos homelessness crisis is also concentrated downtown, and highly publicized retail theft has led to some stores closing.In the once-fashionable Union Square district, the owners of the citys largest mall, Westfield San Francisco Centre, in June essentially handed the keys over to holders of a US$558 million mortgage. The move came after Nordstrom Inc. announced it was shutting its department store in the complex. With tourism slow to rebound from the pandemic, Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. has stopped payments on US$725 million in debt tied to two of the citys biggest hotels, Hilton San Francisco Union Square and the Parc 55 San Francisco.Veritas Investments Inc., a major local landlord, defaulted on US$675 million in debt on a portfolio of apartments valued at more than US$1 billion in 2020. The loans are now on the market.The office-vacancy and availability rate has tripled from pre-pandemic days. In one of the citys few office deals, Wells Fargo & Co. recently sold a 13-floor tower at 550 California St. for about US$200 per square foot, down from the 2019 market peak of more than US$1,000, according to Newmark Group Inc., a real estate services company. Lower prices are getting some investors to consider potential opportunities. Weve never bought in San Francisco, said Mr Mike Pestronk, chief executive officer of Post Brothers, a developer in Philadelphia with US$4 billion in multifamily property. He added: But it seems like its getting very interesting.But whats interesting to an outsider is excruciating for owners. Theres no way to avoid the price reset thats coming, said Mr David Bitner, an analyst in San Francisco for Newmark. Office is bearing the brunt, but theres also older retail and more recent multifamily thats being affected.The citys coffers are taking a hit, with Mayor London Breed projecting a $780 million two-year budget deficit. She proposed diversifying the downtown, including the conversion of more buildings to housing, and suggested the Westfield mall could be used in other ways, reflecting a new vision for the property. For now, theres a lot of empty space to fill.Although New York Citys streets are bustling with tourists and residents, only about half of office workers are back at their desk, according to building security company Kastle Systems. Scores of buildings are struggling with the loss of tenants and the need for upgrades. As employers work out their updated office needs, they can choose spaces in newly built towers in such areas as Hudson Yards or near Grand Central Terminal rather than aging properties.These choices helped put even iconic buildings in the worlds financial capital into troubled situations. At the Seagram Building, a 1950s skyscraper in Midtown thats renowned architecturally for its modernist design, owner RFR Holding had to negotiate a one-year extension on US$1 billion of debt set to mature this year after failing to secure financing. RFR spent $25 million on upgrades, including a vast sports complex and a wellness center, and the property was 95 per cent leased as of earlier this year. Still, it lost Wells Fargo to a newer development prior to the pandemic, while private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice is relocating to a renovated Madison Avenue tower.Developer GFP Real Estate received a two-year extension on the DuMont building, an art deco tower on Madison Avenue, after being unable to repay the US$103 million mortgage when it came due. To hash out the deal, GFP had to commit capital for helping to boost its future leasing prospects in the building.Mayor Eric Adams has called for a wider return to the office, urging Wall Street leaders to enforce more in-person work. Offices, expected to reach a record 22.7 per cent vacancy rate this year, typically account for about 20 per cent of the citys property tax revenue. A joint study from researchers at New York University and Columbia University found that offices in the city will lose 44 per cent of their pre-pandemic value by 2029 because of the impact of remote work.The landlords are really seeing a real witches brew of obstacles right nowtheyve got problems on every side, said Ms Ruth Colp-Haber, CEO of brokerage Wharton Property Advisors. She said: The best buildings with the top owners are going to hang on, and theyre going to get through this. But for the buildings that have a large vacancy and also need a lot of work, the economics just arent going to pan out.Atlanta and Other BoomtownsCities beyond the US coastal financial centers are feeling the pain, too. Atlantas office availability rate for lease and sublease climbed to 31 per cent in the first quarter, almost double the pre-pandemic level, according to British real estate services company Savills Plc. Companies are looking for smaller spaces in hotter neighborhoods.Tenants vacated an additional 290,000 square feet in downtown Atlanta class A office space in the first quarter, according to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. Some demand shifted to Midtown, where asking rents are 44 per cent higher than downtown and tenants added a net 32,000 square feet. Landlords are facing a wall of balloon payments: Almost 30 per cent of the Georgia capitals office space has debt maturing between now and 2025, more than any US metro area, according to Yardi Systems Inc., which makes property management software.There are similar stories across the Sun Belt and the mountain West, where many workers and companies relocated during the pandemic. Even Austin, which emerged as a low-cost alternative to Silicon Valley, now faces surging vacancies that will make it harder for landlords to raise rents. Space available for sublease more than doubled in the Texas capital since June 2022, to 5.9 million square feet, the fastest rise of any US metro area, according to CoStar Group Inc. Only San Francisco and San Jose have higher shares to sublet. Austin has had a breathtaking increase, said Mr Phil Mobley, CoStars national director of US office analytics. Tech companies definitely have a propensity to work remotely.Elsewhere, new supply is meeting falling demand. In Colorado, a pair of towers built in the late 1970s, formerly the Denver Energy Center, are for sale after lenders seized them. The buildings are only 32 per cent leased. Lenders have also taken over Houstons Pinnacle at Westchase, a nine-floor suburban office complex whose appraised value is off more than 75 per cent compared with 2012, according to loan documents.Theres a widening divide between winners and losers, said Mr Doug Ressler, senior research officer for Yardi. Its bifurcated, he says. The trophies should hold up. The B and C offices are going to have to look to repurpose.But not every old building can find a new purpose. Its really hard to turn a 1990s office tower into something other than a 1990s office tower, said Ms Lea Overby, a commercial real estate analyst with Barclays Capital Inc. Its just not cool.The widespread adoption of hybrid working is hitting London unevenly. Office vacancy rates in Londons West End, home to the citys buzziest retail and nightspots, are almost at record lows as companies look for space in the best buildings and locations to help lure workers back. Rents are rising, too, because companies are prepared to pay more per square foot, while taking less space overall.The Canary Wharf district, home to 1990s-era glass-and-steel towers, is in the deepest trouble. The neighborhood, perceived by most as a place built solely for bankers, is having a harder time staying relevant for major office tenants. Law firm Clifford Chance is leaving in favor of a newand much smalleroffice in the more centrally located City of London district. HSBC Holdings Plc is looking for a new headquarters, with most of its shortlisted options in the City as well. The YY building, a recently completed redevelopment of Thomson Reuters Corp.s former headquarters that occupies the prime site right outside the Canary Wharf tube station, remains entirely vacant.Two office buildings that were considered trophy only a few years ago are now in the hands of lenders. A consortium led by Lloyds Banking Group Plc appointed receivers on 5 Churchill Place and 20 Canada Square after the buildings owner, Chinas Cheung Kei Group, failed to repay loans secured against them. Both face vacancies and significant costs for refurbishment.Another issue looming over Londons real estate market is the prospect that hundreds of buildings will be rendered obsolete because they dont meet UK environmental regulations. Properties are graded on energy performance, from A to G. By 2030 it will be illegal to rent commercial buildings that are ranked below B. That leaves landlords forced to make costly upgrades or risk offices sitting empty. Brexit has also contributed to London losing some of its financial allure, says PGIMs Hayes. Office buildings are very, very vulnerable for the near term, he says.For Swedens property market, the main problem isnt vacant offices but the sheer amount of debt some property companies amassed during the era of rock-bottom rates. A lot of that financing came from short-term and floating-rate bonds, so yields and costs are going to soar. Landlords in the biggest Nordic nation must roll over or refinance US$42 billion of bonds over the next five years, nearly a third of which falls due next year.No company typifies the problem more than SBB, as Samhallsbyggnadsbolaget i Norden AB is more commonly known. The social housing landlord began to see its US$13 billion empire unravel following a downgrade to junk in early May. Asset sales and a scrapped dividend havent been enough to arrest a slide in its share price, which is down more than 90 per cent since the end of 2021. SBB is currently the subject of a probe by the countrys financial watchdog into whether it violated accounting rules, and its founder has been ousted as chief executive.A 26-floor building with a sweeping view of Hong Kongs famed Victoria Harbour made headlines in the city in 2015 when China Evergrande Group, not a global name at the time, purchased it for US $1.6 billionmore than double the previous record for an office tower. The deal exemplified the property market boom in the Asian financial hub, which in the years that followed attracted ambitious Chinese capital to buy everything from office blocks to land plots, often at record-breaking prices. Investing in offices appeared to be a safe bet in a city with tight space and strong demand from mainland Chinese companies.Then came antigovernment protests and the strict lockdown measures of Covid-19 in 2020, which made investors rethink Hong Kongs status as a financial hub. Adding to the turmoil: a Chinese property debt crisis, with Evergrande at the center.With hundreds of billions of dollars in debt, the developer sought to raise cash in every way possible and, in late 2020, pledged the office building to a bank in return for a HK$7.6 billion (S$ 1.3 billion) loan. Last year a receiver took over the property. The new owner put the building up for sale but failed to get a bid that reached its target. The tower is now only about 25 per cent occupied, in part because prospective tenants are put off by its complicated ownership. It was fully occupied when Evergrande bought it.Across the city, cost-conscious foreign banks and Chinese companies are no longer taking up space at a time when new supply is increasing. The vacancy rate for top-tier Hong Kong office buildings climbed to 15 per cent in April, more than three times what it was in 2019, data from Colliers International Group Inc. show.Unlike landlords in New York and London, Hong Kongs cant blame remote work for the slump. The citys highly efficient public transport system and tiny apartments have given residents fewer reasons to work from home. The city is already back at the office; subway ridership surpassed 2019 levels in March.But the commercial market slump in a rising interest-rate environment still has property owners such as Evergrande in a tough situation. They cant refinance buildings because of falling values, nor can they easily find buyers for them. The choice is to sell at a steep discount or stomach interest payments. Instead of providing liquidity and stability, real estate assets have become a burden. BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It is also 22.2 per cent higher than the figure in the first quarter of 2022.Property consultancies Knight Frank and Edmund Tie, both of which hold auctions every month, saw higher numbers of mortgagee listings in the first three months of the year.Mortgagee listings at auctions conducted by Knight Frank more than trebled to 32 in the first quarter of 2023 from 10 in the previous quarter. But this was still a decrease from the 47 listings in the first quarter of 2022. Residential mortgagee listings more than doubled to 18 from the previous quarter, although they were still 14.3 per cent lower than the 21 in the first quarter of 2022. A non-landed home located in St Regis Residences was listed for receiver sale for two consecutive months, and eventually sold outside of auction for $13.5 million. Knight Franks retail and office mortgagee listings in the first quarter increased to four and three, respectively, from no listings in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, industrial listings more than trebled to seven from the last quarter. Knight Frank attributed the increase to a tougher business climate and rising interest rates, which it said have made business continuity challenging. Of the 32 listings, six were sold at auction and consisted of properties that were small-quantum listings, with transactions ranging from $350,000 to $1.1 million. Most were sold either at a discount or close to their opening prices, said Knight Frank. An office unit in Paya Lebar Square bucked the trend, selling at 1.8 per cent higher than the opening bid of $1 million, at $1.1 million. Knight Franks 18.8 per cent success rate for the quarter was a fall from the 30 per cent success rate in the last quarter, but still a rise from the 10.6 per cent in the year-ago period. At Edmund Tie, mortgagee listings rose to 28 in the first quarter of 2023, from 15 in the previous quarter. Half of the listings were residential, an increase from 10 in the last quarter. But this was still a decrease from the 30 in the first quarter of 2022. The companys retail and office listings also saw an increase from none in the previous quarter to two and five, respectively. Retail listings saw a year-on-year fall from 12 in the first quarter of 2022, but office listings increased from three in the previous year. Industrial listings saw a rise to seven from five in the last quarter, although this was still lower than the 11 listings in the first quarter of 2022. Edmund Tie noted that three industrial units in Yishun and Tuas of 1,755 sq ft, 1,808 sq ft and 2,443 sq ft were sold for $440,000, $460,000 and $350,000, respectively. Meanwhile, two residential apartments of 463 sq ft and 624 sq ft were sold for $790,000 and $955,000, respectively. A 506 sq ft office unit in Paya Lebar was sold for $1.1 million. Ms Joy Tan, head of auction and sales at Edmund Tie, said most buyers are adopting a wait-and-see approach due to high interest rates and the expected increase in public and private residential supply this year. Hence, activities in the auction market are expected to pick up pace onlyin the second half of the year, when buyers and sellers adjust their expectations accordingly, following a clearer sense of the market, she said. Knight Franks first-quarter report said more business owners may find it challenging to keep their businesses above water, and the firm expects to see more mortgagee listings in the second half, especially for workplace properties.

But they were split on whether the dampening of private property demand could lead to prices moderating over the next few months. Some analysts reckon prices are likely to hold firm due to the low number of unsold units in the market, while others said prices could moderate once home supply catches up.Foreigners were hit with the highest ABSD hike they now have to pay a rate of 60 per cent when buying any residential property, up from 30 per cent. The proportion of foreign buyers has steadily increased to 6.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, from a low of 3.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2022, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) data.Singaporeans buying their second residential property will have to pay an ABSD rate of 20 per cent, up from 17 per cent. Those buying their third and subsequent property will pay 30 per cent, up from 25 per cent.The rate for Singapore permanent residents (PRs) buying their second residential property will go up from 25 per cent to 30 per cent, and from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for third and subsequent properties.Provosts Chair Sing Tien Foo of the Department of Real Estate at the National University of Singapore said the aggressive ABSD hike for foreign buyers this round sends a clear message.The Government wants to discourage speculative buying, especially those who buy a large number of units to either park their money here or to flip the properties, he said. Singapore still welcomes foreign investments, but we dont want the capital flow to cause our housing market to be overheated as the priority now is to stabilise property prices for Singaporeans.Private property prices increased by 3.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, after showing signs of moderation in the fourth quarter of 2022 when prices rose by a marginal 0.4 per cent.In contrast, Singapores economy contracted 0.7 per cent quarter on quarter in the same period, some analysts noted.Edmund Tie head of research and consulting Lam Chern Woon said: The juxtaposition of accelerating home price growth with an economic contraction in the same quarter, coupled with unfettered housing demand going into the second quarter of 2023, has unsettled policymakers.The latest round of cooling measures, announced late on Wednesday night, will affect about 10 per cent of residential property transactions, based on 2022 data.As a higher proportion of foreigners and investment buyers typically shop for homes in the core central Singapore region, analysts expect demand for units in prime districts to be more affected. Ms Tricia Song, head of research at CBRE South-east Asia, said 12.1 per cent of private properties in central Singapore were bought by foreigners in 2022, compared with 4.4 per cent in the city fringes and 1.7 per cent in the suburbs.Hence, there may be more pressure on developers with projects in the core central region to rethink their product and pricing strategies. For launches in the core central region which are nearing completion or the ABSD deadline with unsold inventory, buyers may expect some discounts, said Ms Song.Huttons Asia senior director of research Lee Sze Teck said developers with projects in the high-end market may hold back launches for the time being as the market absorbs the cooling measures.But the mass market and city fringe projects are likely to go ahead with their launches as the buyers are predominantly Singaporeans and PRs, he said.At least one upcoming condo development in the core central region has pushed back its launch timeline in the light of the ABSD increases. The preview for Newport Residences in Anson Road in Tanjong Pagar was originally slated for this weekend, but a City Developments spokesman told The Straits Times that it will be rescheduled.With the latest property-related measures released by the Government on Wednesday, the market will need time to absorb the news. In the light of this, we will be rescheduling the preview, said the spokesman. We will monitor market conditions closely and unveil its launch at an appropriate time.EL Development managing director Lim Yew Soon told ST that the launch of the 275-unit Blossoms By The Park development in the one-north area will proceed as planned on Saturday.There will definitely be some impact on the demand due to the measures. However, I believe that the impact will be limited as buyers in the one-north area are usually Singaporeans and PRs rather than foreigners, he said.Analysts said investment demand by Singaporeans and PRs will likely moderate to some extent, and collective sales of sites in the high-end market could be harder to go through. But those upgrading or buying for their own stay will not be affected as ABSD rates for citizens buying their first residential property which constitutes about 90 per cent of residential property transactions will remain at 0 per cent. For PRs, the rate will stay at 5 per cent.In the months ahead, Singaporeans and PRs who are first-time buyers are expected to be key demand drivers, said ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim. Edmund Ties Mr Lam said: Genuine home-buying and upgrading demand remains unscathed and will likely benefit from a more gradual price trajectory going forward.OrangeTee & Ties senior vice-president of research and analytics, Ms Christine Sun, said the expected slowdown in demand in the coming months could provide a chance for home supply to catch up. When there is better market equilibrium, prices are likely to stabilise.

Ms Chia Siew Chuin, head of residential research at JLL, said: Nonetheless, developers are likely to seek out palatable development plots suitable for mass-market development projects as underlying demand for such homes is expected to remain resilient.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

However, plans are under way to lower the reserve price by 8.8per cent to $538 million.In a statement on Monday, sole marketing agent JLL said more than 50 per cent of the owners have signed the supplemental joint agreement to give their consent for the lower reserve price. A minimum support level of 80 per cent from the owners is required for the lower reserve price to be accepted.The previous tender for the property closed in April 2023 with no bids, and owners entered into private treaty negotiations. Mr Tan Hong Boon, executive director of capital markets at JLL, said at the time that interested buyers included both local and foreign developers.If the reserve price is lowered to $538 million, the land rate will be $1,898 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr) at a gross plot ratio (GPR) of 14.0. This is inclusive of a land betterment charge and a lease top-up premium to a fresh 99-year lease. At $590 million, the land rate stands at $2,035 psf ppr. Previously, the prime commercial property went up for sale en bloc in March 2012 with an indicative price of $530 million. Shenton House, a 99-year leasehold development in Shenton Way, sits on a land plot spanning 36,250 sq ft zoned for commercial use. It has a plot ratio of 11.2 under the Urban Redevelopment Authoritys Master Plan 2019. The site is eligible for a 25 per cent bonus gross floor area under the Central Business District Incentive Scheme until its expiry on Nov 26, 2024 where it can be redeveloped into a mixed-use or hotel development with a higher GPR of 14.0. The Shenton House site is located outside Shenton Way MRT station and is within walking distance to Downtown, Tanjong Pagar and Marina Bay MRT stations. It is also near expressways such as the Ayer Rajah Expressway and Marina Coastal Expressway.The propertys prime location in Shenton Way is ideal for Grade A offices that appeal to large corporations, with another redevelopment option being a hotel development, said JLL.

The ABSD rates for Singapore citizens and permanent residents (PRs) buying their first residential property remain unchanged at 0 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. Genuine homebuying and upgrading demand remains unscathed, and will likely benefit from a more gradual price trajectory going forward, Lam added.Following the latest measures, he has revised downwards his 2023 forecast for the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) private home price index from a 5 per cent to 7 per cent increase previously to a 4 per cent to 6 per cent increase. Last year, the index rose 8.6 per cent.The URAs flash estimate released earlier this month reflected a 3.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise in the index in Q1 2023.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Giving his take on the impetus for the sharp ABSD rate hike for foreigners, PropNex chief executive officer (CEO) Ismail Gafoor said: If things are left unchecked, there will be concerns among Singaporeans and PRs about their aspirations to own a private home. He pointed to the steady increase in foreign interest at new property launches.The foreign buying share of new non-landed private homes (excluding executive condominium or EC units) has risen from 4.3 per cent in 2021 to 7.3 per cent in 2022, climbing further to 9.9 per cent from Jan 1 to Apr 18 this year. The government is crystal clear. At the end of the day, if greater foreign interest is resulting in prices being pushed up, this is a no-go.That said, he agreed that the 60 per cent ABSD on foreign buyers is punitive. I think foreigners will seriously reconsider buying residential property in Singapore because they do have options in many other liveable cities around the world.Foreigners buying a S$20 million home here now have to pay S$12 million ABSD. For this amount, they can easily buy a luxury home in many other liveable cities such as Melbourne, London and in other mature markets.Instead, Ismail suggested the authorities could have opted for a tiered increase in ABSD rates on foreigners. If the government wants to protect Singaporeans aspirational housing needs, it could have imposed the 60 per cent rate on foreign purchases of properties below S$10 million. For properties above S$10 million - which are not within the range of the typical Singaporean first-time homebuyer - the ABSD could have been raised to, say, 40 per cent.This view is shared by Pua Seck Guan, chairman and CEO of Perennial Holdings, which leads a consortium that has teamed up with Alibaba to redevelop the former AXA Tower site on Shenton Way into an up to 200-unit luxury residential, hotel and office development.My concern is that having a flat 60 per cent ABSD rate on all Singapore residential property purchases by foreigners will chase away ultra-rich foreigners from Singapore. They are not buying mass-market condos, which remain the mainstay of Singaporeans and PRs. Furthermore, the doubling in ABSD comes at a time when Hong Kong is trying to draw back ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) and companies, having lost out to Singapore in the past couple of years, said Pua.Often, when well-heeled foreigners buy a residential property in Singapore, this is a first step to having a stake here. It is soon followed by a desire to be based here for longer periods of time and wanting to set up businesses here, which can generate spinoffs for our business ecosystem. This is similar to the strategy adopted in the early years after Singapores independence, of encouraging its citizens to own the roof over their heads for most, this would be an HDB flat to foster rootedness and give them a stake in the country.Unfortunately, the 60 per cent ABSD rate may send a message to foreign investors that they are not welcome in Singapore, he added.However, Jacqueline Wong, executive director of Savills Private Office, said the 60 per cent ABSD on foreigners is unlikely to take the shine off Singapores attraction as a wealth hub.Most UHNWIs who come to Singapore to set up a family office and be based here would eventually become a PR or Singapore citizen after having demonstrated their commitment to contribute to Singapores economy. In the interim, they will lease a home. So the 60 per cent ABSD on foreigners residential property purchase is not a consideration for those who can qualify to set up a family office, she added.While developers were spared any increase in ABSD rates this round, they are likely to rethink their land bidding strategy.Jeremy Lake, managing director of investment sales and capital markets at Savills Singapore, said the latest cooling measures will dampen bids from developers for sites, particularly in the prime districts 9, 10 and 11, where new private residential launches typically target a higher percentage of foreign buyers, who are most impacted by the higher ABSD.The price gap which has hindered collective sales over the last 12 months or so just got bigger, he added.In similar vein, CBREs head of research for South-east Asia, Tricia Song, said: While private-sector residential collective sales may continue to be challenging, we expect GLS (government land sales) to continue to be the favoured private housing land supply channel for developers. In the medium term, developers may prefer mass-market and even 99-year leasehold sites over prime and freehold locations, as these are more affordable and cater more to the owner-occupier market.Edmund Ties Lam said: Interest will remain strong for sites with exceptional attributes in the mass-market and EC segments, which are relatively isolated from the latest ABSD hikes.The ABSD rates for Singapore citizens and PRs buying their first residential property remain unchanged at 0 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. ABSD for Singaporeans on their second residential property purchasehas gone up from 17 per cent previously to 20 per cent. On third and subsequent residential properties, the rate has been raised by five percentage points to 30 per cent. ABSD for PRs on their second property has gone up from 25 per cent to 30 per cent; on the third and subsequent properties, the rate has increased from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.Property counters in Singapore started the morning largely in the red on the news. Developers City Developments Limited (CDL) and UOL Group, both constituents of the Straits Times Index (STI), led the STIs decline during the day. CDL fell 5.6 per cent or S$0.41 to S$6.91, while UOL lost 4.7 per cent or S$0.34 to close at S$6.85."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: CNA/Jeremy Long)SINGAPORE: Audits of a property purchase arrangement commonly known as a 99-to-1 scheme are part of regular checks by Singapore's tax authority to uncover \"contrived or artificial\" setups that home buyers use to avoid paying tax or stamp duties.The ongoing probe, which looks into arrangements where the ownership of a property is split in a 99:1 ratio, also covers those where the second owner has a share greater than 1 per cent, said the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) on Thursday (Apr 6) in response to CNA's queries.The Straits Times reported last weekend that IRAS had begun investigating cases of property purchases structured in a 99-to-1 manner for the purpose of avoidingthe Additional Buyers Stamp Duty (ABSD).The government introduced ABSD as a tax in 2011 to manage demand for property. Singaporeans must pay 17 per cent in ABSD when purchasing a second property, and 25 per cent on subsequent purchases.Those figures are higher for permanent residents and foreigners.ABSD is computed \"on the purchase price as stated in the dutiable document or the market value of the property\", whichever is the higher amount, according to the IRAS website.There are two ways to buy property in Singapore when there are two owners: One would be joint tenancy, which is commonly used by couples, where both parties will have an equal share of the property.The second way would be tenancy-in-common, which is commonly used for investment properties. Under this structure, the co-owners own a specific number of shares in the property and this could be split in any ratio, such as 80 to 20.IRAS is looking into the second way private property buyers who have entered into split agreements with the possible intention of avoiding ABSD.If the 99-to-1 intention is declared at the outset, the ABSD is payable as long as one party is an existing property owner.What IRAS is looking out for are cases ofpossible tax avoidance by buyers who have entered into a 99-to-1 scheme in which the 1 per cent stake is sold immediately after the purchase option is exercised.Using such an arrangement, where the 1 per cent stake is sold in the second stage, as an example:A person who owns a residential property buys a second. This means he is liable to pay ABSD of 17 per cent.If the property costs S$1 million (US$752,000) and he buys 1 per cent of this, his share of the property is S$10,000. Therefore, he has to pay 17 per cent of S$10,000 that is, S$1,700 as ABSD.In its statement on Thursday, IRAS said it would \"review the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrangement\".If it determines that tax avoidance has taken place, it will recover the rightful amount of stamp duty and impose a 50 per cent surcharge on the additional duty payable.If the stamp duty and surcharge are not paid by the deadline, it can also impose penalties of up to four times the outstanding amount.IRAS added that the time frame does not matter and that audits can be conducted on any past cases or transactions.On the distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion, it said that the former \"normally involves an arrangement that is artificial, contrived or has little or no commercial substance and is designed to obtain a tax advantage that is not intended by the government\".Tax evasion is a criminal offence. IRAS gave the example ofsomeone deliberately providing inaccurate or incomplete information about their activities to reduce their tax liability.Professor Kelvin Low from the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Law said that while \"not all 99-to-1 tenancy in common shareholding structures are shams\", the cases that IRAS is looking into have raised eyebrows.\"Based on blog posts and YouTube videos, it appears that the 99-to-1 holding structure was initially intended for the initial purchase by a couple of their first private property,\" he said.However, for the cases in the IRAS probe, it is \"strongly arguable that the 99-to-1 shareholding structure was intended from the outset, making the initial 100 per cent ownership intermediate transaction simply a sham\" to avoid paying ABSD, said Prof Low.\"Based on media reports, these persons (the initial buyer) are typically unable to purchase the property because they would not be able to meet the TDSR rules put in place by MAS and borrow sufficient funds for the purchase. In other words, the participation of the other 1 per cent co-owner was always necessary for the purchase.\"This makes it very difficult to argue that the initial transfer to the eventual 99 per cent co-owner of 100 per cent of the property was not a sham.\"TDSR, or total debt servicing ratio, refers to the maximum proportion of a person's gross monthly income that goes towards repaying monthly debt obligations.According to tax specialist Vincent Ooi, there are two ways taxpayers can possibly get into trouble with a 99-to-1 arrangement if they entered into it to avoid stamp duties and if they understamp, which means they did not pay the correct amount of duty.Tax avoidance is when an arrangement has the effect of giving a person a tax advantage and the arrangement is entered into without bona fide commercial reasons, said Mr Ooi, who is also a lecturer at Singapore Management Universitys (SMU) Yong Pung How School of Law.In the case of tax avoidance, the correct amount of tax based on the arrangement under the law is paid, but IRAS invokes the general anti-avoidance provision to negate the tax advantage.For cases of understamping, an incorrect amount of tax under the law is paid.For example, if a taxpayer perpetuates a sham to pay less stamp duties, the legal effect of the sham is that it is void, meaning that less tax than the law requires was in fact paid, Mr Ooi said.However, buyers should not fear having to answer IRAS questions as long as their arrangement is defensible and does not count as avoiding tax or understamping, he added.Ms Joanna Yap, managing director of Sabara Law, said that unlike tax evasion, tax avoidance is not a crime.Assuming that the case in question is not one of tax evasion, IRAS, who invoked the tax avoidance provision to recover the shortfall of ABSD, surcharge and interest (if any), will lie as a civil claim against those who took advantage of the scheme, she said.This means that there will not be any criminal sanctions imposed.For those who fail to paythe shortfall of ABSD,IRAS can initiate proceedings such as appointing agents to recover funds, said Ms Yap.On the other hand, fraudulently declaring or withholding information from IRAS is consideredtax evasion an act that is a lot more serious, said SMU's Mr Ooi, adding that offenders face up to three years in jail.He also noted that Singapore makes a distinction between cases of tax avoidance and tax evasion.Under the law, the taxpayer would pay the correct (lower) amount of tax, but the IRAS may invoke the general anti-avoidance rule to negate that tax advantage, he said.In the case of tax evasion, the taxpayer engages in fraudulent activity to pay an incorrect (lower) amount of tax.There is also another possibility those who understamp can also be penalised even though they may not have any fraudulent intent.\"The 99-to-1 split is not a hard and fast rule,\" Mr Ooi said. \"IRAS is likely to audit cases with any proportion of holdings that they think requires probing.\"Property buyers hoping to avoid tax or understamp their assets should not do so, he added.\"If they wish to engage in a 99-to-1 split arrangement for bona fide commercial reasons, they should clearly document their reasons for doing so,\" he said.\"IRAS has enacted targeted anti-avoidance rules to deter tax avoidance on numerous occasions in the past. Moving forward, it may well do so in the present case as well.\"Those who are involved in such arrangements should take the opportunity to make a voluntary disclosure as soon as possible before their case is picked up for an audit, said Ms Yap.As the ABSD was introduced in 2011, there is a possibility that cases dating back over a decade could be uncovered.With the announcement that IRAS is probing the (99-to-1) scheme, it is quite clear that IRAS is expecting those involved to make a voluntary disclosure,\" she added.If no voluntary disclosure is made, then it would be a case of when or if ever the case will be uncovered by IRAS, given that there is no time bar.\"However, she pointed out that lawyers who helped buyers enter into such arrangements currently fall outside the purview of IRAS.Mr Ooi said the lawyers may have also \"expressly declined to advise on such matters or limited their liability for their advice\".Ms Yap said options for those who are already involved in the 99-to-1 scheme are very limited those who have been picked up for audit will need to resolve it with IRAS, while those who are yet to be picked should consider voluntary disclosure.Those who can demonstrate that there were bona fide commercial reasons and the main purpose of entering the scheme was not to avoid or reduce ABSD should be prepared to defend their position against IRAS, she said.Mr Ooi added: \"Clearly such audits have currently become a priority and we can expect the frequency of audits to go up considerably.\"Ms Yap also said that it is not possible to unravel the arrangement and that selling the property does not absolve parties of their obligations to pay the stamp duty.The IRAS probe means that the loophole is generally no longer available, Ms Yap said. Any declaration of 99-to-1 sharing at the exercise option or as per the scheme will cause IRAS to raise its eyebrows. If there are indeed legitimate reasons for doing so, then such reasons should be properly documented and made available to IRAS when the occasion calls for it."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Of these, only 20 totalling $3.57 billion were sold a far cry from the more than $10 billion in deals done from 2017 to 2018.This year, 14 projects with a total value of over $5 billion were launched for sale en bloc before the April 27 cooling measures. Three projects Meyer Park, Bagnall Court and Holland Tower totalling $583.76 million have been sold, JLL said.JLL said getting the mandatory 80 per cent consensus for prime freehold residential projects will be even more of an uphill task and probably impossible to achieve for those that have a very high proportion of foreign owner-occupiers. Typically, prime-district developments have a higher proportion of foreign owner-occupiers, who may now be less incentivised to join a collective sale because the cost of a replacement property is now very much higher for this group, said Mr Tan Hong Boon, executive director of capital markets at JLL.The new curbs include 3 to 30 percentage point hikes in additional buyers stamp duty(ABSD) rates. The steepest increase was targeted at foreigners, with ABSD rates doubling to 60 per cent from 30 per cent.This could strangle the supply of prime collective sale sites near the city centre, especially freehold sites, Mr Tan said.But collective sale projects in the suburbs and city fringe may not be as badly affected, as these cater more to the owner-occupier market, analysts said. Collective sale sites in areas where new residential launches are doing well may continue to attract developers interest if priced realistically, Ms Chia said. For developers, three rounds of cooling measures since December 2021, a weaker macroeconomic outlook and record high interest rates pose major challenges for land banking. Back in 2018, the July 6 round of cooling measures doused the then booming collective sale cycle. Those curbs included a 5 to 10 percentage point increase in ABSD rates for all buyers and developers, as well as an additional 5 per cent non-remittable ABSD on developers.For the current cycle, developers were still grappling with the Dec 15, 2021, round of curbs, which saw ABSD raised to up to 40 per cent for developers that fail to sell all their units within five years, CBREs head of research for South-east Asia Tricia Song said. They became even more cautious in land banking after another round of curbs in September 2022, coupled with higher interest rates and fears of an economic slowdown, she noted. Heightened development risks, higher construction costs and recent revisions in the definitions of gross floor area, which affect a projects saleable area, will also lower the prices developers are prepared to pay for collective sale sites, analysts said. At the same time, many collective sale sellers are less motivated as new and resale private home prices have jumped, resulting in higher replacement costs. Those who own more than one residential property also have to pay higher ABSD, said Mr Michael Tay, CBREs head of capital markets in Singapore.Many residential and non-residential collective sales will remain unsuccessful, JLLs Mr Tan said, noting that many have not managed to get the 80 per cent mandate. For those that got the mandate and launched, some will likely fail due to over-pricing. Analysts said residential collective sale sites priced below $500 million are generally more palatable.Ms Chia noted that the successful residential collective sales since 2022 were generally priced at not more than $260 million, except for the sale of Meyer Park at $392.18 million and Chuan Parks $890 million sale to Kingsford Development and MCC Land. But the Chuan Park sale is in limbo, pending the High Courts decision following objections from some owners. Most of the residential sites sold in this cycle were in the suburban areas, she added.Cushman & Wakefields head of research Wong Xian Yang said smaller projects with a reserve price of less than $100 million have been more successful. From 2021 till now, 18 of 29 commercial and residential collective sales (62 per cent) were below $200 million, he noted.Mr Tay said developers are wary of committing to larger land sites priced at $500 million and above, owing to greater development risks. Prime district collective sale sites are also seeing a lower success rate due to higher unsold new home supply, compared with other sub-markets.Ultimately, for a collective sale to succeed, Ms Chia said sellers must have reasonable price expectations, and developers must appreciate that replacement costs for sellers have increased substantially.With unsold new home supply at a five-year low, many developers may continue to favour Government Land Sales (GLS) for land banking, given the challenges in the collective sale market. Some analysts foresee developers triggering more sites on the GLS reserve list, if there is demand that the collective sale market cannot satisfy.In the medium term, developers may favour sites located in the suburbs and city fringe, and even leasehold sites, over prime and freehold locations, as these are generally more affordable and cater more to the owner-occupier market, Mr Tay said.Of the seven sites on the GLS confirmed list, four are in the city fringe and the rest in the suburbs.Mr Wong also sees developers favouring more suburban and city fringe sites, although he believes they may continue to bid for sites with higher foreign investor exposure. But their site selection criteria in terms of pricing, location and site attributes are expected to tighten further, he said.Ms Tracy Goh, head of investment and collective sales at PropNex, said the strong take-up at new 99-year leasehold launches Tembusu Grand and Blossoms by the Park shows that developers can get good sites from the GLS programme. Developers are very much in control of the timeline when they buy a GLS site, which may be more affordable thancollective salesites, she noted. The reserve price for a state land parcel is at 85 per cent of the Chief Valuers estimated market value for the site, while the reserve price for a collective sale site is typically at a premium over recent transacted prices, Ms Goh said. But Ms Chia warned that developers were already showing signs of defensiveness, even before the latest cooling measures. Only one bid was submitted for the Lentor Gardens GLS tender in early April at a land rate of $985 per sq ft per plot ratio (ppr) the lowest land rate for such tenders in the area and the first time the awarded price was below $1,000 psf ppr, she said.She expects bidding to be more subdued, with more developers adopting a wait-and-see approach, unless the site is in a popular growth location."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This is a rise of 26 per cent from 4,090 residential units in the first half of 2023. With this latest ramp-up, the total confirmed list supply of around 9,250 units for the whole of 2023 will be the highest since 2013, when 12,895 units were announced. This is also nearly 50 per cent higher than the supply in 2022, and around 2 times the supply in 2021.It shows the Governments determination to address the existing market imbalance, where demand for private housing continues to be robust, but supply remains on the catch-up, said Ms Chia Siew Chuin, JLLs head of residential research, research and consultancy.Cushman & Wakefield head of research Wong Xian Yang said the latest injection may not have an immediate impact on prices, as potential new launches may hit the market only in 2025. Nonetheless, the continued ramp-up of supply in the confirmed list signals the Governments intent to cool price growth. Barring a deterioration in economic conditions, we can expect another increase in GLS confirmed list supply in 2024, he added.Four of the eight confirmed list sites are newly introduced Orchard Boulevard, two plots in Upper Thomson Road, and a land parcel in Zion Road (parcel A). Another four of nine reserve list sites are new Holland Drive, De Souza Avenue, Tampines Street 95 (EC), and Zion Road (parcel B), according to PropNex.Analysts noted that about half of the confirmed list supply is in thesuburbs, where local demand remains buoyant. Of the suburban sites, the Clementi Avenue 1 site wedged between Clavon and The Clement Canopy will be appealing given its location and proximity to numerous schools, said PropNex Realty chief executive Ismail Gafoor.By offering sites adjacent to each other or near existing supply (for example, in Zion Road, Upper Thomson Road, Pine Grove, and Plantation Close), it is hoped that the competing supply of homes in these locales will help moderate land bids, he said.Mr Lam Chern Woon, head of research and consulting at Edmund Tie, noted that except for one site next to Orchard Boulevard, the other sites could each yield at least 500 units.The choice of the prime sites was carefully calibrated to ensure that supply is not excessive. The Orchard Boulevard and Zion Road sites are attractive, given their proximity to MRT stations on the Thomson-East Coast Line, Mr Lam said.Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, said that despite the latest cooling measures crimping demand from foreigners for prime district property, the Orchard Boulevard site is deemed a trophy due to its rarity. There has not been a GLS released for sale in this area in the past five years. The last GLS site released was in Cuscaden Road now Cuscaden Reserve. That site attracted nine bidders then and the winning bid was $2,377.2 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr) in May 2018. Moreover, few new developments in the Orchard area are directly linked to an MRT station, she added.The future condominium may be marketed as a super-luxury project, said Ms Sun.On the Zion Road parcels, Mr Lam noted that although these could yield 1,560 residential units, we expect strong end-user demand, given its location and proximity to Great World City and Great World MRT station.JLLs Ms Chia said the capital outlay for Zion Road parcel A could be substantial, and the estimated land cost is $1.52 billion, or $1,670 psf ppr. This confirmed list site is likely to encourage joint ventures between two to three developers, she added.While the site could attract healthy interest, Ms Sun notedthat the future project may not enjoy views of the Singapore River as the units may be blocked by nearby buildings.Just opposite this area is the former GLS site in Jiak Kim Street the current Riviere. There were 10 bidders then and the winning bid was $1,732.54 psf ppr awarded in December 2017, she said. Huttons Asia senior director of research Lee Sze Teck noted that several of the confirmed list sites are near MRT stations or in locations where there had not been any new supply for years.It has been eight years since the last GLS for private housing in Lorong 1 Toa Payoh. With five-room flats at The Peak @ Toa Payoh exceeding $1 million... there is a sizeable pool of Housing Board upgraders. The top bid could be more than $1,200 psf ppr, he said.The Government has also made available for developers to trigger for sale, reserve list sites that can yield an additional 3,430 units (including 855 EC units), 93,350 sq m GFA of commercial space and 530 hotel rooms.The reserve list comprises six private residential sites (including two EC sites), one commercial site, one white site and one hotel site. Mr Lam noted that the Holland Drive site, located near the Holland Village MRT station, will ride on the rejuvenation of the Holland Village precinct by the One Holland Village project.Among the suburban sites, he noted that those in Clementi Avenue 1, Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and De Souza Avenue, where previously launched projects have been fully sold, could draw robust bidding from developers. In particular, for the De Souza site, we could expect interest from residents looking to right-size from the landed housing estates in the Toh Tuck and Upper Bukit Timah precincts, he said.Among the reserve list sites, the Tampines Street 95 (EC) site is most likely to be triggered, Cushmans Mr Wong said.EC demand in the east remains strong, given the strong take-up of Tenet, which is already almost sold out. Given higher private residential prices and an uncertain market outlook, ECs can be a sweet spot for owner-occupiers, he added.Collectively, the latest ramp-up will take the total pipeline supply of private housing (including ECs) to about 63,500 units, comprising 50,200 units with planning approval and 13,300 units from GLS sites and awarded collective sale sites that have yet to be granted planning approval. Of these, about 40,400 units will be completed between 2023 and 2025, which is more than double the 20,000 units completed from 2020 to 2022. This forms part of the total supply of about 100,000 public and private housing units to be completed between 2023 and 2025. But the Government continues to apply a light touch on commercial and hotel supply, preferring to place the bulk of supply under the reserve list.Among the reserve list sites is the white site for a mixed-use development in Woodlands Avenue 2 and the short-term lease commercial site in Punggol Walk. Also included is a site in River Valley Road carried over from the first half 2023 reserve list, for the potential development of more hotel rooms.Correction note: The story has been edited for accuracy."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The Champions Way site, which can yield about 350 units, is launched for sale under the confirmed list. The tender will close at noon on Sept 12. The Lorong 1 Toa Payoh site can yield 775 residential units. The mature estate site, which comes under the reserve list, will be triggered for sale only if a developer submits an acceptable offer in the tender.Huttons senior director of research Lee Sze Teck believes the Lorong 1 Toa Payoh site, which has not seen a private residential land tender since 2015, stands a high chance of being triggered for sale. There is a sizeable pool of HDB upgraders, he noted, given that some five-room flats at The Peak @ Toa Payoh have sold for over $1 million and quite a number of flats across the country just reached minimum occupation period and sold for more than $800,000.The last GLS site awarded in the area was the Lorong 6 Toa Payoh/Lorong 4 Toa Payoh plot (now Gem Residences). It was sold in June 2015 for $345.86 million ($755 per sq ft per plot ratio or psf ppr).Mr Nicholas Mak, chief research officer of property portal Mogul.sg, said the site isarguably the most attractively located (residential) site in the reserve list of the current GLS Programme.If launched for sale, it could attract eight to 13 bids from developers, with the top bid ranging between $800 million and $888 million, which will translate to a land rate of $1,124 to $1,248 psf ppr, he said.Champions Way is the first GLS in Woodlands since 2011, noted Mr Justin Quek, deputy chief executive of OrangeTee & Tie. The previous GLS was for the Woodlands Avenue 2/Rosewood Drive site (now Parc Rosewood), which was sold for $151.5 million ($367 psf ppr) in June 2011, while the previous executive condominium plot in Woodlands was sold in 2015.Located near Woodlands South MRT Station, the future Champions Way project could attract buyers who want to tap the growth of Woodlands Regional Centre in northern Singapores largest economic hub. The site, which is near the upcoming Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System, could also attract tenants who are expatriates and employment pass holders from Malaysia, Mr Quek said.ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim noted that the potential toll from the latest round of cooling measures is minimised as the future suburban project will likely attract local owner-occupiers rather than investors and foreigners.Analysts say the Champions Way site could fetch bids ranging from $920 to $1,012 psf ppr, which would translate to between $300 million and $330 million. This tender could attract five to eight bids.To support decentralisation and bring jobs closer to homes, the Urban Redevelopment Authority has also put up for application on the reserve list a 30-year leasehold commercial site in Punggol Walk with a potential yield of about 8,400 sq m of office space. PropNex Realtys head of research and content Wong Siew Ying believes the site could draw interest due to a lack of commercial office space in the area. The future commercial development may support the Punggol Digital District, attracting occupiers who want to be located in Punggol, she said.About 60 per cent (minimum of 8,400 sq m) of the gross floor area will be required for office use, and at least 650 sq m set aside for a childcare centre. The remaining space could be for retail use, she said.Mr Mak believes the Punggol Walk commercial site is an experiment to test if the market is ready for such a product at Punggol.Even though the site is next to Punggol MRT station, that does not guarantee that a developer would trigger it to be released for tender because Punggol is an untested office market, he said.This is because there is ample supply of office space in other parts of Singapore, with an overall vacancy rate of about 11 per cent, Mr Mak added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

They add up to about 170,000 sq ft of space in HDB shops, shophouses and low-rise commercial blocks, and the portfolio has full occupancy. About 80 per cent of the space is leased to FairPrice, which is set to keep its long-term tenancies in the properties.The properties are in locations such as Bukit Merah Central, Kallang Bahru, Bishan, Hougang, Serangoon North, Holland Drive, Tampines, Bedok, Buona Vista, Clementi, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East and Jurong West.The balance tenures for the properties vary, but average at around 57 years.Word in the market is that the 18 properties have been split into three bundles; prospective buyers may submit offers for individual bundles, or the whole portfolio.Mr Clemence Lee, executive director of capital markets for Singapore at CBRE, said: Mercatus is exploring a sale of a portion of its assets via an expression of interest exercise. CBRE has been appointed as the agent.He confirmed that the assets would be sold with existing long-term tenancies in place, but said that we are unable to disclose details of the portfolio due to commercial sensitivities.There is no certainty or assurance that this exercise will lead to a transaction and we cannot speculate on the outcome of the exercise, he added.A spokesman for Mercatus said it regularly reviews its portfolio to deliver greater social impact and generate long-term sustainable returns for its stakeholders.For now, it is business as usual and Mercatus remains committed to safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders, including its tenants and their customers, it added.Over the past nine months, Mercatus has sold a chunk of its Singapore retail assets for a total of slightly more than $3 billion.In late December 2022, it entered a deal to sell Jurong Point and Swing By @ Thomson Plaza to Hong Kong-listed Link Real Estate Investment Trust for $2.16 billion.In late January 2023, it struck a deal to sell its half stake in Nex mall in Serangoon Central to Frasers Centrepoint Trust and Frasers Property that valued the prime suburban mall (100 per cent interest) at $2.08 billion.Market watchers noted that the 18 properties being offered via expression of interest are in mature HDB estates, with a captive catchment of heartlanders shopping for daily necessities.The assets may appeal to prospective investors focused on stable income with built-in rental increases.The smallest property is a 797 sq ft first-floor shop unit in Hougang Avenue 3 occupied by a Cheers outlet. This is the convenience retail format of FairPrice. The other 17 properties are anchored by FairPrice supermarkets. FairPrice is part of the FairPrice Group, which comprises FairPrice, NTUC Foodfare, Kopitiam and NTUC Link.Among the more centrally located assets is a space of about 30,700 sq ft at 71 Kallang Bahru, a two-storey commercial block a stones throw from Geylang Bahru MRT station. Besides a FairPrice supermarket that occupies the bulk of this space, there are some shops on the first floor.Another sizeable asset, of about 45,000 sq ft, is in a three-storey commercial block at 510 Bishan Street 13, about 100m from Bishan Bus Interchange and MRT station. FairPrice occupies about 21,000 sq ft of this space; Mercatus also has other tenants for this asset.Both these properties have potential for enhancement in value, for instance, by reconfiguring and repositioning some areas to cater to tenants that can pay higher rents.Other assets among the portfolio of 18 that are in HDB commercial blocks include the FairPrice supermarket spaces of about 13,500 sq ft at Block 166 Bukit Merah Central and 10,000-plus sq ft at Block 114 Aljunied Avenue 2.First-floor HDB shops owned by Mercatus that are among the 18 assets earmarked for sale include a 7,000-plus sq ft unit in Holland Drive and a 6,200 sq ft unit in Bedok Reservoir Road.There is also a 13,000 sq ft corner first-floor shop at Block 135 Jurong Gateway Road near Jurong East MRT stationThe NTUC Enterprise group of social enterprises are: FairPrice Group, NTUC First Campus, NTUC Health, Income Insurance, NTUC LearningHub, Mercatus and MoneyOwl, which is shutting by the end of 2023.

Office values have tumbled 31 per cent from a peak in March 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, according to property analytics firm Green Street.Concerns are mounting that defaults will increase as property values fall and costs rise for landlords who need to refinance at higher interest rates.Over-leveraged owners are often more motivated to stop payments than sink money into buildings with diminished prospects for returns. Blackstone, Brookfield and Goldman Sachs Group are among investors that have defaulted or relinquished offices to lenders in 2023. Theyre going to have every incentive to hand back the keys to lenders, Mr David Bitner, global head of research at Newmark, said in an interview. Im shocked that hasnt happened a lot more.Newmark defines potentially troubled as properties where debt represents at least 80 per cent of the real estates marked-to-market value, based on price indexes including Green Streets.Banks, which have tightened lending since this years collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, carry the biggest share of at-risk debt, with US$303 billion of potentially troubled loans maturing through 2025, according to Newmark.After offices, apartment buildings are the next biggest category of potentially troubled properties, with US$192 billion in debt needing to be refinanced through 2025, Newmark estimates.Landlords who try to hang on and weather the storm are likely to take a bigger hit than those who cut their losses more quickly, according to Mr Bitner.

Rising prices also make real estate an attractive and safe avenue. In addition, large sums of money are involved in a single transaction. Ms Gazalle Mok, a partner at Rajah & Tann Singapores corporate real estate practice, told The Straits Times that money laundering is a process of masking illegitimate funds so that they appear to originate from legitimate sources. The use of sophisticated means to place illegitimate funds into the economy and creating layers of transactions using different bank accounts and passports make it even more difficult to detect such criminal conduct, she said.Ms Mok added that the effectiveness of due diligence checks is also largely dependent on the accuracy of declarations by buyers and the verification documents provided. It is very difficult for lay persons to detect whether these are fake or forged.Mr Dennis Miralis, an Australian lawyer at Nyman Gibson Miralis who is familiar with cross-border crimes, said real estate is a very prevalent form of money laundering across the globe. Apart from real estate, illicit funds are often used to buy luxury assets and invest in businesses. They can also be used in gaming machines and to buy casino chips, which are later encashed.Professionals such as lawyers, accountants and real estate agents may knowingly or unknowingly help criminals to launder money through real estate by setting up and maintaining domestic or offshore trusts and companies.They could also facilitate transactions on behalf of the criminal by receiving and transferring large amounts of cash, setting up complex loans and other credit arrangements, and facilitating the transfer of properties to third parties.All you need is someone who knows the law and accounting to help set up a webof companies to own 105 properties, and ideally link the proceeds back to an offshore account or tax haven, said a property consultant who did not want to be identified.He was referring to the case in which 10 foreign nationals, aged between 31 and 44, were charged this week for alleged money-laundering and forgery offences, with police seizing about $1 billion worth of assets, including luxury homes, cars and cash, in one of Singapores biggest anti-money laundering probes. All of those caught are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents.Prohibition of disposal orders were issued against 105 properties, with a total estimated value of $831 million. The items seized included more than 35 related bank accounts, more than 250 luxury bags and watches, more than 270 pieces of jewellery and documents with information on virtual assets.Accountants, real estate agents and solicitors who are involved in the property sector will increasingly need to play a front-line role in protecting and defending the real estate market from criminal exploitation. It is not possible for the police to arrest their way out of this problem. It genuinely requires a whole-of-society approach, said Mr Miralis.On June 28, Singapore introduced onerous rules requiring developers to perform risk analysis, carry out customer due diligence checks, report suspicious transactions and implement programmes to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing for properties under construction. This includes ongoing monitoring of the purchasers throughout the whole construction period until legal completion, which usually takes about three years to five years to complete, Ms Mok said. She noted, however, that there are non-property developers and individuals not governed under the Housing Developers (Control and Licencing) Act or the Sale of Commercial Properties Act, and they may not have the resources or capacity to conduct due diligence checks on buyers.Perhaps some form of governance should also be imposed on all vendors, not only property developers, to require due diligence checks on their purchasers and third-party payers to be cleared before options are issued, or sale and purchase agreements are entered into. Perhaps real estate agents can play a role in this aspect to conduct due diligence checks for their customers, Ms Mok said.Developers who fail to comply with the new requirements may be guilty of an offence and can be fined up to $100,000. They may also face suspension or revocation of any licence that has been granted to them if found guilty of a money-laundering or terror-funding offence.Lawyers shared with ST the different ways dirty money could be laundered through the property market:Criminals often buy properties using the name of someone who is not on the police radar or a local person to avoid direct involvement in the money-laundering process. The property may be held in trust for the criminal.Criminals may buy property under a third partys name and pay that third party rent using illicit funds. By renting their property through a third party, criminals can disguise illicit funds and ownership.They can also lease out their properties and provide tenants with illicit funds to cover the rental to legitimise the illicit funds.Criminals use illicit funds to pay for renovations, thereby increasing the value of the property, which is then sold at a higher price.Criminals may set up front companies, shell companies, trusts and other company structures in Singapore or overseas to buy properties and distance themselves from ownership.Criminals can collude with third parties, such as property agents, to under- or overestimate the value of a property. The difference is settled with undisclosed cash payments. When a property is undervalued, the criminal (buyer) can claim that the amount paid in the contract is consistent with his legitimate financial means. If the property was sold at the market value or higher, the profit would serve to legitimise the illicit funds. This method is also used to pay less stamp duty.Criminals may overvalue a property to obtain the largest possible loan from a lender. The larger the loan, the greater the amount of illicit funds that can be laundered to service the debt.Some open accounts with banks to take up funding. But within a year, they pay up the loan in cash, said a lawyer, highlighting how this could be a red flag.Loans and mortgages can be used as a cover for laundering the proceeds of crime, and their repayment can be used to mix illicit with legitimate funds.To further confuse the audit trail, criminals may seek to resell a property in quick succession.The property is sold at a higher value, either to related or acquainted third parties, or to companies or trusts controlled by the criminal. This gives an appearance of seemingly legitimate profits while the criminal maintains control over the property.Those who want to avoid triggering any suspicion or alerts may deposit small amounts of cash across different banks and avoid triggering threshold transaction reports. The funds are then used to obtain bank cheques to buy properties.Criminals may use multiple professionals to further complicate the money-laundering process to avoid detection. This provides a veneer of legitimacy to criminal activity and a buffer between criminals and their financial activities and assets.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

It is the first mega residential development in the highly sought-after Dakota area, with 1,008 units and five commercial shops spread across seven spacious towers.Following its official launch on Jul 15, Grand Dunman developers SingHaiyi Group and CSC Land Group sold approximately 550 units over two days with an average price of $2,500 per sq ft.The allure of the Dakota neighbourhood in District 15 lies in how it is close to the city, especially the CBD and Marina Bay areas, as well as the Greater Southern Waterfront areas, as well as the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and East Coast Parkway (ECP).But unlike Katong and Siglap which are further down the road, the Dakota area is nearer iconic landmarks like the Singapore Sports Hub, Suntec City and Marina Bay Sands. At the same time, it keeps you away from the hustle and bustle as it is also a short drive to East Coast Park where the sea awaits.Heres more proof of Grand Dunmans accessible location: A two-minute walk takes residents to Dakota MRT station where the Circle Line connects to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT interchange in minutes and brings you all over Singapore quickly and easily.But even so, the mega projects developers SingHaiyi Group and CSC Land Group have thoughtfully allocated one carpark lot to every residential unit, a rarity in the market today due to space limitations in newer developments.This generous commitment to providing ample parking space is an example of their unwavering focus on enhancing the lifestyle experience for residents.They have also allocated one per cent of the gross floor area for indoor facilities to give homeowners sufficient recreational space for a healthy lifestyle in a vibrant community.This is also why there are more than 40 facilities throughout the project, including an 80m Grand Pool, two clubhouses, hydro massage facilities and a Tree House-concept playground.For more recreational time with your family, the condo offers easy access to the Park Connector Network extension which takes you on bicycle or foot to the Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade, East Coast Park and the future Long Island, slated to be a reclaimed island along the south-eastern coast stretching from Marina East to Changi.And after all that working out, fuel up at the popular Old Airport Road Food Centre as well as the vibrant Katong and Joo Chiat enclaves, and the Paya Lebar district with its popular malls like PLQ Mall. If you have young children, Grand Dunman is within 1km to popular schools like Kong Hwa School and it is also near Chung Cheng High (Main), Dunman High and Tanjong Katong Primary School.Design-wise, Grand Dunman is all about quality and grandeur without looking loud and overly extravagant. Six luxury stacks will be designed in silver with one Grand Block in champagne gold, housing the premium units.The seven majestic towers allow most units to enjoy a breathtaking view of the city or an unobstructed, tranquil vista of the neighbouring landed homes. Some units will even offer pocket sea views.To elevate the living experience, the theme of grandeur extends all the way indoors into the fixtures and appliances that come with your home.The developers have specially curated premium fitting brands such as De Dietrich, Gessi, Kohler and Miele. Letting you decompress in a comforting yet sophisticated ambience after a tiring day.Know your property developers track recordMany people find house hunting to be a daunting task, especially when it comes to sussing out the track records of property developers and builders.To make things easier for the home buyer, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) developed a new banding system for its Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) in May. This provides home buyers with information on the performance of property developers and builders, based on their track record of private residential projects for the past six years.Under this new banding system, developer SingHaiyi Group and CSC Land Group, which are behind Grand Dunman, have scored Band 1. This top rating is awarded to property developers that have consistently delivered projects with no or very low incidences of major defects.

Within this market lies a niche segment strata office spaces where demand and prices have recently run up. In a strata-titled office building, usable space is subdivided into individual office units, and sold by the developer to users or investors, much like condominiums in Singapore. Strata offices allow small and medium-sized businesses to own office space without the need to purchase an entire building, and can offer various advantages that include cost savings, flexibility, and the opportunity for ownership and investment potential.In Singapore, an estimated 14.6 million square feet or 16.6 per cent of the total available office stock is strata-titled. The bulk of that more than 55 per cent is in the Central Business District (CBD), the Downtown Core and Orchard Planning Areas. These strata-titled offices come in a variety of central locations, age and quality. However, due to the fragmented ownership structure, such buildings can face challenges in maintenance and upkeep, at times resulting in varying degrees of physical deterioration and a poor and disharmonious tenant mix.As Singapore matured into a business hub over time, established developers and investment institutions shifted their strategy towards holding entire office buildings for recurring rental income, preferring that over subdividing for strata-titled sales. Since Centrium Square and Woods Square were launched for sale in 2016, there were no other new strata-titled office projects until late 2022. Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Furthermore, the Urban Redevelopment Authority announced in March 2022 strata subdivision of commercial developments into individual units would no longer be allowed in specific areas in the Orchard Road and CBD corridors, and near national landmarks around the Padang. With this move by the government to ensure the upkeep and quality of commercial buildings, there will be even less new strata-titled office inventory in the future. There is evidence of demand for such properties. The launch and sale of units at Solitaire on Cecil from end-2022 spurred a substantial amount of transaction activity. All units were sold, recording an average unit price of S$4,186 per square foot (psf). This reflected pent-up demand and a total transaction value of about S$478.3 million (based on caveats that were lodged) for new bite-sized freehold office assets of investment quality in a CBD location a niche office product that had been absent from the market for several years. From 2015 to 2023 (year to date), the annual number of strata-titled office units transacted was typically under 400 units. This was likely because no new strata-titled office units were introduced into the larger market. This already-thin volume was made worse by the Covid-19 outbreak, which hit all aspects of the economy in 2020. The period from 2012 to 2022 was the lowest point for the strata office market, when little over 200 transactions were recorded at an average unit price of S$2,268 psf.The strata-titled office market picked up from 2021. Average unit prices increased steadily from S$2,277 psf in 2021 to S$2,553 psf in 2022. From Jan 1 to Aug 4, 2023, average unit prices rose further to S$3,135 psf, defying gravity in a time of economic uncertainty. Apart from the strong take-up at Solitaire on Cecil, transactions in existing quality strata-titled office buildings in the CBD also contributed to the upward movement in prices. For example, the average unit price for Suntec City in 2023 year to date was S$3,088 psf, an increase of 18.4 per cent from the S$2,608 psf for the whole of 2021. In 2021 and 2022, the average unit price at Samsung Hub rose above the S$4,000 psf level, from under S$4,000 psf before and during the pandemic. Actual demand for strata-titled office space may also be understated, as not all transactions that took place were caveated or reported. Solitaire on Cecil was reported to be sold out, even though not all transactions were captured, due to some buyers and/or investors keeping a low profile and information on their purchases private. What are some reasons that might drive a decision by firms and businesses to acquire strata-titled office space instead of leasing? One is that buying their own space would give them a hedge against rising office rents, which in turn makes for a more predictable cash flow and greater control over the operational flexibility of the unit. With the current economic headwinds, ownership of a strata-titled office unit can be beneficial to certain small and medium-sized firms and businesses, as they can rent out unutilised space for supplementary income. They can also pivot quickly, based on business needs. Buyers and investors such as family businesses are also likely to be attracted to freehold strata-titled office units for potential capital preservation and appreciation that serve longer-term financial goals.There is evidently demand due to the increasing rarity of strata-titled space in the market, especially for freehold or longer tenure commercial sites in the Downtown Core Planning Area. If developers are able to snag such plots to add to their land bank, they can expect niche, but firm, demand for new builds.Despite the demand for this niche investment commercial property, the challenges inherent in a strata-titled commercial building remain, and buyers should be mindful of possible drawbacks. Ownership of multiple units within the same office building will challenge the standards of upkeep by the management corporations, especially as the building ages. But a poorly-managed building is in no way a forgone conclusion. Many residential condominium projects have been able to maintain quality over time. There are also examples of strata-titled office buildings that have maintained quality. In turn, they have been able to keep if not enhance their respective values over an investment horizon. Strata-titled office buildings might just provide the unique office solution that meets the considerations of occupier space requirements, investment potential and the need to rightsize in a tech-enabled, post-pandemic world.

Among other things, landlords will be barred from using rental formulas that change during the lease, and from including clauses in their contracts to make their tenants pay for unspecified costs. The Lease Agreements for Retail Premises Bill, which was first introduced in Parliament on July 4 and passed on Thursday, will make compliance with the code of conduct for the leasing of retail premises in Singapore mandatory. These premises include eateries, clinics, pet shops, tuition centres and gyms. Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling said the code provides tenants and landlords with greater clarity on industry norms for key terms in retail lease agreements. This makes the negotiation process more transparent for both parties and addresses the tenants concerns over imbalances in bargaining power, she told Parliament.However, this does not signal a shift in the Governments position on free market principles, she said, in response to points raised by Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten) and Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok) during the debate on the Bill.The Governments underlying philosophy has always been and still is, in the words of then Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah in 2018, that free market principles should apply, and the Government should only intervene where necessary, said Ms Low, adding that the Bill does not seek to intervene in market outcomes or distort competition or market forces at work.She said: We recognise the potential downsides of over-regulating in the lease negotiations space where market forces and commercial considerations should prevail.Mr Lim had expressed concern about Parliament being asked to legislate matters which ought to be determined by market forces. He also cautioned that recommendations in the code may tilt too much towards protecting tenants if more members of the committee reviewing the code are pro-tenants.Ms Low said that the Bill empowers the industry players in the retail sector to come together to identify, agree on and address key pain points by finding common ground.Besides mandating the guidelines of the code, the Bill formally establishes the Fair Tenancy Industry Committee as a custodian of the code. The committee, which is appointed by the minister for trade and industry, includes representatives from tenants and landlord groups, as well as industry experts. It has three main roles: periodically review and, with the ministers approval, modify the code; monitor and promote compliance by tenants and landlords; and establish the process for submission of declarations of permitted deviations from the codes leasing principles. Four leasing principles under the code can be deviated from if the landlord and the tenant mutually agree.Since June 2021, when the code was introduced, all government landlords and nine major private-sector landlords have voluntarily adopted the code. To give other landlords time to come on board, the Bill will take effect in early February in 2024, covering all new leases, extensions or renewals, said Ms Low.Several MPs asked whether more data could be made available to help tenants make informed decisions about leasing.Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) and Workers Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) asked if data transparency guidelines outlined in the code will be mandated under the Bill. The data transparency guidelines state that landlords who collect sales data from tenants as part of the gross turnover rent structure must share sales data metrics by trade category such as total monthly sales and total floor area on a one-on-one basis before the signing of the lease agreement. Ms Low confirmed that these guidelines would be mandated under the Bill.Other areas covered include prohibiting landlords from profiting from the sale of electricity, and from including exclusivity clauses that restrict tenants from opening another business within a certain radius, except by mutual agreement.Landlords will also not be allowed to include in their agreements sales performance clauses where they can unilaterally terminate a lease if certain sales targets are not met, and they will be allowed to unilaterally pre-terminate leases for redevelopment works only if they fulfil certain conditions.Some MPs also stressed the need to balance the needs of retailers and landlords.Ms Jessica Tan (East Coast GRC), for example, said that a win-win approach should be taken. If this is achieved, retail businesses can have fair and predictable rents and terms and conditions to allow them to operate in a highly competitive market, while landlords can benefit from the occupancy and continue to invest in the quality of their properties and marketing programmes, she said. The Bill sets out a formal dispute resolution process. The parties will first be required to undergo mediation to resolve the dispute, but if they cannot agree, an adjudicator may be brought in to decide on the dispute. The adjudicator can order the parties to vary the lease agreementor pay compensation, where applicable, for their non-compliant conduct, and this will be enforceable as a court order.Said Ms Low: Im confident that by ensuring fair and balanced lease negotiations, the Bill will strengthen the foundations of the retail market.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

The dust has yet to settle, but some investors are already voicing concerns over how this decision will play out in practice.Up to now, all 42 Reits and trusts listed on the Singapore Exchange have had an external manager. In the United States the worlds largest Reit market most Reits now run on an internal-manager model. Removing the manager and appointing an internal management alternative were the two key resolutions put forward at a contentious extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Monday. The EGM had been requisitioned by activist investor and unit holder Quarz Capital Asia on June 7.Sabana Reits current manager is owned by its sponsor and largest unit holder ESR Capital, which holds a 20.6 per cent stake in the Reit. An internal manager is generally owned by the Reit and its unit holders, while an external manager is owned by a third party, such as the Reits sponsor.The vote to remove the manager was passed with 57.46 per cent in favour and 42.54 per cent against, while the second resolution to appoint an internal manager was approved by a 55.6 per cent majority, with 44.4 per cent in opposition. A key unit holder, Swiss-based conglomerate Volare Group, is believed to have voted in favour of the resolutions. It owns 16.01 per cent of Sabana, while Quarz holds 14.01 per cent. The Straits Times has contacted Volare for comment. Quarz and other critics have argued that an internally managed Sabana Reit would more closely align the interests of the Reit with its investors and prevent serious conflicts of interest. They point to, among other grievances, the managers attempt in 2020 to push through a merger with ESR-Reit (now ESR-Logos Reit) on lowball terms for Sabana Reits unit holders.The manager had countered that internalising the management function is an uncertain and potentially expensive process that could destroy value for unit holders. Sabana Reit may also end up in breach of its loan covenants, it said.One of the benefits of an external Reit manager is its links with the sponsor. This gives the Reit access to a potential property pipeline where it is able to acquire assets from the sponsor. Hong Kong-based ESR said in a statement on Monday afternoon that it was disappointed with the outcome. It said: While the current manager will continue to act as the interim manager, unit holders will have to endure a period of uncertainty about how Sabana Reit will be managed in future, and this will create pressure on the value of Sabana Reit and may call into question its long-term future. ESR said it expects the trustee to quickly appoint appropriate advisers and come up with a comprehensive plan and next steps to safeguard the interests of all unit holders, setting out the timelines and cost estimates for each step in order to minimise the period of uncertainty and any adverse risks in the process of implementinginternalisation.All expenses incurred in this process will be borne by the Reit. Mr David Gerald, chief executiveof the Securities Investors Association (Singapore), or Sias, said: The unit holders have spoken and am sure they have made an informed decision. The question is, whats next? Can the next step, the amendment to the trust deed, be carried through with a 75 per cent vote? Sias is neutral on the options.The EGM was held at New Tech Park in Lorong Chuan, a flagship Sabana Reit property, and lasted for just over an hour. Employees of the Reit manager appeared shocked following the unexpected outcome of the meeting, but Quarz invited them to stay on and work for the new internal manager to build up the business together. With the outgoing manager Sabana Real Estate Investment Management (SREIM) expected to continue with its duties, the next step is for an internalised management structure that does not currently exist to be identified, established and then approved by unit holders. Earlier, the Reits trustee had noted in a July 21 statement that this process could take at least 12 months and involve at least two more EGMs. SREIM had also earlier warned that it cannot guarantee that it can retain its staff, while at least one executive has already resigned.Trading in Sabana Reit units was halted on Monday. The units had closed unchanged at 40.5 cents last Friday."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Year to date, rent reversion for CICTs office portfolio grew 9.6 per cent, outpacing that of its retail portfolio, which recorded a 6.9 per cent growth. Its office portfolios occupancy rate rose quarter on quarter, marginally improving from 94.8 per cent to 95.4 per cent. Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.WeWork was one of CICTs top 10 tenants for the month of June, with 2.4 per cent of total gross rent contributing to CICTs total gross rental income. The Singapore central business district (CBD) was CICTs second-highest revenue stream (27.7 per cent) for the first half of the year. A recent Knight Frank report that found that businesses in Singapore were not deterred from continuing to seek quality spaces in the CBD, supporting the strong occupancy levels in the office market. CICT echoed that view, seeing healthy demand for its office assets coming from private wealth and asset management companies, law firms, professional services and government agencies combined with a tighter supply ahead for Singapores CBD expected beyond 2023.Suntec Reits Singapore office portfolio recorded year-on-year growth in both gross revenue and net property income for H1 FY2023 by 8.1 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively, citing higher occupancy and rent at its Suntec City Office and One Raffles Quay. The Reits Singapore office portfolio was near full occupancy as at Jun 30, 2023, with its overall Singapore occupancy at 99.3 per cent and its core CBD occupancy at 94.8 per cent. Its office assets also marked 20 quarters of positive rent reversion and came in at 10.8 per cent for H1 FY2023.Co-working spaces remained a minor portion of Suntec Reits office portfolio at roughly 3 per cent as at Jun 30. WeWork consisted of 1.9 per cent of Suntec Reits total monthly office gross rental income, according to Suntec Reits 2022 annual report.MPACTs Mapletree Business City had 95.9 per cent committed occupancy with 7.1 per cent rental reversion. Year on year, MPACTs gross revenue and net property income for Q1 FY2023/24 were up 75.6 per cent and 68.0 per cent respectively, with its Singapore properties delivering better performance more than offsetting higher utility expenses.The writer is associate director of research at Singapore Exchange (SGX).

Executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng told 600 guests at a dinner celebration at Orchard Hotel Singapore on Tuesday: In the years to come, I would like CDL to have a presence in many parts of the world. I think there are opportunities. Chief executive Sherman Kwek said at the event that expanding across geographies is crucial for the company, which now runs hotels and real estate projects in Australia, China, Japan, Britain and Vietnam. We need to further expand our overseas portfolio so that if there are any market specific disruptions, we wont be overly concentrated in one geography, Mr Kwek said. He added that CDL is also expanding into new asset classes, such as rental apartments, student accommodation and workers dormitories, to grow its core business of developing residential and mixed-use developments as well as hospitality and commercial asset management. These asset classes are also defensive in nature and recession-proof, Mr Kwek said. CDL is also developing its second integrated commercial and residential project in Suzhou despite an ill-fated investment in now-bankrupt Chinese property developer Sincere Property Group. This led to a $1.78 billion impairment on the investment in 2020, resulting in CDL booking a net loss of $1.9 billion for the year.The company sold its stake in Sincere Property Group for US$1 (S$1.35) in September 2021. Mr Kwek said 2020 to 2022 was the most trying period for CDL, noting that the fallout from its sizeable investment in Sincere Property Group made dealing with the impact of Covid-19 on its commercial and hospitality businesses more challenging. Still, CDL has also made moves that have added value for shareholders, such as the 2019 delisting and privatisation of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels from the London Stock Exchange in a deal that valued the hotel chain at 2.23 billion (S$3.8 billion). The firm reported earnings of $66.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 94.1 per cent down on the same period a year earlier. This was mainly due to the absence of significant divestment gains, as well as greater financing costs and impairment losses on its British investment properties. Revenue for the period grew 83.6 per cent year on year to $2.7 billion.The company declared a special interim dividend of four cents a share.CDL shares closed down 0.74 per cent at $6.71 on Wednesday.Correction note: An earlier version of this article said CDL is developing its first integrated commercial and residential project in Suzhou.

There are still hidden gems for savvy buyers to not only enjoy an upscale lifestyle at a great value, but also serve as a wise investment for the years ahead.One such valuable opportunity is The Arden, a new boutique development in Choa Chu Kang, comprising a collection of 105 luxury homes with four facility courtyards. Developed by multi-award-winning developer Qingjian Realty, the development is set to be a head-turner in terms of affordability in the current market of new launches.Because the land was purchased in 2019 at a time when land prices were lower, Propnex Realtys CEO Ismail Gafoor says the developer was able to price units at The Arden attractively today, especially in an environment of rising costs. Current new launch prices in D23 have already hit a benchmark of over $2,000 per square foot, notes CEO of ERA Singapore Marcus Chu. Amidst the current government land sales (GLS) sites, there is still a very limited supply of new developments with entry level price points. With its premium provision and finishes, The Arden truly stands out as the most affordable new launch in 2023 at prices a notch below the suburban launches in the market that suits the buyers budget without compromising on quality and luxury.At the same time, the limited supply of unsold homes in the suburbs and District 23 could push up demand, and therefore prices, further.Huttons CEO Mark Yip estimates that just 2,000 out of the 16,000 unsold private homes available islandwide are in the Outside Central Region (OCR), with just 464 unsold units as at July 21 in District 23.And there are only 3,500 units launching in the OCR this year, out of the 10,000 units throughout Singapore with The Arden being the only project in Choa Chu Kang this year. That points to possible pent-up demand for homes in the Choa Chu Kang neighbourhood.Analysts say these factors set the stage for The Arden to stand out as an attractive option for homeowners in todays landscape while creating even more potential for upside and capital appreciation for homeowners looking to sell years down the road.We expect The Arden to appeal to a diverse group of buyers from families to young professionals as well as those looking to upgrade from their housing board flats, who want a modern home that is close to nature and nestled in a tranquil environment, given its location within a low-density landed property enclave, Mr Ismail Gafoor says.And all that comes at no sacrifice to convenience and accessibility. Just a short walk will take residents to the Phoenix Light Rail Transit (LRT) and Bukit Panjang Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations where they can seamlessly access the rest of the island via the Downtown Line with convenient interchanges along the way to the Circle Line and North-South Line that can take them to neighbourhoods such as Marina Bay, City Hall and Bouna Vista.The Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub is also approximately nine-minutes walk from The Arden, offering a plethora of bus options as well. With Bukit Panjangs close proximity to emerging new neighbourhoods like Tengah Town, Jurong Lake District, Jurong Innovation District and Woodlands Regional Centre, the area could see a rejuvenation in the years ahead, not to mention an easy commute for residents whose workplaces are located in these districts.Closer to home, a variety of amenities also await, offering the convenience of modern-day living. A short walk away from The Arden are three shopping malls Junction 10, Hillion Mall and Bukit Panjang Plaza offering plenty of dining and shopping options. Venture slightly farther and youll also be able to enjoy the wonders of Lot One Shoppers Mall in Choa Chu Kang, the Rail Mall and Cold Storage Dairy Farm.Families with school-going children will appreciate that the neighbourhood is home to schools such as Teck Whye Primary School, West View Primary School, South View Primary School, Bukit Panjang Government High School and Jurong Pioneer JC ensuring a smooth educational journey for the younger ones in the family.Beyond its attractive pricing and enviable location, The Arden, which comprises two- to four- bedroom units, boasts cutting-edge design and smart home solutions guaranteed to add glamour and comfort to your everyday life.The development cuts a striking figure with its modern classic and timeless look. What is breath-taking is also how lush and verdant the landscaping in The Arden is, and thanks to its location on an elevated plain which allowed the developer to maximise the amount of privacy through natural greenery. Moreover, it is also nestled within a private enclave and with a park tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city.With a ceiling height of 3.2 metres higher than that of traditional condominium units each apartment can remain cool and airy throughout the day, providing residents with greater levels of comfort. A bonus for residents is wardrobe heights within each unit are also higher as a result, resulting in even more storage space.The ample storage in each unit extends to the thoughtful addition of dining cabinets for dry kitchens, kitchen-island counters for some units, and display shelving, giving residents a clutter-free and comfortable living space. All apartment units will also be fitted with premium brands such as Bosch, Hansgrohe, and Roca, providing a sense of true luxury in The Arden.The Arden is a home that can evolve with the changing seasons of life, thanks to Qingjian Realtys thoughtful and innovative designs.This comes in the form of Qingjian Realtys trademark CoSpace concept, which allows residents of The Arden to reconfigure rooms within their units to suit their changing needs throughout their lifetimes flexibly and efficiently.Homeowners at The Arden can remove the wall between the study and living area to carve out a special nook in their homes for a piano corner or bar counter, or simply to accommodate a much larger living room to meet the needs of a growing family.With the pandemic having ushered in a new era of hybrid remote working and learning, CoSpace allows residents to create spaces like home offices and study corners and reconfigure them whenever they no longer need those spaces giving homeowners unparalleled flexibility and power to adapt their homes to their changing needs.The versatility of a CoSpace home accommodates unlimited possibilities for homeowners to craft their home just the way they want it, making it a haven to treasure for generations to come.The Arden near the Bukit Panjang MRT station is thoughtfully crafted by CNQC (Phoenix), a subsidiary of Qingjian Realty (South Pacific) Group.

The orders mean they cannot be sold. In all, the total value of assets linked to the case has risen to more than $2.8 billion.Giving an update on the case in a ministerial statement, Ms Indranee said 94 residential properties have been issued with prohibition orders to date, including eight landed homes in Sentosa Cove. Of these, 60 were completed resale units and 34 were uncompleted units sold by developers.Fifty-three commercial properties and five industrial properties have also been issued with prohibition orders.Investigations are ongoing into the property agencies and agents who facilitated the transactions involved in the money laundering probe, Ms Indranee added.We will fully investigate the incident and, if any breaches are found, take the necessary regulatory action.On Workers Party MP He Ting Rus (Sengkang GRC) question on the Governments considerations in allowing foreigners to buy landed homes in Singapore, Ms Indranee noted that there are two approval regimes when it comes to landed property.One is for homes on mainland Singapore, which is much stricter. The other is for residential property on Sentosa Cove, which are developed specifically to market to international clientele, she said. The number of approvals granted under the Residential Property Act remains low, she said. In 2022, 34 approvals were granted to permanent residents (PRs) to own landed residential property on the mainland. In 2021, 51 approvals were granted, and 24 in 2020.In contrast, an average of 2,700 landed property transactions were recorded annually on the mainland over the same period, she added. There are more than 73,000 landed homes in Singapore.Ms He had also asked about the exceptional economic contribution criteria that foreign nationals have to fulfil. The Government takes a very strict approach when granting such approvals, said Ms Indranee, who is also Second Minister for Finance. Applicants must have been a Singapore PR for at least five years and made exceptional economic contributions to Singapore, such as through income tax contributions.Another consideration is whether applicants have a strong Singapore nexus, she added. For example, this would include PRs with children who have served national service and those who have demonstrated strong commitment to Singapore.These factors point towards an applicants connection to Singapore, and their long-term commitment and contribution to Singapore, she said.Ms Indranee said the Singapore Land Authority received 88 applications from foreigners to buy landed properties in Sentosa Cove in the past three years. All but two have been approved, she said in response to Nominated MP Neil Parekh. Approvals are generally granted to foreigners who are not PRs as the islands development was aimed at an international clientele, she added.Ms Indranee reiterated that the eight landed homes issued with prohibition of disposal orders are Sentosa Cove properties, while the rest are non-landed units.None of them are landed homes on the mainland, she said.She noted that there are no restrictions on foreign ownership of non-landed residential homes, since landed residential properties on the mainland have been set aside primarily for Singaporeans.Overall, the proportion of foreign property purchases remains low at about 2 per cent, she said, noting that additional buyers stamp duty rates for foreigners were raised from 30 per cent to 60 per cent in April to dampen local and foreign investment and prioritise Singaporean owner-occupation.Ms Indranee also outlined the measures in place in the property sector to tackle money laundering, noting that they have been progressively strengthened.For instance, the prescribed duties of property agents were legislated in 2021, and anti-money laundering requirements were extended to developers of residential, commercial and industrial properties in 2023.Property agents, agencies and developers are the first line of defence against money laundering in the real estate sector and, as gatekeepers, they have a duty to perform customer due diligence checks on clients, she said.These include verifying the identity of the client or the beneficial owner, screening these parties, assessing their level of risk and maintaining records.Any person who knows or has reasonable grounds to suspect any propertys connection to criminal conduct is required to file a suspicious transaction report, she said. This includes property agents, agencies, developers, landlords and professionals such as conveyancing lawyers, accountants and financial institutions.Conveyancing lawyers and accountants also have to perform customer due diligence checks when carrying out any acquisition, divestment or any other dealing of any interest in real estate, she added.Developers are not allowed to accept cash payment for sales of uncompleted properties, she said.Ms Indranee noted that there are several layers of defence in the real estate sector to mitigate risks of money laundering and protect the system from abuse.The vast majority of transactions are subject to checks of some form and at various stages, she said. Gatekeepers who fall short of their duties will face penalties.In terms of enforcement, the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) oversees property agents and agencies, while the Urban Redevelopment Authority regulates developers, Ms Indranee said. The agencies play an important role in ensuring that gatekeepers carry out their responsibilities properly, she added.Ms He asked how many property agents, developers and owners have been investigated in the last three years for failing to exercise customer due diligence checks.Ms Indranee said that since 2021, the CEA has taken action against two property agents who were found guilty of breaching the Estate Agents Act and prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism rules.They had failed to comply with regulations relating to obtaining, documenting and verifying the accuracy of their clients identity information. They also failed to assess the risk of clients engaging in money laundering or terrorism financing, she added.In the latest case in July 2023 unrelated to the money laundering scandal the agent was fined $4,000 and suspended for four months.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

About two-thirds of the 919 respondents surveyed by Bloomberg believe that the US office market will rebound only after a severe collapse. An even greater majority say that US commercial real estate prices will not hit bottom until the second half of 2024 or later. That is bad news for the US$1.5 trillion (S$2 trillion) of commercial real estate debt that, according to Morgan Stanley, is due before the end of 2025. Refinancing it will not be easy, particularly the roughly 25 per cent of commercial property that is office buildings. A Green Street index of commercial property prices has already fallen 16 per cent from its peak in March 2022.Commercial property values are getting hit hard by the Federal Reserves aggressive tightening campaign, which lifts a key cost of owning property the expense of financing. But lenders looking to offload their exposure now are finding few palatable options, because there are not many buyers convinced the market is close to a bottom. Nobody wants to sell at a huge loss, said Barclays analyst Lea Overby. These are properties that dont need to be sold for long periods of time, and that means holders are likely to delay a sale as long as they can.Adding to the trouble is stress among regional banks, which held about 30 per cent of office building debt as at 2022, according to a March report from Goldman Sachs. Smaller banks saw their deposits shrink by nearly 2 per cent over the 12 months that ended in August, according to the Fed, after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. That translates to less funding for the banks, giving them less capacity to lend. Pain from higher interest rates can take years to filter through to owners of US commercial real estate, which Morgan Stanley values at US$11 trillion in total. Investors in office buildings, for example, often have long-term fixed-rate financing in place, and their tenants can be subject to long-term leases as well.It will take until 2027 for leases that are in place today to roll over to lower revenue expectations, according to research by Moodys Investors Service. If current trends hold, then revenues by then will be 10 per cent lower than todays. Even if there is a serious and prolonged downturn in US commercial real estate, including major loan losses from a cratering office sector, Ms Overby is not worried it will threaten overall market stability. The property sector is large, but the debt is spread across a wide enough array of investors to absorb losses, she said.Besides high interest rates, offices are struggling with tenants cutting back or moving out, with the trend especially strong in the US, where employees are more reluctant to come back to work in their offices than in Europe or Asia. Some of the resistance to the return to offices could be attributed to commuting pains. More than 40 per cent of MLIV Pulse respondents said they would be enticed to go to the office more often if they had better public transit options. BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Excluding state land deals, total investment volume would come in at just $2.9 billion, a drop of 8.5 per cent quarter on quarter, according to a report released by Colliers on Monday.The largest GLS deal in the third quarter was the sale of a commercial and residential site in Tampines Avenue 11 to a joint venture by a UOL-Singapore Land consortium and CapitaLand Development for $1.21 billion, or $885 per sq ft (psf) per plot ratio.In second place is the GLS site in Marina Gardens Lane, which was awarded to Chinese developer Kingsford Huray Development and two other partners for $1.03 billion, or $1,402 psf per plot ratio.Despite a strong showing in the third quarter, total investment sales are forecast to drop to between $22.5 billion and $25 billion in 2023, compared with nearly $30 billion in 2022.This is due to higher interest rates, heightened uncertainty arising from the banking turmoil and tightened liquidity earlier in 2023, and higher interest rates and financing costs inhibiting larger investments, said Ms Catherine He, Colliers head of research, Singapore. The latest round of cooling measures in April alsomade investing in residential assets prohibitive for foreigners and entities, she added.But she believes thatwith interest rates peaking and more GLS tenders coming up at the year-end, investment volume may surprise on the upside.Five residential GLS sites were awarded in the third quarter alone, and the residential sector, driven by state land tender sales, is expected to lead 2023s investment volumes, according to Cushman & Wakefields latest Singapore capital markets report. For the rest of the year, sales will be driven by the upcoming tender closing of GLS sites, including Clementi Avenue 1, Pine Grove (Parcel B) and Lorong 1 Toa Payoh. Amid still-low unsold inventory, developers are land banking even as they turn cautious due to higher borrowing costs and uncertain demand following several rounds of cooling measures.Developers are placing their bets strategically, with a preference towards smaller to medium-sized sites and/or sites with low future market competition. Meanwhile, the gap in buyer-seller expectations will continue to be a challenge for the residential en bloc market, said Cushman & Wakefield head of research Wong Xian Yang.But the mixed-use en bloc market is seeing some green shoots, with the $908 million collective sale of Far East Shopping Centre, a mixed-use project with retail and office components, to a company linked to Chinese businessman Du Shuanghua. The sale is pending approval.For the hospitality sector, transaction volumes were driven by the sale of Parkroyal Kitchener Hotel for $525 million in July to Worldwide Hotels, and retail investment deals such asthe sale of Changi City Point by Frasers Centrepoint Trust for $338 million. The steady recovery of Singapores tourism market and increasing visitor arrivals also bode well for prime retail and hotel assets, Mr Wong added. But the office sector remains challenging as office net yields remain significantly below borrowing costs, the Cushman report said. This sector saw a 78.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter drop in transaction volume in the third quarter. But as Singapore works towards its smart and green building objectives, this could help fuel investment sales volumes in 2024. More assets could be put on the market as corporates adopt asset recycling strategies and monetise assets to streamline operations and meet sustainability targets, Mr Wong said.Colliers Ms He expects total investment sales to be slightly higher in 2024 at between $25.2 billion and $27.6 billion as deal-making could still be hampered by weaker rental growth, higher-for-longer interest rates and tighter liquidity. However, real estate investments in Singapore will remain attractive to private wealth investors for its safe haven status. With interest rates peaking, more investors may take positions in recovering sectors such as hospitality and retail, or redeploy capital into higher-yielding assets. In 2024, the Government could continue its substantial rollout of residential and mixed sites to meet housing demand, which will also boost investment sales, Ms He said.That said, there are also downside risks that could derail investment momentum, such as worsening geopolitical tensions or a prolonged recession in the developed economies, she added."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This was also an increase from the 62,597 sq ft of new leases the Reit achieved in Q2 and the 83,588 sq ft signed in Q3 FY2022.The Reits aggregate leverage ratio stood at 33.8 per cent in Q3, while its weighted average lease expiry is now 3.1 years.Mr Donald Han, chief executive of the Reit manager, said the interim managers current focus is to stabilise its portfolio and execute ongoing capital expenditure projects. This includes the asset enhancement initiative at 1 Tuas Avenue 4, which was 45 per cent completed as at end-September.We are on track with our solar panel installations at selected properties, of which two of the four installations have been completed, he added.The Reit was recently in the limelight after its unitholders voted in an extraordinary general meeting to remove SREIM and internalise the Reit manager, a landmark decision for the Singapore Reit market, which has never seen an internally managed Reit.Units of Sabana Reit rose 1.3 per cent or $0.005 to $0.39 before the announcement.

Mr Lee told The Business Times that he went for the bid in his personal capacity rather than the listed IOIPG, due to the size of the subject acquisition as well as the tight timeline set by the collective sales committee (CSC).As IOIPG already has a substantial presence in the Marina Bay area via its presence in its IOI Central Boulevard Towers, W Marina Bay and Marina View Residences, the (acquisition) and redevelopment of Shenton House are both timely and synergistic to IOIPGs presence in Marina Bay, he said.IOIPGs core business comprises property development, property investments and hospitality and leisure across Malaysia, Singapore and Xiamen, China.With over half a million square feet of gross floor area (GFA) for the Shenton House site, Mr Lee plans to develop this strategically located and very prominent site into a Grade A office with luxury-branded service residences.This purchase demonstrates my continued confidence in Singapores prime office sector and residential rental market, Mr Lee added.The site is eligible for 25 per cent bonus GFA under the CBD Incentive Scheme (CBDIS) where it can be redeveloped into a mixed-use commercial with residential commercial or a hotel development at the gross plot ratio of 14, said JLL.The 99-year leasehold development sits in Shenton Way, spanning 36,250 sq ft zoned for commercial use. The site has a plot ratio of 11.2 under the Urban Redevelopment Authoritys Master Plan 2019.At the reserve price of $538 million, and accounting for an estimated land betterment charge of $174 million with a lease top-up premium of $248 million to a fresh 99-year lease, the land rate translates to about $1,889 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) based on the gross plot ratio of 14. This would bring the effective acquisition cost close to $960 million, assuming an apportionment of 60 per cent commercial and 40 per cent residential mixed-use project under the CBDIS for the proposed development.The price of $538 million is below an earlier reserve price of $590 million.JLLs executive director for capital markets, Mr Tan Hong Boon, said the sale had obtained more than 80 per cent of the owners consent prior to the close of the tender. The sale is subject to the expiry of the statutory five-day cooling-off period until Monday, and conditional on the CSC obtaining approval of the sale from the Strata Titles Boards or the court.Mr Tan said Shenton House is the last remaining redevelopment opportunity at this stretch of the prime Shenton Way thoroughfare.Given the limited supply of new Grade A offices in the core of the CBD, as occupiers look to locate to low-carbon modern office space, as well as the limited availability of luxury rental housing in the area, the Shenton House site will fill these gaps timely and further contribute to the rejuvenation of Shenton Way, he added.This is Shenton Houses third attempt at a public tender since April this year.Shenton Houses successful sale en bloc follows that of Far East Shopping Centre, which was snapped up by a company linked to Bright Ruby Resources and Chinese businessman Du Shuanghua for around $910 million in September.

Readings below 50 indicate contraction, whereas those above 50 denote growth.Novembers expansion was helped by broad-based improvements across key indicators such as new exports, factory output and employment. The electronics cluster broke a 15-month losing streak, gaining 0.2 point to reach 50.1, from 49.9 in October.New orders and input purchases both entered expansion territory for the first time since August 2022 and July 2022, respectively.But supplier deliveries remained in the doldrums, recording their sixth consecutive month of contraction, albeit at a slower pace, according to the latest data released by the Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management on Dec 2.DBS Group Research economist Chua Han Teng said Novembers PMI is a sign that the Republics factory activity is gradually recovering, but the upturn within the electronics cluster is still uncertain.He noted: For example, new export orders (for electronics) shrank for the 16th straight month, albeit at a slower pace, which indicates soft overseas demand.Maybank economist Chua Hak Bin said the recovery in manufacturing can be attributed to a number of factors, including a shift in global consumer spending from services to goods, an ongoing tech cycle marked by upgrades and introduction of new models, as well as a depletion of inventories in the US tech sector.The large US fiscal deficit spending and aggressive industrial policy with generous subsidies on semiconductors and electric vehicles are also driving up global electronics demand, he added.Singapores key non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) is expected to shrink by 12 per cent to 12.5 per cent in 2023, compared with Augusts forecast of 9 per cent to 10 per cent, trade agency Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) said in its latest quarterly review of trade performance. For 2024, Nodx is projected to rise by 2 per cent to 4 per cent in tandem with an anticipated turnaround in global electronics demand. EnterpriseSG noted that this demand is expected to gradually recover in 2024, as inventory levels normalise. It added: This would support total trade and Nodx growth.Mr Song Seng Wun, Singapore economic adviser at CGS-CIMB Securities Singapore, said an upswing in the global semiconductor market is expected in 2024, according to data from the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.He added that this development is positive news for Singapores electronics PMI and hence overall PMI in 2024.In November, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in its quarterly economic survey report that the countrys economic growth for 2023 will come in at around 1 per cent amid weak export demand.The forecast was narrowed from a range of 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent announced in August, and was much lower than the prediction of 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent made at the start of the year.Singapores economy grew 3.6 per cent in 2022.MTI also noted that the Republics economy is expected to grow between 1 per cent and 3 per cent in 2024 as trade-related sectors improve modestly."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Sites in areas such as Bayshore and Tampines Street 94 are therefore likely to enjoy pent-up demand.The list also includes more sites for a new class of long-stay serviced apartments in one-north and River Valley Green, which some analysts say could help diversify development risk.Developer participation in GLS tenders has dropped noticeably in the past six months, in the face of heightened economic uncertainty, elevated interest rates and the April 2023 round of cooling measures that raised additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) rates, among other things.Excluding executive condominium (EC) plots, private residential sites received 3.7 bids per site in the second half of 2023, down from an average of 5.2 bids per site in the first half of 2022, ERA Singapore noted. The property agency expects a further dilution of bids with 10 confirmed list sites slated for release in the first half of 2024. The 10 sites will supply 5,450 private housing units in total, including ECs the seventh straight half-yearly increase in supply since the first half of 2021.JLLs head of residential research for Singapore, Ms Chia Siew Chuin, noted, however, that the increase in private housing supply has moderated to 5.6 per cent in the first half of 2024. In comparison, such supply in the second half of 2023 jumped 26.2 per cent from the first half of 2023. Excluding ECs, the supply is up just 3 per cent from the second half of 2023, Ms Chiasaid.The moderation in supply means that there is still sufficient land being offered for private housing, yet at the same time, the market is not being oversaturated.Also notable is the absence of new commercial or hotel supply in the first-half 2024 GLS list, ahead of the tender closing in March 2024 of a mega 6.5ha white site in Jurong Lake District Singapores second Central Business District.The white site for a mixed-use development in Woodlands Avenue 2, a short-term lease commercial site in Punggol Walk, and a hotel site in River Valley Road were carried over from the second-half 2023 reserve list to the first-half 2024 reserve list, CBRE noted. Developers can bid to trigger reserve list sites for development if they assess there is demand. The distribution of confirmed list housing supply is the highest in the suburbs with 3,060 units, up nearly 18 per cent from 2,595 units in the second half of 2023, to cater to local demand, JLL noted. In second place is the city fringe with 1,330 units.Confirmed list supply in the prime district also rose from 270 units in the second half of 2023 to 1,060 units in the first half of 2024. This creates an opportunity for developers to landbank in the prime district via GLS, given the persistent mismatch in price expectations between developers and sellers in the collective sales market, Ms Chia said. Mr Wong Xian Yang, Cushman & Wakefields head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia, said the increase in GLS confirmed-list supply could mean an even more subdued private residential collective sales market in the suburbs and city fringe.But developers seeking smaller plots may still turn to the collective sales market because six of the 10 confirmed-list sites are mid- to large sites of more than 500 units, and may be out of reach for smaller players, he added.The first-half 2024 confirmed list includes a Media Circle site in one-north that is stipulated for long-stay serviced apartment use. This means that developers are not under the gun to complete selling the project within five years to obtain remission for ABSD, said Mr Leonard Tay, head of research with Knight Frank.Another site on the reserve list River Valley Green (parcel B) can yield 220 long-stay serviced apartments out of a total of 575 dwelling units. Mr Tay said the inclusion of serviced apartments mitigates developers risk of incurring ABSD, lowering the number of units the successful tenderer needs to sell in order to obtain the remissible ABSD.Of the nine sites on the first-half 2024 reserve list that can yield an additional 3,460 units, Mr Tay said the River Valley Green site, along with the Bayshore Road plot, will have the best chance of being triggered for sale. As the last two GLS tenders in Bayshore now The Bayshore and Costa Del Sol were more than two decades ago, developers and home buyers may seek first-mover advantage by buying into the first private housing site to be sold in the new Bayshore estate. But Ms Tricia Song, CBREs head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia, does not expect the Bayshore Road site to be triggered in the next six months, given ample supply on the confirmed list. A case in point is the Margaret Drive site in Queenstown, which can yield 460 units and is expected to attract keen interest, given a lack of new launches in the vicinity and potential demand from HDB flat upgraders. The last project launched in the area was Margaret Ville in 2018.Another site that is likely to garner strong interest is the sole EC plot on the confirmed list Jalan Loyang Besar in Pasir Ris. This site is located near Pasir Ris MRT station and shopping centres such as Pasir Ris Mall and White Sands, and there has not been a new EC launch in the area since Sea Horizon in 2012.PropNex Realty chief executive Ismail Gafoor said industry observers had hoped that at least one more EC plot would be offered in the confirmed list, given the popularity of this hybrid private-public housing type that has resulted in aggressive bidding for such plots in recent GLS tenders. New record land rates for EC plots are continually being set. The latest one at $721 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr), or $543 million for a 700-unit site at Tampines Street 62 (parcel B), was set in October by Sim Lian Land and Sim Lian Development.This surpassed the previous record of $703 psf ppr for an EC site in Plantation Close in Tengah set in September by Hoi Hup Realty and Sunway Developments.In 2018, the record stood at $583 psf ppr for the site of Piermont Grand EC in Sumang Walk, Punggol.Prices of new EC units have hit a fresh benchmark, with the average transacted price crossing $1,470 psf at Altura EC in Bukit Batok in 2023, PropNex noted.Developers seeking heartland retail exposure will likely gun for a mixed-use site in Tampines Street 94 in Bedok Reservoir Road.Located near Tampines West MRT station, this plot can offer 585 residential units and 10,500 sq m of commercial space in Tampines West, which will add retail amenities to the mature estate. It could also enjoy pent-up demand as this area has not seen any GLS tenders awarded since that of the present Baywater condo site in Bedok Reservoir Road in December 2000.How developers strategise their bids, given the plum sites unveiled in the first-half 2024 GLS programme, will be keenly watched. This especially with a slew of new launches expected to come on stream in 2024, and as buyers remain price-sensitive in the face of still-high interest rates."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The forecast was narrowed from the range of 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent announced in August, and was much lower than the prediction of 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent made at the start of the year.MTI also said that gross domestic product grew 1.1 per cent year on year in the third quarter, a faster pace than the 0.5 per cent in the second quarter and the 0.4 per cent in the first three months of 2023. The growth rate was also better than MTIs advance estimate of 0.7 per cent. Analysts said a better-than-expected outcome in the third quarter could be a sign of stabilisation after anaemic growth in the first half. It may also herald a potential recovery onwards into 2024.On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted basis, the economy grew 1.4 per cent, accelerating from the 0.1 per cent expansion in the second quarter.Growth in the July-August period was aided by the ongoing recovery in air travel and inbound tourism, which has buoyed sectors such as air transport and accommodation. Meanwhile, resilient labour market conditions continue to lend support to consumer-facing sectors like retail trade and food and beverage services.Still, the cumulative effects of higher interest rates and a slower-than-expected Chinese economy have kept overall growth depressed. DBS Bank economist Chua Han Teng said the surprise third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) uptick is in line with improving business sentiments.For the important electronics cluster, Singapore firms anticipate better business conditions from the modest turnaround in global semiconductor sales, following the inventory digestion, even as they are cognisant of lingering geopolitical risks that could still disrupt supply chains, he said.Looking ahead to 2024, MTI said GDP growth rates in major economies such as the United States and euro zone are projected to slow further in the first half of next year due to continued tight financial conditions, before picking up gradually in the second half.This, alongside a normalisation of inventory levels, is likely to support a turnaround in global manufacturing activity over the course of the year. In particular, global electronics demand is projected to recover, which will bolster the growth of most regional economies, MTI said.Against this backdrop, the growth prospects of the manufacturing and trade-related sectors in Singapore, such as electronics, precision engineering and wholesale trade, are expected to improve in tandem with the turnaround in global electronics demand, said Mr Gabriel Lim, MTIs Permanent Secretary for Policy.Meanwhile, the finance and insurance sector is forecast to post a modest recovery as global interest rates moderate, he added.Enterprise Singapore on Nov 22 predicted a modest recovery for key exports in 2024 after lowering its forecast for 2023 amid a worse-than-expected performance.It now expects key non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) to shrink by 12 per cent to 12.5 per cent in 2023, compared with Augusts forecast of a 9 per cent to 10 per cent contraction. For 2024, Nodx is projected to rise by 2 per cent to 4 per cent in tandem with the expected turnaround in global electronics demand.Mr Barnabas Gan, acting chief economist at RHB Bank, said the relatively buoyant outlook for the Singapore economy is backed by continued improvement in growth-related momentum globally and across Asean economies.He said global central banks are approaching their peak interest rate objectives, which means rate cuts in the second half of 2024 may be on the table. Meanwhile, there is hope for China to see a better economic prognosis in the coming quarters, which will support global semiconductor demand.We expect the growth momentum seen in Singapores externally facing sectors, namely industrial production and exports, to persist into 2024. Beyond that, we do not see evidence of a recession in global and Asean-centric numbers for the coming year, Mr Gan said.MTIs Mr Lim warned that significant downside risks in the global economy remain.Core inflation in advanced economies which excludes volatile food and energy costs could induce central banks to maintain current high interest rates for longer. Also, an escalation or a widening of the Israel-Hamas conflict or the war in Ukraine could lead to renewed supply disruptions and commodity price shocks.The confluence of these factors could weigh on both business and consumer sentiments along with demand, leading to a slowdown in global growth and trade, Mr Lim said.Mr Edward Robinson, chief economist at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said the central bank maintains its forecast for inflation for 2024 even as economic growth is likely to improve.He said Singapores core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport costs, is projected to come in at around 4 per cent in 2023, unchanged from 2022. For 2024, the forecast remains at the 2.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent range.Mr Robinson also reiterated that MAS current policy stance remains appropriate.In the third quarter of 2023, the manufacturing sector shrank by 4.6 per cent year on year, compared with the 7.6 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. All clusters within the sector contracted except for transport engineering.The construction sector grew 6.3 per cent, extending the 7.7 per cent expansion in the second quarter, as both public- and private-sector construction output rose.Growth in the information and communications sector eased to 5.6 per cent, from 7 per cent in the second quarter. The real estate sector grew 3.4 per cent, slowing from the 12.1 per cent expansion in the second quarter."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Overall rental transaction volume was down by 9 per cent from the previous year.Rental growth in Q1 was likely driven by higher rents sought by landlords for better-performing quality premises, noted Tan Boon Leong, JLLs executive director for logistics and industrial.Single-user factory and business park rents rose the most by 2.1 per cent in Q1 while warehouses had a 2 per cent increase, and multiple-user factories recorded a 1.3 per cent change over the previous quarter.On a yearly basis, rents for multiple-user factories and single-user factories grew 8.9 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively. Warehouse rents rose 7.5 per cent and business park rents increased 5 per cent.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Supply continued to be tight this quarter, especially in the prime logistics space where there is no upcoming supply for the rest of the year. Third-party logistics (3PLs) and consumer products are the main demand drivers for warehouses, said Colliers He.Colliers expects more space to come into the market as some tenants downsize or relocate, together with higher supply completing in 2025. Occupiers may also opt to develop sites themselves or relocate to cheaper locations.This will likely cause occupancy rates and rents to ease further (for the warehouse segment), added He.CBREs head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia, Tricia Song, observed that while some logistics occupiers have started to show resistance to higher rents, they remain keen to pivot away from traditional warehouses.Landlords with prime logistics assets remain well positioned to capture demand from large-scale end-users such as 3PLs, she added.Prices for industrial space dipped 0.2 per cent compared to Q4 2023, in their first quarter-on-quarter drop in 13 quarters since Q3 2020, JTC said.Song added: While investors generally expect interest rates to come down by years end, the uncertainty over the timing of these interest rate cuts could have dampened sentiment for some investors in Q1 2024. That said, yields for leasehold industrial assets remain attractive as they offer investors a positive carry.Huttons Asias senior director of data analytics, Lee Sze Teck, noted that prices in the single-user factory segment had dropped for two consecutive quarters.Yoy, overall prices were up 3.3 per cent, while transaction volume fell 2 per cent.Multiple-user factories saw 0.5 per cent growth, and prices were up 4.6 per cent compared to the year-ago quarter. Single-user factory prices declined by 1 per cent, and were 1.8 per cent higher against Q1 2023.Demand for multiple-user factories, especially those with higher-specification spaces, was driven by biomedical and engineering firms, albeit at a slower pace and with most tenants looking at smaller spaces of less than 10,000 square feet, said Colliers.For single-user factories, there is a surge of supply coming on stream in 2024, though these are typically developed by the industrialists for their own use; demand in this segment has been supported by advanced manufacturing players, added He from Colliers.However, together with overall softer demand and leasing activity, rental and price growth for both types are likely to slow.Business park demand remains muted, with more renewals and occupiers right-sizing, said Colliers.The increase in business park rents was likely driven by selected deals in premium spaces, said CBREs Song, noting that median rents in one-north rose the most on a quarterly basis, by 16.3 per cent.Overall occupancy fell 0.3 per cent in Q1 to 88.7 per cent, as supply increases continued to outpace demand. Compared to the year-ago period, the occupancy rate was 0.1 per cent lower.JLLs Tan said the decline in occupancy was due to the doubling in net space additions from 65,000 square metres in Q4 2023 to 127,000 sq m in Q1, while the number of industrial tenancies fell to a 15-quarter low of 2,948 during the quarter.As at end-March, the total available stock of industrial space stood at 53 million sq m. Total available stock rose by 0.7 million sq m, compared with an increase of 0.6 million in total occupied stock over the past year.JTC expects 1.6 million sq m of industrial space to be completed in the rest of this year.Another 1.6 million sq m of industrial space is expected to come on stream in 2025 and 2026. This points to an average annual supply of about 1.2 million sq m from now until end-2026, more than the 1 million sq m average annual supply injected over the past three years, and outweighing the average annual demand of 600,000 sq m.Colliers expects overall industrial rent growth for 2024 to moderate between 3 and 5 per cent, and put price growth at between 1 and 3 per cent."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

We are concerned with potential oversupply of residential apartments as the government ramps up government land sales supply over the last few (quarters). Potential cooling measures are always a concern, commented one survey respondent.Sing Tien Foo, provosts chair professor of real estate at the NUS Business School, said: The outlook of the prime residential sector remains subdued. The Additional Buyers Stamp Duty still impacts demand from foreign buyers and investors.Data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed that prices of private residential properties rose 1.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, slower than the 2.8 per cent gain in Q4 2023. The latest figure is also the slowest quarterly gain since Q3 2021. Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Despite that, real estate players did not anticipate that developers would hold back new launches or reduce prices, although fewer respondents expected new launch prices to increase. In Q1, 22.2 per cent of respondents expected unit prices of new launches in the next six months to be moderately higher, down from 42.9 per cent in the preceding quarter, while 72.2 per cent of them believed new launch prices would be the same, up from 47.6 per cent in the last quarter.Only 5.6 per cent of property players expected prices to be moderately less.Among respondents, 27.8 per cent of them expect a moderately or substantially higher number of units to be launched in the next six months, down 29 percentage points from Q4 2023; 72.2 per cent of them expect the number to remain the same, a sizeable increase from last quarters 42.9 per cent, said Ireus.None of the respondents felt that the number of units launched would decrease.Homebuyers have become more resistant to high price points and discerning amid ample new project options. While developers are expected to adopt sensitive pricing strategies, major price corrections are unlikely due to previously committed land and development costs, said a survey respondent. Healthy household balance sheets and the prevailing low unemployment level are also expected to continue supporting demand and prices, they added.Those polled were most optimistic about prospects in the hotel/serviced apartment sector, buoyed by strong tourism arrivals and receipts, said Ireus, which conducts the quarterly survey.Industry professionals were also more positive than negative on suburban retail and the industrial/logistics business.Notably, the future sentiment index reflecting sentiment over the next six months reached 5.1, above the neutral score of five, for the first time in five consecutive months, said Ireus.The current sentiment index reflecting sentiment over the past six months inched up to 4.7 in Q1, from a score of 4.4 in the preceding quarter. Sentiment has picked up in the last six months. The index edged up from a score of 4.2 in Q3 2023 to 4.4 at the end of last year. Ireus director Qian Wenlan said: Overall, Singapores macroeconomic indicators are doing well, which barring unforeseen shocks, point to a healthy economy that could recover over the year ahead.Based on the Ministry of Trade and Industrys Q1 update, the economy grew by 2.7 per cent on a yearly basis over the first quarter, faster than the 2.2 per cent growth recorded for the previous quarter. For 2024, projected growth remains healthy, between the 1 and 3 per cent range. The improved sentiment in Q1 was also due to a strong Singapore dollar which has helped to ease inflation, said Prof Qian.Where industry players were most downbeat, in the prime residential sector, responses recorded a future net balance of minus 44 per cent versus minus 18 per cent in the previous quarter.Industry players were also pessimistic on the office sector and on business parks.This is in line with URAs figures which showed that the office rental index fell 1.7 per cent for the central region in Q1 2024 after climbing 27.5 per cent over nine consecutive quarters.This contrasts with the 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase seen at the end of 2023.Prof Sing said: The work-from-home arrangement dampens office sentiment and encourages a flight to quality among firms.While a slowdown in the global economy was the top risk to watch again, slightly fewer flagged it - about 73.5 per cent of respondents compared to 89.5 per cent during last quarter. Another 55.9 per cent in Q1 cited job losses/decline in the domestic economy as another major risk factor, versus 57.9 per cent of them who said so in Q4 2023. Concerns over rising inflation/interest rates ranked third among the top risks at 50 per cent, up from 44.7 per cent in Q4.In Q1, more property executives identified the tightening of financing/liquidity in the debt market as potential risk, up from 42.1 per cent last quarter to 47.1 per cent. The increased supply of new development land also raised more concerns, from 23.7 per cent in Q4 to 29.4 per cent this quarter.On the other hand, respondents were less concernedin Q1 about rising costs of construction,excessive supply of new property launches,and government intervention to cool the market.The risk of a real estate price bubble ranked the lowest, rising to 2.9 per cent in Q1 from 2.6 per cent in Q4.In Q1, respondents identified land and labour as the top concerns over the next six months, at 22.2 per cent each. Other factors that respondents were concerned about include finance (16.7 per cent) and building materials (11.1 per cent).

This year, investors are warming to it once again and thats helped revive a key property debt market.Investors have snapped up about US$24.6 billion of new commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) so far in 2024, 170 per cent more than the same period in 2023, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Spreads on the riskiest portions of CMBS deals have been among the top performers compared to other widely traded types of credit.When lightning-quick bankruptcies felled several regional lenders last year and interest rates seemed on an endless march higher, the commercial-property market all but ground to a halt. CMBS issuance plunged, and spreads blew out.Now those fears are receding. A once-frozen market for office towers is seeing deals again, and major real estate investors including Blackstone are greenlighting big investments in a sign that they believe property markets have begun to rebound. Add to that a Federal Reserve thats signalled the end of rate increases notwithstanding recent suggestions of a longer-than-expected timeline for cuts and investors are once again ready to dive into new issues.Investors have warmed significantly to commercial real estate this year, said TJ Durkin, head of structured credit and speciality finance at TPG Angelo Gordon. Its much different than the fear that characterised last year.Among the highlights this year are a US$2.35 billion CMBS issued by Blackstone. That deal, which priced in March, is backed by a portfolio of 186 industrial properties across 11 states.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.For CMBS buyers, the difference between this year and last is that theyre no longer applying blanket assumptions to the sector, said Morris Chen, a portfolio manager at DoubleLine Group. Instead, theyre sharpening their pencils, looking for value on a deal-by-deal basis.Back then, the market was overly bearish, thinking about the worst possible outcome, said Chen. It began to look beat up compared to other asset classes. Thats brought investors back in.Demand for deals has driven spreads tighter, with CMBS bonds rated BBB- shrinking more than 250 basis points from a year ago, according to Citigroup data as at Apr 22. Only private residential mortgage backed securities and some of the riskiest collateralised loan tranches have done better, while investment-grade and high-yield corporate debt, asset-backed bonds and agency borrowing havent narrowed as much.Those tighter spreads in turn are helping draw in more borrowers.Borrowers have been holding out for an opportunity to refinance debt with short-term maturities and now theyre seizing on lower spreads to do it, said Raviv Shtaingos, head of structured credit at Orix Corporation USA.Much of the shift in sentiment has occurred over the past few months, as a consensus developed that the Feds next move will be to lower interest rates. Thats good news for the bond investors and real estate owners and issuers who had been waiting for clarity on the end of the hikes.People have been listening to the Fed and looking at economic data and concluding, Rates are coming down or stabilising, now is a good time to do deals, said Paul Staples, a trader at Academy Securities.To be sure, the gloom hasnt entirely lifted. Theres still a long way to go to refinance a CMBS maturity wall that stood at US$210 billion at the end of last year. And as long as interest rates remain above the super-low levels many borrowers locked in during the pandemic, valuation drops will continue to ripple through property markets as cap rates a key metric used to price commercial real estate adjust upwards.In recent weeks, of course, hot inflation data has upended some of that certainty about the Feds interest rate plans. Policymakers will meet this week and traders will parse Chair Jerome Powells comments for clues about the latest thinking around easing policy.But perhaps surprisingly, a higher-for-longer rate outlook may actually help lift CMBS issuance levels for the remainder of the year, according to a note by Bank of America strategists Alan Todd and Henry Brooks recently. The bank revised upwards its issuance forecast for CMBS by 20 per cent to US$90 billion for the year. That would put this years issuance in line with the US$91 billion average for the last eight years, according to Bloomberg data.A greater number of borrowers may simply decide to bite the bullet if it begins to look like rates are unlikely to fall anytime soon, they wrote.

On a quarterly basis, prime office rents rose 0.7 per cent in the second quarter to an average of S$11.28 per square foot per month, up from the 0.6 per cent growth seen in the first.Despite the larger islandwide trend of rents either holding or increasing marginally, some landlords have started to adjust their rental expectations, especially for buildings with pockets of available space, said Knight Frank.Data from Cushman & Wakefield (C&W) showed that Central Business District (CBD) Grade A office vacancy rose to 5.4 per cent during Q2, from 3.6 per cent in Q1.The rise in vacancy was due to the completion of IOI Central Boulevard Towers and Odeon 333 with a combined net lettable area of 1.3 million square feet (sq ft) which outweighed net demand of 0.6 million sq ft in Q2.Many Grade A office landlords, assured by high occupancy rates, continue to be sanguine on the prospects of the Singapore office market and have largely held on to their asking rents said Jeryl Teoh, senior director and co-head of commercial leasing at C&W. Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Occupancy levels in the Raffles Place/Marina Bay precinct and in the overall CBD area had declined to 95 per cent and 93.6 per cent, respectively, in Q2, from 95.6 per cent and 94.7 per cent in the preceding quarter, said Knight Frank. The consultancy attributed this dip in occupancy levels to the longer lead time for decanted spaces to be absorbed.More decanted spaces surfaced in the market as certain companies in the financial and technology sectors began consolidating their business functions, typically in one location.For example, Tencent, recently announced their relocation to CapitaSky, while fellow tech giant Meta will not be renewing 115,000 sq ft at South Beach Tower, and will consolidate at Marina One. French bank BNP Paribas was also reported not to be renewing some of its current space at Ocean Financial Centre.As more quality decanted space becomes available, Knight Frank said that landlords face pressure to moderate their rent expectations.With the completion of IOI Central Boulevard Towers and substantial upcoming lease expiries, we are observing that landlords are prioritising occupancies in their own developments, as they are increasingly more aware of the fact that tenants have more space options in the market, said Tricia Song, CBREs head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia.David McKellar, CBREs co-head of office services and occupier services, added: As a result, they are prioritising occupancies in their buildings and are therefore more willing to negotiate on rents. C&Ws senior director and co-head of commercial leasing, Leong Deyang observed that the high interest rate environment continues to dampen new office demand.There are signs of cracks appearing, he said. Some right-sizing activities have continued as occupiers look to reduce cost and align their workplace to a hybrid work model, he noted.Excluding the net demand stemming from the IOI Central Boulevard Towers pre-commitment, Q2 2024 net demand would fall to only 33,000 sq ft, similar to 30,000 sq ft in Q1 2024, added Leong.The report from Knight Frank cited the insurance and private-wealth sectors as continuing to support growth amid the quiet office-leasing market.CBRE said: Firms in the legal sector and some of the Chinese technology giants have been some of the biggest contributors towards the expanded demand this quarter. These sectors have shown strong demand, in spite of perceived macroeconomic uncertainties.Song added: While H1 2024 has been weighed down by the uncertainty of new completions, we may see a pick-up in H2 2024 with leasing activity for new developments gaining momentum. Flight to quality and relocation activity from redevelopment projects and transitional sites will help to drive demand.With landlords increasingly willing to offer reasonable rents to keep buildings filled, especially with space consolidation and reduction by technology firms and banks, Knight Frank expects rents in H2 to be largely unchanged and full-year rents to grow between 1 and 3 per cent.C&W forecasts vacant office space to remain concentrated within a few developments for 2024, with most Grade A offices remaining well occupied. As such, landlords continue to hold the upper hand, although their advantage is starting to diminish, said C&W.C&Ws forecast for CBD Grade A office rents this year is between 0 and 2 per cent, while CBRE expects rents to grow by 2 to 3 per cent in 2024."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

More deals of larger quantums were completed during the quarter, the data showed. Shophouse deals totalled 20 in Q1 with 17 freehold units and three leasehold units sold. In the previous quarter, a total of 16 shophouses were sold, 25 per cent less than in Q1.Overall average unit price rose 27.1 per cent to S$5,566 per square foot (psf) on land, compared with the S$4,380 psf on land in Q4 2023.In 2023, shophouse sales came to 132 units worth S$1.2 billion. The number of units was 31 per cent lower than the 191 units transacted in 2022 worth S$1.6 billion. Shophouse sales have fallen from their peak in 2021, when a total of 254 units worth S$1.94 billion changed hands.Lee Sze Teck, Huttons Asias senior director of data analytics, in a separate report on shophouses, said: The revival of interest in the shophouse market may be due to the Singapore Police Force initiating the process to sell shophouses linked to the money laundering probe. There was some uncertainty over how and when these shophouses will be disposed of.He said that the clarity over the process and prices brought buyers back to the market, which led to slightly more transactions in Q1 2024.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.The Q1 sales reported by Knight Frank did not include sales of any shophouses that were seized in the money laundering probe, that were eventually released for sale to repay creditors.Total transaction value for freehold shophouse units sold in Q1 rose 44 per cent from the previous quarter at S$149.9 million. Leasehold unit sales came to S$19.2 million, up 175.9 per cent from Q4 2023.For freehold shophouses, average unit price increased 10.9 per cent over the quarter to S$5,671 psf on land, from S$5,115 psf on land. Leasehold shophouses showed a steeper surge, with the average unit price rising 243.9 per cent to S$4,895 psf on land, from S$1,423 psf on land in Q4 2023. Since Additional Buyers Stamp Duty rates were hiked upwards last year for foreign buyers and investors buying residential property, interest has filtered into non-residential assets, with agents reporting increased interest in commercial properties such as shophouses. The first quarter of 2024 saw six deals that were signed above S$10 million, three of which were above S$15 million, based on Knight Franks report.District 8, which consists of Little India, Farrer Park and Serangoon Road, stood out with the highest number of sales. Seven shophouseschanged hands, amounting to a total transaction value of S$51.6 million.The biggest deal in Q1 was for the sale of a freehold shophouse at Pagoda Street in District 1 for S$19 million, said Huttons.The seller made an estimated S$2.75 million after holding it for around five years, said Lee.Shophouse leasing volume, meanwhile, slipped during the quarter. The number of rental contracts for shophouseswas 5.6 per cent lower quarter on quarter, and 7.2 per cent lower compared with the year-ago period. Median rents continued to hold firm, inching up by 1.9 per cent in Q1, said Huttons.Lee expects confidence to gradually return to the shophouse market, with the uncertainty over the shophouses implicated in the money laundering probe removed.He said: The shophouse market is expected to see steady interest from investors in the coming quarters. The rarity of shophouses, the lower barrier to entry for foreign investors compared to the residential market, and the potential for capital appreciation will support prices in the market.Knight Frank projects the sales volume of shophouses to be between S$1.1 billion and S$1.2 billion for the rest of 2024."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Over the years, the slew of property curbs rolled out by the Singapore government to cool overly bullish demand bears testament to its tremendous popularity and also to the exceptional resilience of both the asset and its buyers. Despite numerous disincentives, homebuyers return in sufficient numbers, together with a hefty debt appetite, to trigger yet another round of property curbs. The latest set of property cooling measures was introduced in April last year.But what drives demand against such odds? As Qian, Tu, Wu and Xu (2022) highlighted in a working paper titled Unintended consequences of demand-side housing policies: Evidence from household reallocation of capital, a possible explanation lies in the tendency for households to extrapolate from the historical performance of residential real estate without paying heed to obvious market shifts.It is only a matter of time before such unfounded optimism will lead to sobering outcomes, as reality eventually sets in. While demand-side property cooling regulations may be effective in achieving their intended objectives, capital reallocation following policy implementation could generate negative outcomes, as our study discovered. Research findings suggest that policymakers may need to adopt a wider perspective beyond the immediate property market, and also explore ways to manage inelastic household expectations that appear to be oblivious to market signals.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Inefficient allocation in the capital market can create distortions in the sector as well. As money stubbornly flows into real estate stocks in spite of negative signals, developers may be lulled by the additional liquidity to further expand amid a market that is already contracting. Possible consequences include supply overhang, downward pressure on prices, and subsequently a compromised ability to repay debt and equity holders.Our 2022 study observed how households reallocated capital into the stock market following the implementation of the Housing Purchase Restriction (HPR) policy in China. In the wake of it, housing demand plummeted, and market analysts promptly downgraded their assessments of listed real estate developers. Yet, as if in defiance, findings showed that investors affected by the HPR exhibited a tendency to channel their money to real estate stocks. In an attempt to use property stocks as an alternative for betting on housing price growth, those investors eventually experienced significant trading losses.Following the Global Financial Crisis, the Chinese government issued a series of stimulus policies for the housing market, which included the historically lowest mortgage interest rate, higher credit accessibility for developers and lower tax rates for housing transactions.Amid an expansionary fiscal and monetary environment, house prices increased by over 40 per cent countrywide between December 2008 and March 2010, and almost doubled during the same period in top cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.To curb spiralling prices, the Chinese government in April 2010 announced the HPR. Though policy details varied by city, in general, all the HPR cities imposed restrictions for two groups of homebuyers, with the explicit target of curbing investment demand. First, the HPR policy barred non-local residents from any home purchase in the city. Specifically, a person was qualified for home purchase only if he or she had local household registration, or had lived in the city for an extended period (five years or longer for most cities).Second, local residents were also prohibited from purchasing multiple homes in the city. In most HPR cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, a local resident could not purchase additional dwelling units if he or she already owned two units in the city.The staggered implementation of HPR measures across geographically dispersed cities in China over a period of nearly two years allowed us to work with the premise that if investors showed similar behaviours across different times, locations and economic environments, then there is evidence to suggest that the HPR is causing such behaviours.* (see footnote)What we observed was that there was a large and significant increase in stock market participation following the HPR, after controlling for time and location fixed effects.Compared with four weeks before policy implementation, the weekly number of new stock accounts opened by the group being studied increased by nearly 60 per cent during the four weeks following the HPR.In contrast, stock account opening behaviour and cash inflows remain unchanged for investors who were not subject to the same market curbs. The behaviours observed furnished good evidence that capital which would otherwise have been used for property purchases was reallocated into the stock market. The researchers estimated that about 58.3 per cent of households housing investment capital, amounting to about 33 billion yuan (S$6.2 billion), was channelled to the stock market after the HPR.The observed pattern was prevalent across a wide spectrum of investor demographics: the post-HPR propensity to invest in real estate stocks was equally strong across different age groups, by gender or by wealth. The researchers found a strong effect for more experienced investors with a longer account history compared to less experienced investors.In other words, the trading behaviours did not arise from a subgroup of investors who lacked financial sophistication or literacy. Instead, the findings were consistent with the hypothesis that affected households do not adjust their expectations downwards on future house prices, but chose to use the stock market as an indirect way of betting on real estate.Following the HPR implementation, the investors studied experienced a decline in their stock portfolio performance over the next year compared to the year before the policy. The average monthly cumulated abnormal return (CAR) was significantly lower by 0.55 percentage point than that in the pre-HPR period.Notably, this decrease was even more pronounced for their real estate stock holdings. The average monthly CAR for real estate stocks in the affected investors portfolio in the post-HPR period was 0.72 percentage point lower than the pre-HPR period, and such a loss was significantly higher than that of their non-real estate stock holdings.What the research suggests is that well-intended demand-side regulations could generate negative outcomes, as our study discovered. Policymakers may need to adopt a wider perspective beyond the immediate property market, and also explore how to manage inelastic household expectations.

Before April 2015, each individual investor could, by law, only hold one stock account in mainland China the data therefore captured the entire stock holdings of sampled individuals involved in the study. To further corroborate their findings, the researchers created a falsification group. This group consisted of non-local investors residing in HPR cities who had previously migrated from non-HPR cities. While disallowed from buying property in their current HPR city, unlike the treatment group, these investors had the option to invest in property within their hometown cities."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

We look at their recent business updates and financials.CICT reported improved Q1 2024 gross revenue and net property income (NPI) for its retail assets. Shopper traffic and tenant sales grew 3.6 per cent and 2.1 per cent year on year (yoy), respectively. Downtown malls led the growth in traffic, while suburban malls saw sustained resilience from food and beverage demand. Rent reversion for both downtown and suburban malls sustained growth at over 7 per cent. CICTs committed retail occupancy increased from 98.5 per cent in the last quarter to 98.7 per cent as at Mar 31, 2024. FCT reported lower H1 2024 gross revenue and NPI of 7.2 per cent and 8.4 per cent yoy, respectively, with declines due to lower contributions from Changi City Point, which was divested in October 2023, and Tampines 1s ongoing AEI works. Excluding these effects, gross revenue and NPI would have risen 2.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively. Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.FCTs retail portfolio committed occupancy improved to 99.9 per cent as at Mar 31, 2024, and observed an 8.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent yoy growth in shopper traffic and tenant sales for Q2 2024, respectively, with overall positive rent reversion at 7.5 per cent.Lendlease Reit noted that its retail portfolio saw tenant sales increase 2.6 per cent and shopper traffic improve 6.1 per cent yoy in Q3 2024, exceeding pre-Covid levels. Committed occupancy for both the JEM and 313@somerset malls averaged 99.4 per cent as at Mar 31, 2024.MPACTs retail mall, VivoCity, has seen its occupancy rate improve to 100 per cent as at Mar 31, 2024, and recorded 14 per cent positive rent reversion.VivoCitys recent sixth AEI completed in May 2023 saw over 80,000 square feet of reconfigured new retail space, and MPACT noted a return on investment of more than 20 per cent based on revenue on a stabilised basis and capital expenditure of approximately S$10 million. Shopper traffic and tenant sales in Q4 2024 recorded increases of 10.1 per cent and 2.6 per cent yoy, respectively, and full-year tenant sales set a new record at nearly S$1.1 billion.Paragon Reit reported 2.5 per cent yoy growth in gross revenue, driven by Paragon Mall and The Clementi Mall, which recorded higher gross revenue and visitor traffic for Q1 2024, with both malls at full occupancy rates. The Reit plans to explore future acquisition opportunities, and has a right of first refusal on its sponsors The Woodleigh Mall, which opened in May 2023.Starhill Global Reit reported that tenant sales at its Wisma Atria property increased 6.5 per cent while shopper traffic grew 12.7 per cent yoy in Q3 2024, despite ongoing interior enhancement works which were completed in February 2024.Suntec Reits retail portfolio reported a 3 per cent yoy growth in gross revenue and 1.3 per cent growth in NPI for Q1 2024. Its Suntec City mall recorded 21.7 per cent rent reversion in Q1 2024, registering positive rent reversion for eight consecutive quarters. The mall saw a 5 per cent yoy improvement in both tenant sales and shopper traffic for Q1 2024. Suntec Reit expects the retail sales outlook to remain stable, with healthy demand and limited supply supporting rent growth and occupancy.

Rents in the fringe areas fell 1.8 per cent, said Wong Xian Yang, Cushman & Wakefields head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia. He said: Within the central area, Orchard retail market continued to recover with the tourism boost. The iconic shopping belt has been driving brand expansions as retailers position themselves strategically to capture tourists footfall and spending.Islandwide, the Urban Revelopment Authoritys (URA) retail vacancy rate rose 0.2 percentage point in Q1 to 6.7 per cent, following three quarters of decline. This was led by higher vacancy rates in the Downtown Core, Rest of Central Area and fringe areas in the central region, and at suburban locations in the Outside Central Region, noted JLLs consulting director of research and consultancy Angelia Phua.Vacancy rate for the Orchard planning area was 6.8 per cent, while that of the central area outside Orchard was 8.5 per cent. The figure was 5.9 per cent for the rest of Singapore.Business closures in selected malls from underperforming retailers due to higher operational costs, keen competition, unpopular retail concepts and changing consumer preferences likely drove vacancy rates higher, said Phua.

Retail sales performance was mixed in the first quarter, Song noted. January sales (excluding motor vehicles) fell 3 per cent compared to the year-ago period, while February sales were up 7.9 per cent. Figures released by URA on Friday (Apr 26) showed that prices of retail space increased by 1.8 per cent, extending a 1.2 per cent increase in Q4.In Q1, the amount of occupied retail space rose by 8,000 square metres (sq m) net lettable area (NLA), a smaller increase from the 63,000 sq m NLA increase in Q4.Retail stock increased by 19,000 sq m NLA in Q1, compared with an increase of 21,000 sq m in the previous quarter.As at end-Q1, there was a total supply of about 610,000 sq m gross floor area (GFA) of retail space in the pipeline, compared with the 621,000 sq m GFA of retail space in the pipeline in Q4.Retail rents in the central region are expected to stay on track to recovery amid steady office crowds and increasing tourist arrivals, said Wong.Visitor arrivals reached 4.35 million in Q1 and are at about 93 per cent of pre-Covid levels, he said.Amid a below-historical-average level of supply over the next few years, prime retail rents are expected to continue recovering in 2024, said CBREs Song."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Image: TODAY/Nurjannah Suhaimi) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Living in her newly bought three-bedroom condominium in Johor Bahru, Kylie Hung, 27, enjoys all the perks of home ownership as a singleton before hitting 30 - something she is unable to do back in Singapore.And her work as a digital entrepreneur allows her to have total control of her time, which means she does not need to contend with the congestion at the Causeway during peak hours.Ms Hung moved into her Country Garden Danga Bay condominium seven months ago, where she has access to features such as a pool, butler service and a private beach.Ms Hung said she had wanted to move out of her parents' house as she needed her own quiet space, which she felt would help her better focus at work.But private property in Singapore was out of her reach, and she could not buy a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat as the minimum age eligibility for singles is 35.\"If I were to rent a place in Singapore alone, the money would go out of my pocket to something that I don't own,\" she said.\"So I looked at Johor Bahru properties and thought that it made better sense for me to buy. My monthly mortgage would be around the same price as renting a room back home.\"Ms Hung took out a bank loan to finance her 1,237 sq ft abode, which cost around RM700,000 (S$200,000). She currently pays about RM3,500 a month for the mortgage and maintenance fees.While she's happy with her purchase, she acknowledged that moving to Johor Bahru works for her because of her job's flexibility, and it might not be for everyone.\"For those working 9am to 6pm, I wouldn't recommend it because the jam on the Causeway can be quite bad.\"Even so, buying property in Johor was all the hype among Singaporeans about a decade ago, when Iskandar Malaysia, the main southern economic corridor in Johor, opened for business.The draw for those Singaporeans was much the same as for Ms Hung: The ability to own and live in a luxury home at a much lower price than its equivalent in Singapore.Since then, TODAY has found that there are those who are pleased they made the leap and those who regret it.Mr Eric Sim, who bought two four-bedroom units of 2,400 sq ft each near JB Sentral in 2014, said the investment had left a bad taste in his mouth until today.Each unit of four bedrooms and six bathrooms was financed with a bank loan after a 10 per cent down payment.Although prospects looked good then, driven by economic development and mega infrastructure projects such as the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), things subsequently went downhill.\"I bought them as an investment because I thought (Iskandar) would be the next Shenzhen. But it was just an illusion,\" the 54-year-old career book author lamented.\"I realised after buying that there were no big companies in Johor Bahru, whereas, in Shenzhen, there are Tencent, Huawei and Shenzhen Airlines. So, there won't be any high-salary talent attraction to support the high property prices.\"Three more factors threw Mr Sim's plans out of kilter: The onslaught of new projects raised supply above demand, the 2018 Malaysian general election culminated in a change in government and policies, such as the cancellation of the HSR project and lastly, the ringgit continued to weaken against the Singapore dollar.When he invested in his properties in 2014, S$1 was about RM2.60. In February this year, the Singapore dollar rose to a record high of RM3.55.Mr Sim found it difficult to rent out his properties. Even if he had found tenants, the rental would not have been enough to cover his monthly upkeep due to the exchange rate, he said.He finally sold both units this year, at a loss. His total investment cost him a little over RM3 million, but he incurred a loss of RM500,000.\"It was the worst investment of my life,\" Mr Sim said.Even so, interest in Johor homes remains high among Singaporeans. In January, for example, there was some hype over properties near Bukit Chagar where the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link station is located after a commemorative ceremony attended by then Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.But real estate experts told TODAY that rising inflation and property prices at home are the more important reasons driving Singaporean homebuyers up north.The RTS Link is slated to start passenger service by the end of 2026. Once operational, it is expected to ease bottlenecks on the Causeway, allowing easier access across the border.The consistent demand, not just from Singaporeans but investors worldwide too, has buoyed property prices in Johor, which have risen threefold since 2010, according to data from Malaysia's National Property Information Centre (NAPIC).But other news events paint a less rosy picture of the Johor property market.Last year, Forest City, the flagship US$100 billion (S$135 billion) mega-project by Chinese developer Country Garden, was dubbed a \"ghost town\" by the media as the housing estates there were reportedly largely unoccupied. Some buyers, including Singaporeans, were cited by international news outlets expressing disappointment and regret over their investments. A handful said they were fortunate to have sold off their units before the situation took a turn for the worse.In 2022, over at Country Garden Danga Bay, disgruntled owners from Singapore, Malaysia and China filed a class-action lawsuit against the developer, alleging that the developer's luxury condominium was not delivered as advertised.So, for potential investors or homeowners mulling whether to leap into the Johor property market, it can be quite difficult to figure out what the wise decision would be.TODAY examines the reasons behind the current influx of Singaporean buyers in Johor, what they look for in a Johor property and the key things one should consider before putting money down on a house across the border.When Singaporeans think of Johor, it is typically the Johor Bahru area that comes to mind, but in fact, the state government's plans to drive Johor's economic growth extend beyond the city centre.Iskandar Malaysia comprises the Johor Bahru District, Kulai District and part of the Pontian District. Officially launched in 2006, it encompasses an area of 2,217 sq km, nearly three times the size of Singapore.Some of the major cities in Iskandar include the Johor Bahru city centre, Iskandar Puteri (where Legoland is) and Pasir Gudang, one of the largest industrial areas in Malaysia.The launch of Iskandar was aimed at attracting international investments that would drive economic growth for the state. And within Iskandar is the township development of Medini, envisioned as Iskandar Puteri's central business district (CBD). Here, there are no restrictions on foreign home ownership.Generally, foreigners buying properties in Johor must adhere to a minimum purchase price of RM1 million. However, exemptions are granted to certain projects, especially if they were approved before the threshold was implemented on May 1, 2014.Until recently, the piece de resistance of Iskandar was supposed to be Forest City, a colossal luxury real estate project on four man-made islands in the Johor Strait, overlooking the Singapore border.Launched in 2013, Forest City was envisioned as a futuristic, green and smart city. It is Chinese developer Country Garden's largest overseas project, and was planned to house 700,000 people by 2035.Despite its ambitious vision, the project encountered several challenges and controversies due to a mix of low sales, Chinese restrictions on capital outflows, border closures during the pandemic and public backlash against China's increasing influence in Malaysia.Last August, the developer said the project was proceeding as planned despite issues involving the \"political landscape and interference, economic stability (and) government policy\".In December 2023, CNA reported that only 15 per cent of the entire project had been completed. According to the developer, a total of 28,000 residential units have been completed, with 80 per cent of these units sold to buyers from over 30 countries.Around 9,000 residents are said to live in Forest City. TODAY has reached out to Country Garden for the latest figures.In an attempt to spur economic development and attract investors, Forest City was announced as a Special Financial Zone (SFZ) last August. With this designation, businesses are offered incentives to set up operations here, such as a flat income tax rate of 15 per cent instead of the usual 30 per cent, for skilled foreign workers.In preparation for the SFZ designation, Country Garden is building a new customs checkpoint, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. It also announced that several transportation-related infrastructure projects within the massive enclave are in progress.Some international media outlets reported in April that talks were being held on opening a casino in Forest City, citing unnamed sources. But Prime Minister Anwar was quick to squash all talk with an\"affirmative no\" to the idea.Despite the negative news around Forest City, the relaunch of the RTS Link project by Singapore and Malaysia may have renewed Singaporeans' interest in owning property across the border.Mr Tan Kin Lian, a two-time presidential candidate, is among those who have long appreciated the merits of owning a second home there. In 2018, he purchased a 1,100 sq ft three-bedroom unit in Forest City for about RM1.6 million, paid fully in cash.He makes the 2.5-hour journey across Tuas Second Link by public transport twice or thrice a month and stays there for three days each time.When TODAY met the 76-year-old at his Johor abode on May 18, a Saturday, he seemed very much at home. He said he enjoys the peace and tranquillity, as well as the unblocked view of Johors greenery from his balcony.For a place where supposedly 9,000 residents are staying, this reporter found it unusually quiet for a weekend. On Mr Tan's floor, where there are eight units, he said only his was occupied.As we traversed the vast expanse of Forest City via an hourly shuttle bus, only one other passenger boarded it.There were some signs of life at Forest City's transport hub, though, where one can find a good mix of restaurants, shops and a convenience mart open for business. Still, some shop lots were either closed or boarded up, awaiting prospective tenants.Notwithstanding the controversies and rather muted environment, Mr Tan said he is happy with his decision to buy a Forest City unit as he believes in the project's potential. He also found himself drawn to the \"modern city design\".Forest City also appeals to Malaysian workers who work in Singapore, as rental prices are reasonable. Among its residents is Mr Afiq Alwi, a 40-year-old truck driver who is currently renting a 600 sq ft unit with two bedrooms for RM1,000.He said that the rate at Forest City was cheaper compared with units for rent in nearby towns in Iskandar Puteri, such as Gelang Patah: \"For the same unit, I'd be paying RM1,600 there.\"\"I like working in Singapore, but it's expensive to live there because one room can cost minimally S$700 to S$800. For less than that price in ringgit, I can comfortably rent an entire unit all to myself here.\"Six property agents TODAY spoke to said that while a significant number of Singaporeans are looking to buy Johor homes for investment, there are also those looking to live there or have a second home.Operations director Victor Lee, 53, and his wife Crystal Wang, 38, are among the latter. When TODAY met the couple on May 15, they had just collected the keys to their two-bedroom unit at R&F Princess Cove, a condominium project said to be popular among Singaporean buyers.Mr Lee said they paid for the RM800,000, 834 sq ft unit in full, using cash.Thanks to a flexi-work arrangement he can spend one or two days working from home each week Mr Lee, who is in the energy sector, said he is happy with the purchase.\"R&F is near my workplace in Admiralty West. You can see it from my balcony. So geographically, I'm at an advantage,\" he said.Asked if he would brave the notorious congestion on the Causeway several times a week, Mr Lee said there have been promising improvements, with both governments constantly making efforts to smoothen the travel process, such as the recent implementation of electronic gates.\"There are pros and cons. If you live in Singapore, the major expressways are always jammed, and there's ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) to consider. It's a trade-off I can live with.\"Before buying this Johor house, the couple had been renting a studio unit in Singapore for S$2,000 monthly. Mr Lee also owns an HDB flat where his parents live.\"We decided to look to JB and thought, instead of renting, why don't we put our money into a place we can call our own?\" he said.On safety concerns in Johor Bahru, Mr Lee said he would do his best to take precautions, such as avoiding going out alone at night and into dark alleyways.A Singaporean father of two, who wanted to be known only as Mr Afiq for privacy reasons (not to be confused with Mr Afiq Alwi above), is looking to buy a property in Johor within the next 12 months.For the last six months, he has been renting a 1,500 sq ft double-storey terrace house in Horizon Hills, Iskandar Puteri, with his wife and two kids, aged six and nine, for RM3,500 a month, and he likes the lifestyle there.Mr Afiq, who works in finance, said before moving there, he had been entertaining the thought of relocating to Johor as he can work remotely most of the time.It was when his wife decided to quit her job as an agricultural scientist to recover from burnout that he mooted the idea and she agreed.\"One main reason that pushed me to move my family here was so that I could send my kids to an international school, where they get to learn Chinese as a required subject and socialise in a melting pot of different nationalities,\" he said.The difference in cost of living was another push factor, as Mr Afiq is currently spending S$20,000 a year on his kids' education. If he were to do the same in Singapore, he estimated that he would easily be paying twice or thrice that amount.\"At this point, I can confidently say that we plan to move to Johor for the long term. Unless there are big regulatory changes, we'll probably live in Johor for the next two to five years.\"Regarding security, Mr Afiq said every city or state has different security standards in different areas, and the same goes for Johor.\"I know from my Malaysian friends that certain areas in Johor are considerably poorer, where the likelihood of you being robbed or your car being broken into is quite high,\" he said.\"But that's why staying in a gated community helps. My family and I are also not flashy people. I own a cheap entry-level local car so that we can get around easily. We try to avoid unsafe areas.\"In contrast to those who bought the apartments to live in, the picture is less rosy for investors including those who entered the Johor property market 10 years ago.A supply chain manager who wished to be known only as Mr Lee invested in a property the same year as Mr Sim, the author who sold off his units at a loss.Mr Lee bought a RM1.7 million double-storey cluster house in Horizon Hills. The 2,514 sq ft house has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, and he financed the purchase with a bank loan.\"The Johor property market was booming, so my friends also bought properties in Johor as investments. I expected to be able to sell my house within five years and make a profit due to capital appreciation,\" said the 40-year-old.However, things did not go as planned. In his view, the launch of Forest City \"killed the property market\".\"There's an oversupply of units because of the project. We did not expect the developers from China to come in that fast. If I were to sell now, I would be looking at a loss,\" said Mr Lee.\"I kind of regret buying the property because I could have put the money to better use. If given a choice, I wouldn't have done it.\"Mr Lee told TODAY that he is still holding onto his unit. He hopes the newly announced plans, such as the Singapore-Johor Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and RTS Link, would eventually drive up demand and prices.Mr Sim said most buyers, like himself, tend to get caught up in thinking that buying property in Johor is lucrative simply because \"the psf (price per square foot) is so cheap ... cheaper than HDB\".But he said there are other factors to consider. For example, in Singapore condominiums, units typically require \"some curtains and lights\" before being deemed viable for rental, he noted.\"But in Malaysia, it's not like that. You need to do up the cabinet and kitchen, not just curtains and lights. So, with everything considered, I would need to spend about RM80,000 for my units just to get them in good condition before renting them out.\"So I thought I might as well not rent them out because it would jeopardise my chances of selling the units off eventually,\" he said.Despite stories like Mr Lee's and Mr Sim's, overall demand for Johor property has stayed strong.Data from Malaysias NAPIC shows that the property price index for Johor state, which was given a value of 100 in the base year of 2010, soared to 313.3 in 2023, which means prices more than tripled on average.The increase is more drastic for Johor Bahru, as the price index stood at 400 in 2023, from the same base year value of 100.In Singapore, based on the Urban Redevelopment Authority Realis data, the property price index climbed from 125.1 in the first quarter of 2010 to 204 in the first quarter of this year, a 63 per cent increase.Meanwhile, PropertyGuru Singapore country manager Dr Tan Tee Khoon said that as of April this year, demand for residential homes in Johor Bahru recorded an increase of \"close to three times\" since October 2019.This is based on the firm's \"demand index\", which calculates the number of visitors to property listings, weighted by their engagement and search behaviour.The demand index for residential homes for rent in Johor Bahru also experienced a significant jump after the reopening of the Johor-Singapore border in February 2022, he said, and since then, rental demand has remained largely stable.Using asking prices for service residences as a proxy for price movement, the median psf was RM488.75 as of April 2024, up from RM397.35 in March 2022, he said, adding that this was also higher than the pre-COVID-19 median price of RM449.07 psf.\"Notably, nearly 44 per cent of property seekers looking for a residential property in Johor Bahru in April 2024 were from Singapore,\" he said.Dr Tan cited several reasons that contributed to this, such as the full reopening of Singapore's international borders on Apr 1, 2022, which significantly boosted the demand for homes in Johor Bahru, particularly among Malaysians working in Singapore.\"High rents and a strong Singaporean currency make owning a home in Johor Bahru more attractive. Additionally, the announcement of the SEZ and RTS further drove up rental prices,\" he said.Mr Faizul Ridzuan, chief executive officer of property investment firm Far Capital, agreed.\"In Singapore, property values have gone up by 30 to 40 per cent in 24 months. After COVID, rentals have gone up by 60 per cent,\" he told TODAY.\"There's nothing new or sexy about Johor. It's been like this for years. This time around, the primary push factors are coming from Singapore, as the cost of living has gone up substantially in the last 12 to 24 months, forcing people to look for cheaper alternatives, along with the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit against SGD.\"Real estate negotiator Edward Lee said Singapore's housing policies, which levy a higher stamp duty on second and subsequent properties, also contributed to the increase in demand.\"Once the RTS is completed, I believe property prices will be even higher than today,\" he added.The hot Johor property market has led some to wonder whether there would be any spillover effect on the prices of HDB flats at housing estates near the Woodlands Checkpoint, like Woodlands town itself.But Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at PropNex Realty, said she believes that the HDB prices and rental trends in Woodlands generally align with overall market movement in Singapore, rather than specific locational attributes.\"That said, transaction activity, particularly HDB resale and rental activity, has been gaining some traction recently for Woodlands town,\" she said.The HDB resale volume in Woodlands has seen a year-on-year increase since 2021. In 2022, there was a year-on-year increase of 14.2 per cent, while 2023 recorded a 10 per cent jump.Ms Wong said that this can be attributed to overall improvements in infrastructure and ongoing efforts to transform the estate into a commercial hub, which has helped boost the quality of life and employment opportunities within the area.\"The recent opening of the Thomson-East Coast Line has also greatly improved connectivity ... Proximity to well-established amenities such as schools, malls and the Causeway are all perks that further boost its popularity among residents,\" she said.All things considered, is investing in a property in Johor a worthwhile investment? Property experts and homeowners advise prospective buyers to do their homework thoroughly before making a decision.Mr Sim, the former investment banker, said one should refrain from following investment trends without research.\"If I could turn back time, I would do a little more research on the economic activities in the area. I would also check the housing supply not the number of units available at that point in time, but the amount of land and whether property developers would build more.\"If I had done my homework back in 2014, I would've found information that other developers had plans to go big,\" he said, referring to Forest City.Real estate agent Ryan Khoo, who deals with properties in Johor, said it's a good idea to look into the developer's background before making a purchase.\"Look for reputable ones that are publicly listed and have solid track records. For example, they have built existing projects in Johor or other parts of Malaysia that you can visit,\" he said.Mr Faizul of Far Capital stressed the importance of looking at a property in Malaysia through the lens of a local, instead of a Singaporean.\"When you use a Singaporean mindset to buy a property in Johor, it's suicidal,\" he said, since the buyer may end up overpaying for their purchase.Illustrating his point, Mr Faizul said the average property price in Johor 10 years ago, including high-rise and landed units, was about RM300,000.\"When Singaporeans come in, they pay way more than that. Perhaps over RM500,000 to RM1 million, whereas the average local only pays RM300,000. When you overpay, the probability of profit will be greatly reduced.\"When investing based on the potential of future infrastructure and amenities, Mr Faizul advised prospective buyers to be patient and only make the move when there is concrete movement for the projects. \"Like the RTS, when you see movements from both governments, then you know for sure it won't be cancelled. (Wait until things are) built first, instead of investing during the talking stage.\"I'll give you an analogy. You commit to someone who is serious about you. Just because your friend comes and tells you about this person who is ideal, rich and good-looking, it doesn't mean you stop doing your due diligence, and marry the person straight away, right?\"Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Dr Tan Tee Khoon was the country manager of PropertyGuru Malaysia.

According to Oxford Economics, the Singapore economy could expand by 1.4 per cent this year compared with a 0.7 per cent growth in 2019.Colliers anticipates a 3 per cent y-o-y increase for residential investment sales, on the back of a stable supply of public land sales, sustained luxury homes demand and developers acquiring sites to shore up their development pipeline towards the end of the year.The hospitality sector experienced its best year in 2019, with investment sales more than quadrupling to an all-time high of S$5.7 billion.Colliers said investment demand for Singapore's hospitality assets will remain sustained, supported by steady visitor arrivals and more MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) events.\"While the new Wuhan coronavirus presents a near-term downside risk, Colliers believes that the long-term growth drivers for the tourism sector remain largely intact,\" the firm said.Industrial investment sales climbed 10.7 per cent y-o-y to S$2.3 billion in Q4 2019, anchored by Mapletree Commercial TrustTrust's acquisition of Mapletree Business City (Phase II).\"We forecast industrial sales to accelerate in 2020, on big ticket investments by industrialists, Reits and institutional investors into yield accretive assets like business parks and data centres,\" said Ms Song.\"Industrial deals should rise by an average 15 per cent per annum from 2019 to 2024 as the overall underlying market bottoms out.\"Colliers' definition of investment sales transactions includes all private property sales which transacted for S$10 million and above, and all awarded state land tenders."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Chinese New Year was also earlier this year than last year - a fact that would have skewed February's data, say economists.Indeed, forecasters had expected February's rebound in manufacturing growth. The 19 economists polled by Bloomberg prior to the data release had a median growth forecast of 12.9 per cent - just 0.1 of a percentage point higher than the actual figure.In sequential terms, manufacturing output outstripped the market's expectations to jump 6.2 per cent from January, after seasonal adjustments. The 10 economists polled by Bloomberg had a median forecast of 3.8 per cent month-on-month growth.Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output rose 3.8 per cent month-on-month.Economists also pointed out that February's growth was boosted by the typically volatile biomedical cluster. Said Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) economist Chua Hak Bin: \"On the surface things may look pretty dandy, and manufacturing looks to be holding up fairly decently. But just bear in mind that it's partly driven by some of the more volatile components . . . So it's harder to conclude that this confirms that Singapore's export recovery is on a sustained basis.\"Even so, excluding the biomedical cluster, output would still have risen 11.2 per cent year-on-year, said the Singapore Economic Development Board yesterday.Economists say that they will be looking at March and April industrial output figures more closely, since those are unlikely to be marred by the base or seasonal effects which have plagued the first two months of this year.Said CIMB economist Song Seng Wun: \"We think the (industrial production) reading will normalise to the mid-single-digit range from March onwards - unless of course you get the volatile pharmaceutical segment coming in to lift output in a big way.\"Despite February's strong manufacturing output figures, economists from BAML, CIMB, Citi, Credit Suisse and UOB are expecting a marginal sequential correction to GDP in the first quarter of this year, as payback for the strong quarter-on-quarter momentum seen in Q4 last year.Singapore's GDP grew 5.5 per cent in Q4 from a year ago, shooting past the flash estimate of 4.4 per cent to beat the market consensus forecast of 5.2 per cent growth as well. This meant a quarter-on-quarter annualised rate of 6.1 per cent growth - far better than the government's advance estimate of a 2.7 per cent contraction.Said UOB economist Francis Tan: \"We're going to see a slight pullback in Q1 GDP (quarter-on-quarter), mostly because of the strength seen in the previous quarter. I wouldn't be too concerned, though - at -0.5 per cent, the contraction will be quite minor.\"Credit Suisse's Michael Wan thinks growth momentum will pick up from the second quarter onwards, \"given a more buoyant EU, coupled with the US expected to bounce back in Q2 following a snow-laden start to the year\".Added Barclays economists Leong Wai Ho and Bill Diviney in a research note: \"Overall, the data is consistent with firm producer confidence in Singapore, and points to expectations of a further gradual recovery in exports. We continue to expect Singapore to benefit from strengthening global demand in 2014, though there is likely to be a longer lag than in previous cycles.\"Economists from ANZ, Barclays, BAML and Credit Suisse expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore to maintain its appreciation stance at its next monetary policy meeting in mid-April."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This translates to about S$2,800 per square foot (psf), based on the total gross floor area (GFA) of 5,563.7 sq ft.Located in the Tanjong Pagar area, the shophouses sit on a site that spans 2,703.6 sq ft and they have a 99-year land tenure with effect from July 4, 1989. They are also situated near Tanjong Pagar and Outram Park MRT stations, and within the Chinatown historic district.Steven Tan, senior director of capital markets at Colliers International, said the firm expects \"healthy interest\" for these shophouses from both local and foreign investors. \"Singapore real estate remains appealing and continues to get investors' vote of confidence amid uncertain times. This is due in part to Singapore's strong fundamentals and the long-term growth potential of its property market,\" Mr Tan noted.He added that the shophouses at Neil Road enjoy \"strong tenant covenant and has the potential to increase GFA via addition and alteration works, subject to relevant approvals\". There is also space at the rear of the property for the loading and unloading of supplies, as well as the setting up of an alfresco food and beverage area, subject to approval.\"We believe there is an upside for rental revision, particularly in a robust leasing market with limited supply,\" Mr Tan said.The ground floor of both shophouses and the second floor of 67 Neil Road are tenanted to an entertainment establishment which has been leasing the space for many years.Meanwhile, the second floor of 65 Neil Road, which is vacant, will allow the buyer to revitalise the space. Subject to approval by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the second floor of the shophouse may be used for various purposes including a restaurant, clinic, gym, karaoke, student hostel and residential use.Under the URA's Master Plan 2019, the site is zoned commercial. Therefore, there is no additional buyer's stamp duty and seller's stamp duty for the site. The expression of interest (EOI) exercise for 65/67 Neil Road will close at 3pm on March 12.Separately, the three freehold shophouses at 7, 9 and 11 Jasmine Road - comprising a mix of two and three-storey properties - and an adjoining vacant land belonging to the owner of 11 Jasmine Road, have a guide price of S$22.88 million.This works out to about S$1,185 psf, inclusive of the estimated development charge based on the proposed GFA of 21,363 sq ft upon redevelopment, Colliers said. The shophouses may be purchased separately or collectively.The three shophouses and the adjacent land behind these shophouses have a combined area of 7,121 sq ft. Under the Master Plan 2019, the site is zoned residential with first storey commercial and has a gross plot ratio of 3.0.Subject to approvals, it could potentially be redeveloped into a building of up to four storeys, with commercial space on the first floor and about 16 residential units, based on an average apartment size of 861 sq ft.Added Mr Tan: \"We have been approached by several co-living operators who are looking for suitable properties to operate from, and we believe this site would be ideal for that purpose. The buyer can seek permission from the authorities for change of use to serviced apartments to tap the growing co-living sector.\"The site which is surrounded by a landed housing estate, is near the upcoming Upper Thomson MRT station on the Thomson-East Coast Line, and Marymount MRT station on the Circle Line.Amenities in the vicinity include Thomson Plaza, Junction 8 shopping mall, Whitley Secondary School, Catholic High School and MacRitchie Reservoir Park.The EOI exercise for 7, 9 and 11 Jasmine Road and the adjoining land will close at 3pm on March 19."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The rush to add real estate has led to a jump in upmarket housing prices in China, while offering some support for Asian property markets hit hard by the pandemic.\"It's been flat-out,\" said Monika Tu, founder of Black Diamondz, an Australian company that caters to Chinese buyers of luxury real estate.Since March, Ms Tu has sold A$85 million (S$78.2 million) of prime property, with about half the sales to Chinese clients who were in Australia when the pandemic hit. That's a 25 per cent jump from earlier in the year. The homes, priced between A$7.25 million and A$19.5 million, are all in Sydney's well-heeled, ocean-front suburbs such as Point Piper.A gradual easing of virus restrictions is making it easier for wealthy Chinese to view properties and complete purchases in nearby Asian hot spots like Shanghai, Seoul and Sydney. In another favorite, Singapore, virtual tours and photos have been enough to seal multi-million dollar deals, pointing to how transactions are evolving. That's in contrast to London and New York where real estate remains sluggish amid lockdowns.Chinese buyer inquiries for South Korean property increased 180 per cent in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, while inquiries on New Zealand homes jumped 75 per cent, according to data from Juwai Iqi, a real estate firm. Searches dropped 32 per cent in the UK and 18 per cent in the US.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.The high-end demand is bolstering prices in China and tempering declines in other markets. Prices for top-end homes in the four biggest Chinese cities rose 1 per cent in April, led by the biggest jump in two years in the tech hub of Shenzhen.Even in Singapore, where a partial lockdown remains in place, activity is picking up via online platforms. Three Chinese clients bought six apartments worth a combined S$20 million at Marina One Residences this month without any virtual tours, said Clarence Foo, a property agent with APAC Realty Ltd's unit ERA. One investor spent about S$12 million on three separate three-bedroom units in the same development, a five-minute walk to the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino.\"Some buyers may want to divert their funds to other countries as the yuan may be devalued further to combat the weakening of their economy,\" said Christine Sun, the head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee & Tie Pte in Singapore.Hong Kong SlumpHong Kong used to be a favored destination due to its proximity to mainland China and fewer market restrictions. But the pro-democracy protests have prompted many rich Chinese to turn to Singapore as an alternative, undeterred by the higher taxes. Hong Kong luxury home prices dropped 4.5 per cent in the first quarter, double the decline in Singapore. The new security proposal from Beijing last week has led to more concerns about capital flight, sparking a sell off in Hong Kong stocks and the dollar Friday.\"They view Singapore's property market as a safe haven because of its stability. It's a more regulated market compared to say Hong Kong,\" ERA's Mr Foo said.Outside Asia's major financial centers, inquiries are also rising. Malaysian real estate agent Zulkhairi Anwar, who specializes in luxury properties at Azmi & Co, conducted viewings this month with two Chinese nationals looking at apartments and bungalows in the US$2 million to US$5 million range in the capital Kuala Lumpur.The potential Chinese buyers, who stayed in Malaysia when countries started to close their borders, began viewing properties after Malaysia eased restrictions, said Mr Zulkhairi. He's confident the spark of interest will last.Cheaper Than Singapore\"I don't think the pandemic would deter the Chinese from coming back,\" Mr Zulkhairi said. \"Malaysia appeals to them because there's a substantial local Chinese population here, making it easier for them to integrate, and our luxury properties are still cheaper than the likes of Singapore.\"Affluent Chinese buyers are also starting to shop at home, where lockdowns began gradually lifting two months ago.Homes priced at about 20 million yuan (S$3.9 million) in the country's biggest cities have emerged as among the most popular since April, when authorities started to ease credit to help revive the economy, according to China Real Estate Information Corp.In Shenzhen, developers sold a record number of luxury residences last month, according to Landz Realtor, which tracks high-end sales. BayHouse, a project in the free-trade zone of Qianhai, sold its 135 units for at least US$3 million each. Demand flared up so quickly that an initial promotion with a free opt-out clause was dropped.Shanghai DealsIn Shanghai, demand exceeded supply by fivefold for US$2.4 million apartments at the Oriental Garden project south of the Bund waterfront promenade. Green Residence, in an upscale expat community, sold out within a day even though buyers were only allowed to view mock-up houses online.\"These buyers are adding haven assets through real estate as the economy slows and inflation rises,\" said Yang Kewei, a research director at the China real estate agency. \"They either think that property is the best hedge against inflation in China, or assume that authorities will eventually loosen property curbs to prop up the economy.\"BLOOMBERG"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Buyers are also being told that some developers may be even contemplating raising prices.This sounds counter-intuitive given that Singapore is staring at a severe economic recession and rising unemployment.It may be wise for discerning homebuyers to be aware of some of the things going on in the property market.These are not new - they first surfaced after the July 2018 property cooling measures took effect - but worth highlighting as some market observers say they have been at play behind some of the bullish sales figures being touted of late.The first is the practice by some developers of continually re-issuing options to purchase (OTPs) to buyers upon expiry - without any forfeiture of booking fees.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Typically, a developer of a private residential project issues an OTP after a buyer has paid a booking fee of 5 per cent of the purchase price of a property. Within two weeks from the OTP date, the developer has to send the sale and purchase agreement (SPA) to the buyer.Within three weeks of receiving the SPA, the buyer is required to exercise the option by signing the SPA and returning it to the developer.The purchaser has to pay the buyer's stamp duty and, if applicable, also the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) within 14 days of exercising the option (that is, the date of signing the SPA).The remainder of the downpayment to the developer - 15 per cent of the purchase price - has to be paid within eight weeks from the OTP date.If the buyer does not exercise the option by the stipulated deadline, a quarter of the booking fee - which works out to 1.25 per cent of the purchase price - will be forfeited to the developer.So what would make a developer want to keep re-issuing an option to a buyer upon expiry, without any forfeiture of the booking fee?In the face of a softer private residential property market, it helps developers to lock in sales early amid competition for buyers - and chalk up the requisite percentage of sales in their project by the timelines stipulated by their lenders as part of their loan covenants. Of course, good sales figures also help to boost sentiment in the property market, in turn drawing more buyers including the fence sitters.This sales tactic of continually re-issuing the OTP is more likely to be used by a developer for a project with a large number of units.What motivates a buyer to enter into such an arrangement?Typically, agents target financially tight buyers who feel they will lose out if they do not buy a private property now; these folks believe that real estate is an investment vehicle they must own.Some may still be servicing a mortgage on their HDB flat and be hit with a tight loan-to-value limit if they were to buy a second property. Or they would bust the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR).Moreover, Singaporeans pay 12 per cent ABSD when buying their second residential property.Taking a gambleEntering into an arrangement where the OTP is repeatedly re-issued allows a buyer to take a stab at clinching a private condo unit at a supposedly attractive price in the current market, while potentially buying some time to sell his or her existing home.Here is a pitch that some agents use to hook buyers: \"Mr Tan, you should be able to sell your HDB flat for S$750,000 next year; and then you'll need a loan for just S$300,000 to buy this condo unit.\"Why not just commit now, since the developer is giving you a S$3,000 to S$5,000 discount, by paying deposit of 5 per cent of the purchase price to get an OTP?\"In a few weeks' time when the developer asks you to sign the SPA, you can ask them to re-issue the option. You can keep doing this until one year later; if by then, property prices have already gone up, you can proceed to exercise the option, since you've obtained a good price, at a special discount. If the market goes down, you forfeit 1.25 per cent of the purchase price and walk away.\"Thus some agents encourage buyers to take a gamble on the property market by entering into such transactions.Ironically, agents don't get paid their commissions by the developer until after the OTP has been exercised, that is, the SPA signed - and the buyer has made the remaining 15 per cent downpayment. But tempting buyers with the re-issue of options strategy can quickly bump up the initial sales volume and hype a project.This can then attract more buyers, including those with the means to exercise the OTP within the stipulated five weeks - shortly after which the agents can receive their commissions from developers.When an agent starts talking with a potential buyer about the possibility of the OTP being continually re-issued, there is a verbal agreement that this can last for up to one year or in some cases up to one-and-a-half years - from the date of the first OTP.Though not illegal, the practice in all likelihood has the effect of distorting developers' sales figures - as there is no certainty that all of the continually re-issued options will eventually be exercised, whereas the impression given to the public in the interim is that the units have been sold.Facing pressureHere's the second strategy that some agents use, which is in breach of official guidelines.First, a little history.The July 2018 cooling measures hit private housing sales volumes, while leaving developers with a substantial pipeline of launches on sites that they had bought at successively higher prices during the land-buying spree in the preceding two years.As a result, developers were facing pressure to sell the units in the new projects on these sites. By that time, a consolidation in the property agency business had resulted in just a handful of big players. This put the agents in a stronger position to demand higher commissions from developers - of 3 to 5 per cent for new project launches, compared with about one per cent previously.To help move units, some agents started giving a cut of their commissions to buyers. This is deemed unethical. So some agents started to get around this by giving the kickback, dubbed \"cash back\" arrangement, via a relative or friend of the buyer to avoid detection. Of late, agents have been labelling these payments as \"referral fees\".Call them cash back, kickback or referral fees, such payments that are conveyed by agents to the buyer, whether directly or through third parties, are in breach of guidelines stipulated by the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) and will attract disciplinary action.Not all property agencies allow their agents to engage in this practice, though they risk losing their agents to their competitors who close one eye to their agents indulging in this practice.Giving kickbacks to buyers (directly or indirectly) helps boost an agent's chance of clinching sales.Developers could have achieved the same sales result by giving a discount directly to the buyer. But doing so would publicly erode their pricing power as it would reduce the headline price that licensed developers have to report on their housing sales every week to the authorities. The lower reported selling price may also lead to a breach in the covenants of the developer's loan agreement with its bank.However, when developers pay higher commission rates to motivate agents to close deals with buyers, it does not affect the headline price they have to report. In short, prices are inflated.This is the second distortion in the property market that those thinking of buying a new private home may want to be mindful of."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Soon after on April 20, the Ministry of Manpower issued stay-home notices to all work permit and S Pass holders in the construction industry, mandating these workers to stay in their dormitories for a period of 14 days from April 20 to May 4, Fitch noted.This effectively brings the construction sector to a \"virtual standstill\", as manual labour in the industry is almost completely dependent on foreign workers residing in these dormitories, the report said.Moreover, Fitch noted that Singapore's circuit-breaker measures have been extended till June 1, and believes that tougher social distancing measures will remain in place for workers residing in dormitories and at worksites thereafter. This would result in additional challenges for contractors and further delays in project timelines, Fitch added.It also expects the government to ramp up Covid-19 testing for foreign workers, before allowing them back to their worksites.\"As of April 28, the government has reported that more than 21,000 tests have been conducted on migrant workers, representing only 6 per cent of the migrant worker population. Construction activity is still expected to gradually recover in H2 2020, but will not return to 2019 levels this year,\" the report stated.Given falling foreign direct investments as a result of low business sentiment worldwide, Fitch expects Singapore's buildings sector to be harder hit than the infrastructure sector.\"While the labour crunch is expected to be experienced by all construction projects across the island, slowing investments in the buildings sector in late 2019 will translate to lower construction activity in 2020. We forecast the buildings construction sector to shrink by 11.5 per cent year on year, a drop of 6.3 percentage points from our previous forecast of -5.2 per cent,\" the report said.In particular, Fitch expects the industrial buildings sector to underperform the wider construction sector.Noting that the \"circuit-breaker\" measures have adversely impacted the finances of numerous small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Fitch anticipates that the level of capital expenditure by SMEs to \"fall dramatically\" this year, as companies prioritise solvency over expansion.Separately, Fitch expects contraction in Singapore's infrastructure sector to be less pronounced than that of the buildings sector.\"More than 90 per cent of projects are supported by the government through public spending, giving it counter-cyclical properties as it is shielded from fluctuations in business sentiment levels,\" Fitch said.In addition, the government's plans to continually enhance the Republic's transport system has generated a healthy project pipeline, of which a number of high-value contracts are expected to be awarded progressively over the course of 2020, after the Covid-19 situation eases.These contracts include projects related to the construction of the Mass Rapid Transit Jurong Region and Cross Island Lines, as well as segments of the North-South Corridor, Fitch added.LISTEN TO MONEY HACKS PODCAST"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

(Photo: Jeremy Long)SINGAPORE: For most workers in Singapore, it has been weeks since they last saw their colleagues, possibly even months since they set foot in their office.That may be our reality for a bit longer. Companies must continue to allow staff to work from home wherepossible, the Ministry of Health said on Sunday (May 3), even as the country prepares to reopen the economy and allow workplaces to reopen if strict rules are adhered to.Reinforcing the message, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said that same day working from home will continue to be the norm even as circuit breaker measures are eased.Social media giant Twitter just this week also announced they would allow some staff to work from home indefinitely.WILL OFFICES BE DONE AWAY WITH?Downtown office space could be massively reshaped by COVID-19.More than 80 per cent of the Singapore workforce telecommute today. Current demand has been culled, with knock-on effects for building management, mass transport and F&B in the vicinity.Yet the completed office space in the country increased by a net 33,000 sq m over this first quarter. Office rents dipped by 0.8 per cent, while prices fell by 4 per cent, as the islandwide vacancy rate of office space rose to 11 per cent, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority.There are opposing forces shaping whether remote working will displace the need for huge office spaces.On the one hand, working in the same physical location offers opportunities for face-to-face interactions and business collaboration, which have been cited as vital ingredients for creativity and innovation.Leases also create inertia. Decades of longstanding corporate practices cannot be easily undone.On the other hand, the advent of Internet, the smartphone and social media has demonstrated how technological changes can have irreversible and permanent impact on workplaces.After incurring sunk costs in retooling businesses that enable that telecommuting reality, and as habits surrounding remote working deepen, telecommuting may become the new normal, putting downward pressure on commercial real estate space needs in the long run.Proponents of remote working also cite boosts to productivity, deep focus and time-savings for bandwidth-starved office workers who now no longer need to commute on top of office rental cost savings for firms.DOWNSIZING OF OFFICES, OFFICE SPACE MOVING AWAY FROM THE CBDAfter the circuit breakers are lifted, firms requiring some level of segregation as part of business continuity plans may lower their footprint within the Central Business District (CBD) to reduce a high workforce concentration in one location and look elsewhere for branch offices at the very least, accelerating a trend already underway.For years, banks and financial institutions have relocated non-essential backroom operations elsewhere. Changi Business Park has been a popular area attracting many banks including Citi, DBS, JPMorgan, UBS and more.More mature districts, such asFusionopolis at One North and Pasir Panjang areas, are gradually evolving into technology innovation and enterprise clusters.Tech giants like Google and Cisco have moved into Mapletree Business City II. Plans are underway for more business parks. The Punggol Digital District, which saw its ground-breaking in January, hopes to draw cybersecurity and data analytics firms to NortheastSingapore.Even the big boys in traditional sectors have responded to this lure of office spaces outside the CBD. Oil giant Shell houses its regional headquarters today at The Metropolis at Buona Vista. Daimler Group has relocated from Centennial Tower in Marina Centre to Westgate Tower in Jurong East.Government agencies have also moved away from downtown. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) and the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) moved to JEM, while the CPF Board long sold its CPF Building at Robinson Road in favour of moving to Novena.Some will use the time to rethink office space design, taking a leaf from property consultancy firmCBREs book. They moved their main office out of 6 Battery Road to Paya Lebar Quarter and used the shift to set up a new living lab to showcase various \"occupier experience\" technologies to their clients.ACCELERATING REDEVELOPMENT OF CBDIf companies adjust their office space footprint after the COVID-19 outbreak blows over, landlords will be pressed to act. We may see the transformation of the CBD from a single-use district dominated by office use to a more diversified and mixed-use district.This change wont be out of the ordinary. Older office buildings along Shenton Way, Cecil Street and Robinson Road, once considered prime financial streets in the 1970s and 1980s, have been redeveloped into mixed and residential uses.One Shenton was previously Robina House, EON Shenton was previously Marina House, and V on Shenton was previously UIC Building just to name a few.When firms shrink their real estate space in CBD, landlords of old buildings will finally be nudged to pull them down and put up new developments, in line with the URA Master Plan that projects a shift away from office and commercial spaces towards residential and mixed use in that downtown core.DATA CENTRES WILL SEE A BOOSTMuch has been said about how COVID-19 has catalysed changes in the workplace but the trend of firms leveraging cloud technologies to store information, run software and base entire systems also deserves treatment.Singapore, the worlds third most competitive data centre market, has seen the growth of data centres supporting a rapid pace of digitalisation.Apart from negating the need for firms to build their own private centralised data storage servers and maintain a larger office footprint, data centres assure smaller firms of business continuity and minimisation of disruptions.Interestingly, Keppel Data Centre REIT, the only data centre REIT listed on the Singapore Exchange, has surged by 30.7 per cent, higher than the average market correction since the massivedrop in March.This recovery has been led by warehouse and logistic REITs with a 44 per cent increase since March. Meanwhile, stock prices of office and diversified REITs, on average, recovered by 19.3 per cent and 16 per cent respectively suggesting investors are still bullish about the future of workspaces.THE IMPACT ON COWORKING SPACES IS STILL UNCLEARWhat about coworking spaces, which have expanded rapidly in Singapore? After all, JustCo, WeWork and homegrown office providers have increased their footprint in recent years.Many have temporarily shuttered their common areas and shared facilities amid circuit breaker measures that require people to keep safe distances and work from home.Many commentators have said the coronavirus could kill WeWork and the coworking space industry, but I am less certain.When the dust has settled in a post-COVID-19 world, we may see some firms leverage coworking spaces for more flexible space planning and lease tenures.Coworking firms may also shift towards having a combination of private offices and dedicated spaces in lieu of the big, open-plan places that have come to define this sector.Meanwhile, landlords of office buildings, such as Guoco Midtown, may shift the rigid leasing model that locks tenants into a fixed space over a long lease term to one that offers flexible lease tenure and adaptable space.The pandemic has been a wake-up call pressing firms to rethink their business models. It may do the same too for landlords with large office properties in their portfolios.Downloadourappor subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:https://cna.asia/telegramProfessor Sing Tien Foo is head the Department of Real Estate and Director of the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies at National University of Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The Business Times reported earlier this month that the potential buyer is understood to be an entity linked to Saudi Arabia-based Olayan Group.In its filing on Monday, Oxley Holdings did not confirm whether Siriti R and Siriti C were linked to Olayan.On completion of the strata lot sales, Oxley Holdings will enter into a deed of rental support as well as an asset management agreement with the two buyers.Under the deed of rental support, Oxley Holdings will pay any shortfall from the agreed aggregate monthly target rent for the retail lots and commercial lots for two years.As for the asset management agreement, Oxley Holdings will be appointed for a $1 fee for two years, to manage and market for the purpose of leasing out the retail and commercial lots, and it will bear certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of its services and the operation and management of the property.Oxley Holdings said its aggregate liability under the deed of rental support and the asset management agreement is not expected to exceed 5 per cent of the total purchase price of about $315 million for the retail lots and commercial lots over the two-year period.The purchasers have paid deposits totalling $3.15 million upon the signing of the sale agreements, to be held by Oxley Beryl's solicitors as stakeholders pending completion.The balance of the total purchase price is about $311.85 million, subject to certain adjustments mainly relating to rental income and security deposits on the tenancies to be transferred to Siriti R and Siriti C where applicable, and will be paid to Oxley Beryl on completion.Meanwhile, the final completion for Oxley Holdings' sale of Oxley Beryl - whereby the former's remaining 17.65 per cent stake in the latter will be transferred to Golden Compass (BVI) - is expected to take place at the same time as the completion of the sale of the retail and commercial units.The remainder of the proceeds of the Oxley Beryl sale to Golden Compass to be received by Oxley Holdings will be about $200 million, less a retention sum for works after the retail and commercial units are sold.Shares of Oxley Holdings fell 0.5 cent or 2 per cent to close at 24.5 cents on Monday before the announcement."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Right now, it is barely showing a pulse.In a market where buying and selling individual floors, or even just suites in a building, can lead to quick profits, just three deals have been done in the Lippo Centre this year, with the average price dropping 17 per cent from a year earlier.The number of deals is down from as many as 18 in the first half of 2017 - the most active of recent years.There is no shortage of reasons for the downturn. Hong Kong is in its deepest economic funk on record as last year's investment-chilling anti-government protests were followed by the coronavirus shutdowns.Disquiet over China's national security laws has rattled the city anew, stoking concern it will lose its status as a regional financial hub and drawcard for expatriates.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.The dearth of activity augurs poorly for the broader office market, where these strata-title transactions for a portion of a building typically account for about 40 per cent of all deals by value. Office valuations in the city may slump as much as 20 per cent this year, said real estate broker Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).Prices have already fallen for the few deals in the Lippo Centre, with the average price at HK$27,380 (S$4,924) per square foot, data from Midland Holdings showed.With vacancy rates in premium buildings in Hong's Kong Central hub reaching a 12-year high of 5 per cent in May, according to JLL, investors are also wary of buying office space when there is no guarantee they will find a tenant.The Lippo Centre's strata-title structure, which allows individuals to own part of a property, along with its prime location and long-term tenants including the Mongolian and Brunei embassies, make it popular with property speculators.They can play the market without having to put together multi-billion dollar deals needed to buy entire buildings.The lack of transactions in the Lippo Centre this year is being replicated across the market. The city is set for the lowest strata-title transactions by both value and volume since the data was first collated in 2007, said Real Capital Analytics.A key reason for the downturn is the retreat of mainland Chinese investors, who have kept away since anti-government protests broke out more than a year ago, said Benjamin Chow, an analyst at Real Capital Analytics. Chinese buyers had been a major force behind the market's run-up in 2018, he said.The last strata office investment in Hong Kong by an overseas investor was struck just over a year ago, he added.While Chinese buyers have disappeared from the sales market, some financial firms are active in leasing space.CMB International Capital and China Minsheng Banking recently expanded their footprint in Central, said people familiar with the matter.

It was only much later that I realised what he was really referring to - I had overlooked the softer side of business transactions, which are human connections between people.\"This is especially crucial for deals and alliances. \"You may be looking at absolutely fantastic numbers and huge profits at the beginning, but if, somewhere down the road, you can't work with your chosen associate or partner, and the joint venture collapses, you end up with nothing,\" he added.The University of Canberra graduate with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Building spent eight years with two Indonesian mining and quarrying companies before moving to Singapore when racially motivated riots erupted in the country in May 1998.Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.Given his background in the mining industry - which consumed container-loads of oils, greases and fluids for heavy equipment every month - Mr Tan decided to enter the lubricants business. Together with his wife and father-in-law, Mr Tan founded United Oil Company in 1999.He remembers the journey as one marked by a lot of sweat, some blood, and occasional tears. \"We started as a small player in the market, and very few people knew who we were. For the business to break even, we needed to manufacture and sell at least 50 container loads of lubricant oils every month,\" he said.This meant reaching out to potential customers through a dizzying volume of cold calls. \"We were on the phone constantly, persuading potential clients, negotiating prices, dealing with rejections - that was our lowest point.\"Slowly, through sheer determination and hard work, things turned around. \"Once customers realised that we strive to give them the best value and quality in terms of our products, and always delivering what we promised, the business took off.\"Building bondsMr Tan focused on laying the foundation for United Oil's future by forging a bond with clients based on honesty and openness. \"We created a reputation for ourselves as a reliable supplier, one who isn't greedy, but fair in terms of pricing,\" he said. \"And we are where we are today because of the support from our customers.\"Mr Tan's make-or-break attitude also played a crucial role. \"If we think that something is worth doing, then we die-die must try our best to make it work,\" he said.Aside from turning the small family-run outfit into a thriving business, Mr Tan also dreamed of listing the company and diversifying its focus beyond lubricants. Thus, United Global - with United Oil Company, United Innovations Company and United Renewables Company as subsidiaries - was born.As a fitting culmination to decades of hard work, United Global was listed on the Singapore Exchange's Catalist board in July 2016.The group provides a wide range of lubricant products under in-house brands, such as United Oil, U Star Lube, Bell1, HydroPure and Ichiro, as well as lubricants for third-party brands. It is also involved in the trading of base oils, additives and lubricants. With an extensive network of distributors spanning more than 30 countries, United Global supplies lubricant products to the automotive, industrial and marine sectors.An ISO 9001-certified company, the United Global has a blending capacity of 60,000 metric tonnes (MT) per annum in Singapore, and 80,000 MT in Indonesia.It has put in place a three-pronged growth strategy. It plans to expand its existing lubricants business organically in the region, focusing on in-house brands and through partnerships that offer good synergies. It will continue to establish strategic alliances with its distributors, boosting its footprint in key overseas markets by tapping their expertise and local knowledge, Mr Tan said.The group is also actively seeking opportunities to diversify revenue streams. An example of such a diversification is its 2017 venture with Japan's M-TechX Group to make oil-absorbing, nano-fibre materials for a range of industrial and commercial applications. Other collaborations involve the marketing and distribution of the group's lubricant products in Australia, China and Myanmar.Expanding footprintLast September, Madrid-listed oil major Repsol acquired a 40 per cent stake in United Global's subsidiary United Oil Company for up to US$46.5 million. By leveraging Repsol's international brand presence to boost production and distribution, United Global is well-positioned to tap new growth opportunities, Mr Tan said.\"Repsol approached us in 2018 because as a listed company, we had strong corporate governance and a high level of transparency. Second, we had a good footprint in Indonesia, which was in line with Repsol's goal to expand in that market,\" he added.Indonesia, which accounted for nearly 40 per cent of group revenue in 2018, will remain the group's prime growth market. \"Our ambition is to be among the top five lubricant suppliers in the country. Indonesia is expected to see some of the strongest demand for lubricants over the next decade as the government continues to roll out infrastructure projects,\" Mr Tan said.Apart from South-east Asia's largest economy, two other markets - Vietnam and Malaysia - are also expected to enjoy exponential growth.\"Our vision is to build a sustainable business, for the common good,\" Mr Tan said. \"Other opportunities out there include renewables and innovation, particularly in the area of new technologies.\"The 55-year-old has another personal goal - to continue growing United Global's market capitalisation. \"When we first listed in 2016, my aim was to double our market cap in three years, but everyone laughed at me. In the end, I proved them wrong,\" Mr Tan grinned.United Global has a market value of more than S$140 million today, compared with S$70 million when it listed in 2016.\"My target - or rather my dream - is to double our market cap every three years, so that by the end of my 10-year tenure as CEO, we can see a 10-fold increase.\"Gung-ho optimismMeanwhile, challenges abound, not the least of which is the Covid-19 pandemic. \"What keeps me awake at night? This is one,\" Mr Tan admitted wryly.\"Our supply chain has been impacted - we haven't been able to deliver our fuel products to China over the last few weeks, and are seeing very slow sales in the country, as well as in Taiwan and Hong Kong,\" he added.\"Although sales volumes have fallen by about 10 per cent to 15 per cent, orders are still trickling in. We are monitoring the situation closely. Given our geographical footprint in Asia-Pacific, I reckon our risks are fairly well spread out.\"At the end of the day, when faced with circumstances beyond one's control, \"you should plan what you can, and do what you can\", he added.\"There will be opportunities that pop up, even in tough market conditions, such as acquiring companies with strong fundamentals at good prices, or sealing synergistic partnerships.\"That \"can-do\" and \"get-going\" attitude is what characterises the father of three boys, aged 19 to 27. \"I want to do the best that I can, as long as I am physically able. I push my limits to see how far I can go,\" he said.\"The satisfaction I get from building a business from scratch, achieving my goals along the way, as well as helping my staff and customers - no words can really describe that experience,\" he added.A self-taught calligrapher who puts brush to paper whenever he needs to de-stress, Mr Tan places a premium on doing good and giving back to society.\"I always tell my kids, 'Never be complacent',\" he said. \"I hope each one of them will be a much better man than me - displaying my strengths and learning from my weaknesses.\"This is an excerpt from SGX's \"Kopi-C: The Company Brew\", a regular column featuring C-level executives of SGX-listed companies.

This came as the occupancy rate climbed 0.3 percentage point to 89.9 per cent, fuelled by an increase in demand for storage while new completions were delayed as the pandemic impacted construction activities.Compared to the previous year, however, prices of industrial space were 2.7 per cent lower, while rents were down 1.5 per cent.Meanwhile, the occupancy rate increased 0.7 percentage point from the previous year, bucking the trend. Going by segment, nearly every one reported a quarter-on-quarter increase in the occupancy rate in Q4 2020, except for single-user factory, which was flat at 91 per cent.The total available stock in Q4 2020 rose by 38,000 square metres (sq m), down sharply from the average quarterly increase of 188,000 sq m racked up over the last three years. At 357,000 sq m, 2020 saw the lowest yearly increase in available stock since 2005.As at end December, around 2.7 million sq m of new industrial space was expected to be completed in 2021, with 43 per cent of the upcoming supply being single-user factory space. According to JTC, about 0.5 million sq m of projects were delayed from last year as a result of the pandemic.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.\"Delays in completion could continue for some industrial building projects, as the construction industry faces constraints on manpower and raw material supplies due to the pandemic,\" JTC warned.In Q4 2020, JTC allocated a total of 38,000 sq m of ready-built facilities (RBF) space to industrialists, which included 27,700 sq m of high-rise space and 5,100 sq m of workshop space.Total RBF returns in Q4 2020 was 55,100 sq m, of which 27,000 sq m was high-rise space and 20,700 sq m was land-based factory space. \"About 55 per cent of the total returns were due to natural expiries or companies consolidating their operations,\" JTC said.Looking ahead, demand for industrial space could gain momentum as the economy recovers, JTC highlighted. Still, prices and rentals could remain stable on the back of an increase in supply from new completions, as long as the recovery isn't derailed by a worsening in the pandemic.Tricia Song, head of research (Singapore) for Colliers International, said: \"We believe the overall Singapore industrial market will stabilise and recover in 2021, with some segments performing better.\"She projects rents for warehouses could increase by 1.3 per cent this year as the growth in e-commerce fuels demand for logistics spaces. Meanwhile, rents for business parks and high-spec segments are seen as recovering in 2021 after easing last year, thanks to improving business confidence and the technology, media and telecommunications sector.Meanwhile, Leonard Tay, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore, reckons that prices and rents for multiple-user factories are likely to face downward pressure of 5 per cent this year as government fiscal support tapers off since these are typically occupied by smaller companies. Single-user factories may do slightly better as these are generally used by manufacturers, he said.Mr Tay added: \"With the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, the city-state's strategic location and developed IT infrastructure would position Singapore as a key warehousing and storage hub. Logistics properties are expected to benefit, with price and rent increases ranging from 1 to 3 per cent in 2021.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The unit occupies half of the 22nd floor in a V-shaped office tower that rises up to 25 storeys.The buyer is a Singapore-incorporated vehicle owned by Wang Kuncheng, a Chinese citizen understood to be from Xiamen city in Fujian province. Talk in the market is that the acquisition is being made without any borrowings, and that the unit is currently tenanted.Mr Wang did not respond to queries from The Business Times by press time.According to data portal Handshakes, Mr Wang is a director of three Singapore-incorporated companies: V V Technology, Global Frontier Asset Management and Global Frontier Family Office.

It aims to \"establish a strong foothold in South-east Asia\".V V Technology has 79 employee profiles listed on LinkedIn, with about 25 based in Singapore and the remainder in China, including from Xiamen and Beijing.The office space at The Central being bought by Mr Wang is one of just four strata office units of 13,336 sq ft in the development.Far East in 2019 sold the other three such units - on Levels 23, 24 and 25 - at S$3,080 psf, S$3,150 psf and S$3,200 psf respectively.The remaining office units in the development are smaller and include loft units.Far East developed the retail-and-office project on a site with 99-year leasehold tenure that started in January 2001, leaving a balance lease term of about 79 years.On the website of Mr Wang's V V Technology is a post dated Jan 6 this year announcing the launch of a new talent programme called V V Galaxy, for both internal employees and external applicants.There will be more than 500 available positions under the programme, of which 200 are newly created, the company said.They include entry to senior management roles in business management and technology.Going by regulatory filings, V V Technology did not record any revenue for FY2019 ended December while posting a net loss of S$5.1 million, mainly due to administrative expenses.It recorded S$565,000 in revenue and a S$1.3 million net loss the previous year.V V Technology's sole shareholder is Global Frontier Asset Management, which has a paid-up capital of S$56.8 million and is wholly owned by an entity incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), called WKC Holding.On its website, Global Frontier Asset Management said that it is fully owned by its founder, Mr Wang, and deals with equities, fixed income and multi-assets private equity.It said that it invests in South-east Asian mobile and internet startups, in sectors including e-commerce, marketplaces and software as a service.The BVI entity WKC Holding also owns Global Frontier Family Office - formerly named WKC Family Office - which has a paid-up capital of S$500,000.In November last year, V V Technology was issued a Singapore travel agent licence, which allows it to provide air ticketing, tours, accommodation and visa services, according to the Singapore Tourism Board's travel agent directory.Property buyers from Xiamen and other parts of Fujian began arriving here around 2017, initially snapping up high-end condominium units from developers in the island's prime areas, said industry observers.A couple of years ago, they began acquiring villas in Sentosa Cove - the only place in Singapore where a foreigner who is not a Singapore permanent resident (PR) may buy a landed home, albeit subject to government approval.The Fujianese have also spread their wings to the conservation shophouse market, acquiring properties in locales such as Chinatown and Amoy Street, and, more recently, to the strata office market. Some are also said to be eyeing hotels.These Fujian buyers are typically in their late 20s and 30s. Most are not Singapore PRs at the point of acquiring the properties. For those buying residential properties, this means they would have paid 20 per cent in additional buyer's stamp duty on top of the standard buyer's stamp duty of up to 4 per cent.Some of these Fujianese have started to settle with their families in Singapore, and have also invested in existing businesses here and set up their own enterprises in a range of fields including management consultancy services, accounting services, information technology (IT), fintech, and food and beverage."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

If the rental income can be generated, there is good reason to invest more in real estate.Interest rates are painfully low though thankfully negative interest rates have not hit us in Singapore as yet. One struggles to get 0.5 per cent per annum in Singapore dollar fixed deposits and the Singapore Savings Bond pays just under 1 per cent per annum for a holding period of 10 years. This leaves investors, who are searching for yield and do not want to be too adventurous, with a headache.The perennial favourite, namely private residential property, has its allure. Private residential prices are rising and demand is healthy. In the last two months, launches of projects such as Clavon, Normanton Park and The Reef at King's Dock have seen good takeup.Singapore citizen couples can own two private residential units here by using one name to own one property for owner occupation while leaving the other name free to buy a unit for lease, without incurring Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty. The income from the rental unit can help mitigate economic or job market uncertainties and fund retirement needs.But finding tenants can be challenging in an economy hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic. The vacancy rate for private residential units is rising and reached 7 per cent at end-2020 according to data by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Rentals for private residential property fell 0.6 per cent last year.Investors who seek yield without too much risk may find a superior option in Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits), which have been popular since the first Reit was listed in 2002.Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.More attractive yieldsBased on recent trading prices, large Reits on the SGX generate an attractive yield of 4 to 5 per cent, compared to the net yield from private residential property of around 2 per cent per annum. These Reits trade at a positive spread well in excess of 300 basis points over the Singapore 10-year government bond yield.Certainly, private residential property owners can enjoy potential capital appreciation but so can Reit investors. A Reit that consistently grows its distribution per unit will likely see its unit price increase over time.Moreover, transaction costs associated with buying Reits are minimal and Reits are far more liquid than physical property.The professional vs the amateurPerhaps what is crucial in the fight to secure tenants is to see the individual owner of a residential unit as an amateur, and the management teams of Reits - in particular those backed by large property groups such as CapitaLand and Mapletree Investments - as the professionals.Retail landlords are under siege amid the growing popularity of online shopping, and challenged to come up with experiences to lure shoppers. Office landlords are confronted with shrinking demand as work-from-home entrenches itself.However, well-managed Reits are probably able to meet the challenges posed by changing needs of space users. Reits with large portfolios have the flexibility to reconstitute portfolios by divesting some assets. They also have the expertise and funding to undertake major enhancements to improve the competitiveness of their assets.Expect management of Reits to work creatively and tap large networks to lure tenants; provide high quality maintenance and property management to keep tenants happy; and study trends and mine data to position their properties to be future-ready.Active asset management will determine which properties thrive in an era where property like many sectors is being disrupted by technology. Trust good Reit managers to use data to better customise offerings to tenants and collaborate with tenants to create win-win outcomes.Choose qualityYou could get a decent yield and sleep easy while the professionals manage your Reit investment for you. Reits, however, may make cash calls. A Reit investor needs to study whether it is good to participate in a rights issue or preferential offer and line up the funds to do so.Investors in Ascendas Reit were asked late last year to take up a preferential offer on the basis of 37 preferential units for every 1,000 units held as part of a S$1.2 billion raising to help fund acquisition of offices in USA and Australia, and data centres in Europe. Investors who took up this offer at S$2.96 per unit, are now in the money. In contrast, the announcement on Dec 28, 2020 by First Reit of a rights issue on the basis of 98 rights units for every 100 units held to raise funds to help avoid a debt default has seen the said Reit's unit price come under duress.While Reits as an asset class can be attractive, like with all investments, be selective. Study carefully factors such as the track record, the sponsor, and the type of assets.For those looking at starting their Reit journey, one can build a portfolio by choosing two or three quality names that offer exposure to mega trends in logistics and data centres such as Ascendas Reit, Keppel DC Reit, Mapletree Industrial Trust and Mapletree Logistics Trust.Complement the above with two or three picks from among CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, Keppel Reit and Mapletree Commercial Trust, that offer exposure to quality assets in office and retail, which should benefit as the economy recovers. Case in point - Frasers Centrepoint Trust, with its focus on suburban malls in Singapore, reported that tenant sales are close to pre-pandemic levels for the quarter ended December 2020.Developers in Singapore have been innovating to deliver residential projects with a wide array of amenities as well as units that maximise efficiency and offer flexibility of use. It can be difficult resisting the emotional appeal of residential property.Reits, however, may prove a better and more hassle-free investment. But do not rush for the Reit with the highest prevailing yield. Having a high yield may be negative as that makes it very difficult for the Reit to grow via acquisitions. Rejoice in the year of the Ox by investing in quality Reits to overcome the perils of the low interest rate environment.The writer is a CFA charter holder with over 25 years of experience in finance, investment and real estate in Singapore and regionally"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

His suggested model emphasises the role of capital flows and investor types.To explain the compression of capitalisation rates, a popular theory is that when benchmark interest rates decline, future cash flows can be discounted by a lower rate, which results in higher valuations. That remained the conventional wisdom as cap rates continued to narrow in the Covid-19 pandemic amid ultra-low rates.But an analysis of US property deals and US-listed real estate investment trusts' (Reits) expected returns showed that higher risk premiums were actually offsetting most of the decline in interest rates, preventing the cost of capital from falling, Prof Van Nieuwerburgh said.The change in investor composition - and the different asset characteristics each investor type finds most valuable - may explain these higher risk premiums and, in turn, the strength in valuation ratios over the last two decades.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Speaking at Mapletree Investments' annual lecture at the Singapore Management University, Prof Van Nieuwerburgh highlighted the spike in cross-border investments in commercial real estate across the globe, including in the US and Asia, since 2001. The ecosystem of commercial real estate investing has also become \"much more diverse\", following an influx of institutional investors such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and university endowments.Based on his estimations of price elasticity of demand for US commercial real estate, foreigners came in at the bottom, followed by real estate PE funds, and then institutional investors. That essentially means these investor types are the least worried about overpaying for office assets.On the other hand, demand from individual investors was the most price-elastic, followed by local and national developers, owners and operators, as well as Reits. Being the most price-sensitive, they tend to walk away easily from assets that are too expensive.Geographically, gateway markets are the most sought-after by foreign investors, followed by individuals, institutional players and PE funds.Given these characteristics, Prof Van Nieuwerburgh's analysis found that foreigners had the largest positive price effects on gateway markets in the US, such as Manhattan, Washington DC, Boston, Los Angeles, Miami-Dade County, Seattle, San Francisco and Houston.Using Manhattan as an example, the analysis showed that prices of offices there would have been 8 per cent lower if foreigners had not snapped up the 30 million square feet of assets they have purchased since 2005, and if other investors had absorbed that space instead.Second-tier and third-tier cities, meanwhile, saw the largest negative price effects from foreigners due to a reduction in foreign demand for office space relative to the supply. These markets included Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando and Atlanta.That being said, the Covid-19 shock hit gateway office markets harder than lower-tier cities and the work-from-home trend is likely to cause permanent changes, although the extent of the actual impact remains to be seen, Prof Van Nieuwerburgh noted. How strongly foreign demand rebounds will also be key to commercial real estate's future price path.DBS Group Research wrote last month that the regional office segment appeared to be more resilient throughout the coronavirus pandemic, while the gateway office segment saw some hollowing out of space and an increase in sub-leasing.In Singapore, there was a particularly large reduction in capital flows from Hong Kong and mainland China in the first three quarters of 2020, Prof Van Nieuwerburgh said, citing Real Capital Analytics data. He pointed out that foreign demand can be \"very important\" for the city-state.If the findings on foreign buyers' low price sensitivity are also applicable to Singapore, the decline in capital flows would imply that Singapore commercial real estate valuations were under pressure, he said in response to queries from The Business Times.Several properties held by the three Singapore-listed US office Reits are located in gateway markets. Manulife US Reit has assets in Los Angeles and Washington DC, and Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit holds properties in Seattle and Houston, for instance. Atlanta, a less-popular office market with foreign investors, features in the portfolios of Prime US Reit, Manulife US Reit and Keppel Pacific Oak US Reit.To calculate the expected return on US Reits, Prof Van Nieuwerburgh's proposed model included commercial real estate's risk exposures to the overall stock market, bonds, small stocks and value stocks, and allowed these betas to be time-varying.The increase in these risk premiums also points to investors' frothy expectations about future income growth of commercial real estate, he said.Since 2000, US Reits' stocks have been trading at high multiples of about 25-30 times of annual dividends. In contrast, the Reits' annual real dividend growth was \"strongly negative\" at about -16.5 per cent in 2020, indicating that their actual realised cash flows were deteriorating.This \"stark dichotomy\" between robust valuations and low cash-flow growth realisations could mean investors' expectations are \"unreasonably optimistic\" and that the US Reit market and perhaps the broader commercial real estate market are due for a correction, Prof Van Nieuwerburgh said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The transaction was brokered by CBRE.The investment comes under Blackstone Real Estate's \"core plus\" strategy and expands the group's South-east Asia footprint, said Alan Miyasaki, head of Asia real estate acquisitions, in a press statement. Its \"core plus\" strategy invests in \"substantially stabilised\" real estate globally through regional open-ended funds.Blackstone Group plans to invest in more properties in Singapore. In response to BT's queries, Mr Miyasaki said: \"We're committed to expanding our presence in Singapore, and we continue to see compelling opportunities for high-quality office spaces.\"This demand is driven by a growing influx of global technology companies setting up their regional headquarters in the city-state, \"encouraged by the government's initiatives to create a transparent, business-friendly environment and build the best-in-class infrastructure\", he noted.The firm's global strategy is to focus on sectors with strong tailwinds. \"Our highest-conviction investment themes include logistics, life sciences, technology and content creation - trends that have accelerated over the last couple of years - and we'll also look to focus on these investment themes in Singapore,\" Mr Miyasaki told BT.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Blackstone has also observed ongoing demand for business parks that offer a \"unique campus-style experience\". Technology companies are keen to take up office space in low-rise buildings in business parks, and not necessarily skyscrapers in the financial district, Mr Miyasaki noted.He separately told Bloomberg: \"It used to be that the tall skyscrapers were really cool...If we can buy five more Sandcrawlers, we'd do that.\"Located within the Fusionopolis cluster in Buona Vista's one-north research and business park, The Sandcrawler sports a futuristic, horseshoe-shaped design that was inspired by the Star Wars series' giant fictional vehicles with the same name.CBRE's head of industrial and logistics Singapore, Rimon Ambarchi, who brokered the deal, told BT that the property is \"one of the best-designed business-park buildings in Singapore\". High-quality tenants are drawn to the building due to its iconic design and prime location, he added.While business parks are highly sought after by investors, they are a tightly held asset class and rarely traded on the open market, Mr Ambarchi said. This stems from a broader investment trend of surging demand for industrial assets since H2 2020, boosted by the resilience of the manufacturing and logistics sectors during the Covid-19 pandemic.\"This demand is expected to continue growing amid an expanding pool of buyers and a lack of institutional-grade industrial properties,\" Mr Ambarchi noted.The Sandcrawler was built in 2013 and spans 173,000 square feet of office space with state-of-the-art facilities and outdoor areas with greenery and walking trails. It also has a metallic external facade and a 100-seat theatre.The property houses global corporations in the technology and media sectors, including Lucasfilm and Disney, as well as Singapore's Government Technology Agency.BT reported in January that The Sandcrawler's occupancy rate was said to be in the high-90 per cent range, and market watchers estimated that the price tag reflected a net yield of about 4 per cent based on the building's existing rental income.The site has a 30-year leasehold tenure, which started from September 2010, with an option to renew for a further 30 years, BT understands. Blackstone did not comment on the land tenure in its statement on Tuesday.Blackstone is one of the leading investors in Asia. The firm said it is the largest owner of offices in India, where about half of its office portfolio is leased to global technology companies. And in China, Blackstone last year announced the acquisition of a majority stake in the biggest logistics park in the Greater Bay Area."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It also upped its special dividend to 29 Singapore cents per share from 7 Singapore cents the year before, on top of recommending a final dividend of 4 Singapore cents per share for fiscal year 2021, the same as last year's.The company does not distribute interim dividends, so for the full fiscal year, shareholders are being offered 33 cents per share in dividends, three times that of the year-ago period's 11 Singapore cents.The brokerage predicted that long-term investors could receive about 70 per cent of their capital from holding on to Bukit Sembawang for the next decade, as the developer utilises its valuable land bank.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.DBS estimated that Bukit Sembawang's 240,000 square metre land bank slated for \"coveted\" landed homes means the developer's shares are now trading at a price to net asset value of 0.86 times.

This venture could generate revenues of about S$11 million per annum, DBS said.This is a first step towards the company's plan of building a recurring income base - a \"welcome strategy\", the brokerage added.DBS also said that Bukit Sembawang's net cash of about S$300 million - which already accounts for paying the declared dividend - can be used to fund acquisitions. Assuming a target net debt-equity ratio of 0.3-0.6 times, the group has potential firepower of S$750 million to S$1.19 billion.Bukit Sembawang reported net profit of S$189.4 million for fiscal 2021, which was stronger than the S$76.1 million reported in the year-ago period. The results reflected higher profit booked from development projects, absence of impairment loss as well as lower borrowing costs.Its top line was S$581.0 million, 57 per cent higher year-on-year than S$369.7 million.Key risks ahead would be an implementation of drastic property cooling measures, resurgence of Covid-19 in Singapore, and a downturn in the property market, the brokerage said.As at the midday break, shares of B61 traded S$0.01 higher at S$4.96.

In the city-state, the balance of power is \"shifting back towards landlords\", the firm said.This comes amid resurgent office demand, tight new supply and the reopening of the global economy, said Wong Xian Yang, head of research for Singapore at Cushman & Wakefield.He also expects the amount of co-working space within the CBD Grade A office market to grow \"substantially\" in 2022 with the completion of asset enhancement works at 21 Collyer Quay, after having reached 1.7 million square feet (sq ft) or 5.5 per cent of total CBD Grade A office stock thus far.Mark Lampard, executive director and head of Singapore commercial leasing at Cushman & Wakefield, noted that the country's thriving tech and finance ecosystem continues to have a healthy appetite for office space as the companies expand headcounts.JLL highlighted the uneven recovery of the Republic's office leasing market. Newer, greener and better-quality assets have been more sought-after and thus led in rental growth. As employees return to the office, demand for greener, more sustainable spaces and healthy working environments has been amplified and \"are now of paramount concern\", Tay noted.She added that this has underpinned the robust take-up rates for newly completed projects, as well as the healthy absorption of space that was given up in good-quality developments by tenants following space-rationalisation exercises.For example, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp reportedly took up close to 70,000 sq ft of space at the newly completed CapitaSpring. At One Raffles Quay, L'Oreal moved into a 67,000 square foot office, which was released by UBS when the latter relocated to 9 Penang Road. CGS-CIMB Securities also recently relocated to about 38,000 sq ft at Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 2 that used to be occupied by Standard Chartered Bank.In 2021, leasing activity has strengthened since the first quarter of the year, thus fuelling rental increases. This came as the economic recovery and the roll-out of the country's Covid-19 vaccination programme stoked office occupiers' confidence, encouraging them to plan ahead for business growth as well as slowing business cessation and downsizing, Tay said. Delays in project completions due to pandemic-related disruptions, coupled with stock withdrawal for redevelopment, kept supply tight.According to JLL, rents of CBD Grade A offices posted a full-year growth of 4.2 per cent for 2021, far exceeding the firm's forecast at the start of the year, of a 6 per cent decline.The CBD Grade A office monthly gross effective rent rose to an average of S$10.23 per square foot (psf) as at Q4 2021, up from S$10.05 psf in the previous quarter and S$9.81 psf in the year-ago period. Rents had bottomed out in Q1 2021, before the quarter-on-quarter increases accelerated to a 1.8 per cent rise in Q4 2021, the fastest in 11 quarters, JLL noted.The recovery of office rents from the pandemic's impact spurred a flurry of activity in the capital market. Sales of assets with predominantly office use, worth S$5 million and above, totalled S$4.5 billion in the year to date, almost double the S$2.3 billion accumulated in 2020, JLL said.The largest deal sealed in 2021 so far was the S$1.28 billion sale of One George Street by CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust and FWD Group to a joint venture between JPMorgan Global Alternatives and Nuveen Real Estate. The transaction completed in Q4 2021. The price translates to about S$2,875 psf based on the existing net lettable area of 445,745 sq ft.READ MORE:Pandemic-wary workers to drive demand for Grade A space as they gradually return to officesOffice, retail, industrial properties underpin Asia-Pacific investment bonanzaCo-working spaces in the CBD to continue expansion in 2022: Cushman & WakefieldSingapore office market abuzz with investment sale activityCommentary: Making work-from-home work"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The CapitaLand difference is that we constantly invest in efforts to nurture business communities and innovation ecosystems within our properties, be they standalone buildings or business parks.\"Throughout our clients' growth journeys, we're with them every step of the way, understanding their needs and collaborating with them to provide the hardware and heartware they need to stay on top of the game in their respective industries.\"Boom in biomedical and healthcareWith the booming healthcare market in Asia-Pacific, biomedical and healthcare companies globally will continue to see Singapore as an attractive regional base.One example is German multinational company Heraeus Medical Components Singapore, which operates a medical wire production and research facility. It was attracted to set up shop here for a variety of other reasons, including the presence of many other medical device companies, the Republic's ready and available talent pool, and strategic position in Asia-Pacific to serve regional markets.The company credits its efficient operations in Singapore to its ability to house everything, from research and development (R&D) to the manufacturing of medical components, in its facility at 53 Serangoon North Avenue 4, which is in close proximity to Heraeus' regional centre sited at CapitaLand's Techplace II.Says Mr Eric Lee, managing director of Heraeus Medical Components (HMC) Singapore: \"With the growth of the medtech industry in Singapore and the region, HMC sees a tremendous growth opportunity which can be supported by this site. CapitaLand has been a key partner for us and has been working with us over the years on expansion plans.\"Opportunities in agritech and foodtech With Singapore aiming to have 30 per cent of its food sourced locally by 2030, the country is investing heavily in strengthening its entire food value chain. Prestigious addresses in tech districts are becoming highly coveted by agritech businesses wanting to attract top talent and provide an innovative working environment.Singapore Science Park is one answer, offering prime specifications and R&D labs for tenants to push the boundaries of food science. That's attracting the likes of indoor vertical farm VertiVegies, which is located at The Cavendish. Sophie's Bionutrients also ferments its ground-breaking micro-algae-based foods from its space in nearby R&D building The Gemini.The Covid-19 pandemic, combined with the rise of South-east Asia's Internet economy has led Singapore to aspire to become an e-commerce hub for the region. Fast-growing companies are hungry for office spaces that can help foster innovation and creativity - and e-commerce giant Shopee found that in 5 Science Park Drive.Located within the vibrant tech precinct of one-north, the 244,000 sq ft building with large floor plates gave Shopee freedom and flexibility to design the space to its exact needs.The firm created everything, from open offices and meeting rooms to aid teamwork, to Instagram-worthy amenities such as a full-sized gym and in-house cafeteria to make employees feel at home as they work.For a company experiencing meteoric growth, room to grow is key - and as the company hired aggressively during the pandemic, it was able to lease extra office footprint at nearby flexible workspace Bridge+.With delivery efficiency being a big part of e-commerce operations, warehouses - such as those at Changi Logistics Centre and 21 Changi South Avenue 2 - also provide facilities for logistics expansion and end-to-end operations facilities.Steady investments in semiconductorsWith the electronics boom showing no end in sight, the global semiconductor industry - a mainstay of Singapore's economic success - has experienced steady growth. Big global players continue to make Singapore home, such as AEM, a company that provides semiconductor and electronics test solutions.The company houses everything, from R&D and engineering labs to the manufacturing of equipment and related test fixtures and kits, at its seven-storey global headquarters at 52 Serangoon North Avenue 4, which it has leased from CapitaLand since 2005.Says Mr Goh Meng Kiang, vice-president of operations at AEM: \"This location is a very central spot in Singapore and while we used to have another factory in Tuas, getting people there was a big challenge. Moving here has made life much easier for our employees. We are surrounded by both public and private housing, and there is great accessibility to lots of food options.\"CapitaLand and its large portfolio of leasable properties has been a good partner in helping us with our changing space needs as we continue to grow as a global leader in test innovation.\"Your workspace, just the way you want itWith businesses expanding and constantly pivoting in today's economy, companies often want to consolidate their different value-chain activities under one roof. Corporations will appreciate the flexibility offered by developments like UBIX, a modern industrial development with a large contiguous floor plate that will be completed in the first quarter of next year.Another example is the Schneider Electric East Asia and Japan headquarters, which amalgamated multiple operations across the island to one location, at 50 Kallang Avenue.With a \"convert-to-suit\" refurbishment, it was able to bring together office, industrial and flexible workspaces altogether - all powered by 100 per cent renewable (solar) energy in the daytime.Intelligent environments for a Smart CitySingapore is emerging as an innovation hub, with its business and science parks, such as Singapore Science Park, becoming home to the world's tech giants. Beyond merely providing a workspace, CapitaLand also actively nurtures communities and builds platforms and ecosystems for workers to innovate, learn and connect to new opportunities.These include the Smart Urban Co-Innovation Lab - a new living lab within Singapore Science Park that brings together technology companies to discover, develop, demonstrate and deploy solutions for smart cities. Providing a platform for community-building, networking events, test-bed opportunities and more, the lab is set to benefit some 200 companies in Singapore over the next few years.There's also Catapult, South-east Asia's first shared executive learning centre, which provides training programmes on leadership and innovation to executives using new-age technologies like virtual reality, in Singapore Science Park and the upcoming Rochester Commons campus.Thriving in the right business environmentIt takes a winning blend of holistic and thoughtful work environment for businesses in Singapore to keep thriving.Having top-tier facilities that aid seamless business operations is key. But what is just as crucial is creating the conditions for organic communities to grow and flourish.Developing such dynamic ecosystems will help these businesses, and by extension Singapore, remain competitive.

The former is a reminder of Singapore's somewhat forgotten, humble past dating back to the colonial era and the latter the representation of modern metropolitan Singapore.The shophouse continues to steal the limelight from the modern skyscrapers, which have, for majority of the time during the Covid-19 pandemic, been rendered lonely, unoccupied monoliths. There was a signifi cant increase (29.9 per cent) in the volume of shophouse transactions in the fi rst half of 2021 in comparison to the second half of 2020.Key industry players have also indicated that the total sales value for shophouses in 2021 will likely exceed that of 2018, previously the highest year on record. This is contrasted with the falling demand for offi ce space in Grade A buildings, where vacancy rates continue to rise.So why does the humble shophouse shine bright as an asset class for real estate investors in Singapore? One reason is of course its rarity. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has only accorded approximately 6,500 shophouses in Singapore with conservation status, making this class of property extremely rare. Shophouses are only granted \"conservation status\" if they possess distinctive architectural features which are of historical and cultural signifi cance.Secondly, location is the key to valuable real estate. Concentrated in the following areas of Chinatown, Tanjong Pagar, Boat Quay/Raffl es Place and Katong, conservation shophouses are usually located within a stone's throw away from the central business district (CBD), as well as historic districts and gentrifying areas in Singapore.Due to their prime location and approved commercial use, conservation shophouses offer a viable alternative as offi ce space, especially so for family offi ces, a fast-growing trend in Singapore, and companies in the creative industries. They also tend to be near essential transport nodes and services, and the convenience that comes with a Grade A offi ce space isn't sacrifi ced.Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.The self-contained confi guration of a shophouse space is also attractive. This would explain the recent uptake in sales and rental volumes of shophouses located near the CBD and gentrifying districts in Singapore.KEY FEATURES: VALUE RETENTION, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, FLEXIBLE USE AND OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONSNotwithstanding the slight dip in average unit price of freehold shophouses during the fi rst half of 2021, prices are reported to still be approximately 59.5 per cent higher than the fi rst half of 2020, at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.Shophouses continue to hold value and maintain their track record of relatively high capital gain in the past 20 years.For example, we understand that a shophouse on Duxton Road was purchased in 2003 for S$800,000 and sold in 2020 for S$4.9 million). It is no wonder interest in this class of real estate continues to remain robust.Another key feature of shophouses is the fl exible nature of its approved use in comparison to the modern offi ce buildings, which are often single use in nature. A large proportion of shophouses, especially those located around the CBD, such as Duxton Hill, Tanjong Pagar and Circular Road, continue to be used as offi ces, hostels, gyms and food and beverage establishments.Then there is the ability for foreign persons to currently own shophouses which are approved for mixed commercial and residential use and which are erected on land either zoned for \"commercial\" and/or \"commercial and residential\" use.However, foreign persons (including Singapore Permanent Residents) are prohibited from purchasing shophouses which are erected on land zoned purely for residential purposes only in the Master Plan, subject to written approval from the Land Dealings Authority Unit.Despite all that glitters, potential investors are urged to do their due diligence before jumping in, as they should consider stamp duty, restriction on renovation and use restrictions.DUE DILIGENCEUnder Singapore law, purchasers of Singapore real estate (including shophouses) are required to pay Buyer's Stamp Duty on the purchase price of the shophouse or the market value of the shophouse (as determined by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore), whichever is higher.As shophouses may be erected on land zoned for residential purposes and/or approved for residential use, Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty of up to the headline 25 per cent rate would be applicable on the residential portions of the shophouse.Potential buyers should approach their property consultants to confi rm permitted restrictions on renovation. As conservation shophouses feature unique architectural features, which the Singapore authorities are seeking to preserve, conservation shophouse owners are required to seek written approval from the URA and the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore prior to commencing any internal and external renovations, additions and/or alterations to the conservation shophouses. This may range from the placement and installation of signage and air-conditioning units, to the external painting of the building.If the intended use of the shophouse falls outside the government-sanctioned approved use of the property, the registered proprietor may apply to the relevant government authorities to change the use of the whole or the relevant part of the shophouse.For example, the registered proprietor may apply for the change of use of the fi rst fl oor of a shophouse from gym and/or fi tness studio use to use as an offi ce space. The authorities have the discretion to reject such applications, and it would be prudent for potential purchasers to perform suffi cient due diligence before securing the sale contract.Offering the best of the new and old worlds, the value of shophouses may continue to rise even during an unprecedented global pandemic, reminding us that when it comes to investments, sometimes old is gold. However, in search of the treasures of our heritage, potential investors are advised to dig a little deeper beyond the surface to understand and/or abate any potential legal, regulatory or technical pitfalls along the way. w"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Direct real estate transactions year-to-date reached US$125 billion, just 6 per cent below 2019 levels.Stuart Crow, JLL's chief executive of capital markets for Asia-Pacific, noted that the commercial real estate sector in the region remains attractive and resilient despite ongoing unpredictability.\"Throughout 2021, investor interest in the region has remained extremely high as capital becomes more active and volumes approach pre-pandemic levels across the region, which we expect will continue into the fourth quarter,\" he said.For the third quarter of 2021, the investment amount was US$39.5 billion, up 10 per cent on year. However, transactions were down 23 per cent on quarter as several regional economies were hit by a resurgence of the coronavirus and subsequent restrictions limiting activity.By sector, office investments continued to recover and made up 55 per cent of deals, supported by stabilising rents and occupancy levels.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Logistics transactions also continued to climb with investments in the past 12 months reaching US$43 billion, compared to US$25 billion in 2019. JLL expects logistics investments will grow up to US$60 billion between 2023 and 2025 amid favourable demand drivers, attractive yield spreads and a desire for diversification.Meanwhile, retail and hotel investments have been soft due to slower economic recovery in the region amid Covid-19 outbreaks. JLL estimates hotel investment volume to cross US$7 billion for the full year of 2021, and rise to US$9 billion next year.By geography, Australia recorded more than US$6.3 billion in direct investments for Q3 due to large industrial and office sales.

Genevieve Cua asks the experts for their views and picks of top Reit sectors.Carmen Lee Head of OCBC Investment Research OCBC BankRetail sales at suburban malls continued to outperform downtown malls in Singapore as borders remain closed. However, the leasing environment is still soft, which suggests that negative rental reversions are likely to persist as landlords place priority on defending occupancy rates.Singapore Grade A core Central Business District (CBD) offlce rents have likely bottomed out, but Grade B core CBD offlce rents continue to show weakness. This could be due to a flight to quality, as companies which are doing well have locked in leases at lower rates. Rental reversions were mixed so far, but the level of enquiries is likely to pick up when restrictions are eased.The industrial/data centre Reits segment continues to do well, especially for Reits with data centre and logistics assets. The accelerated pace of digitalisation and cloud computing trends will continue to beneflt the data centre sector, while modern logistics properties are beneflciaries of structural e-commerce tailwinds. However, supply pressures are still high, with an expected increase in completions this year which is well above the historical average.About 46 per cent of the supply coming onstream in 2H21 is single-user factory space, and this is typically developed by industrialists for their own use. Industrial Reits are expected to continue to be the most active on the acquisitions front. However, competition for logistics and data centre properties has heated up, thus driving up acquisition costs and compressing yields, and making it relatively more difflcult to flnd highly accretive targets.The pace of recovery for hospitality Reits remains uneven, although more countries have eased restrictions in 2Q21. We expect the recovery momentum to continue in 2H21 with increasing vaccination rates and further easing of restrictions, although a more meaningful recovery would likely happen in 2022.Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.One key downside risk is likely to come from any potential spike in Delta-variant cases, which would then delay re-opening and economic recovery.We believe there are still selective opportunities within the S-Reit space. Given the progress in global vaccination rates (albeit uneven) and transition to an endemic era, we would look for a basket of reopening/recovery plays, comprising mainly retail and hospitality Reits. They include Ascott Residence Trust (Buy; FV: S$1.21), CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (Buy; FV: S$2.53), Frasers Centrepoint Trust (Buy; FV: S$2.78) and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (Buy; FV: S$1.15).As the situation remains fluid, we would balance our reopening/recovery basket with Reits with more resilient and defensive income streams that are less susceptible to lockdowns. They include Ascendas Reit (Buy; FV: S$3.83) and Mapletree Industrial Trust.The generally better-than-expected 2Q 2021 results season supports our view that the outlook is improving after the trough in 2020 which was brought on by pandemic-led lockdowns.Derek Tan Head of Property Research DBS Group ResearchThe Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the way people work, live and consume. It has also accelerated trends such as the faster adoption of e-commerce, driving demand for logistics properties. As companies adopt more fiexible work arrangements, the need for improved connectivity and digital solutions has boosted the demand for data centres, which many see as ''oil'' for the new digital world. We believe investors should invest along the lines of these structural trends.While the rebound in the economic and real estate metrics in 2021 appears to be on track, the growth momentum appears patchy given the rising risk of the Delta variant which may derail the transition towards a more normalised way of life and work.While Reits are expected to deliver a robust two-year distribution CAGR of 13 per cent over 2021 to 2023, growth is varied across sectors. Industrials and offices lead the pack, while retail and hospitality will see a more gradual recovery given more cautious sentiment amongst retailers and travel demand.Our preference within S-Reits is for ''structural growth'' themes of industrial (logistics, data centres) for their ability to deliver certainty of growth and distributions above pre-pandemic levels. We also like the suburban retail structural growth story, which has proven resilient given its exposure to essential trades and the ability to leverage on the work-from-home (WFH) trend. We believe that concerns of office landlords are overdone, as occupiers are unlikely to further tweak their operational layout with most of the space rationalisation unveiled.In fact, S-Reits have shown to be an attractive infiation hedge. The combination of ample liquidity, supply shortages and rising demand from economic recovery is likely to push infiation rates higher going forward, and we believe that real estate (like S-Reits) will be a beneficiary and an infiation hedge. We believe the market is already positioned for an expected taper from the Fed come 3Q21/4Q21 if infiation continues to rise, and we see a gradual rise in rates in 2H21-2022 supported by positive economic growth, according to our economists.We do not envision a repeat of the weakness that we saw in 1Q21, and expect it will not be a major hurdle for most S-Reits given (i) increasing confidence of a robust earnings growth of circa18 per cent in FY21; (ii) still attractive spread vs 10-year yields; and (iii) the ability to deliver acquisitions.A rebound in operational conditions, driven by occupancy and higher rental rates, is generating income growth. In addition, industrial S-Reits are in a virtuous accretive growth cycle as their cost of capital is conducive for them to pursue acquisitions. We believe investors will be compensated for interest rate risk, and can ride the trend of higher capital values.Foo Tsiang Wei Head of Corporate & Investment Banking, CIMB Bank SingaporeFollowing the circuit breaker and subsequent Phase 2 heightened alert, tourism-dependent sectors such as retail and hospitality have experienced a very challenging operating climate. However, with the country's high vaccination rates and the government's determined gradual re-opening of the economy we can expect to see signs of recovery in these sectors from early 2022.S-Reits with exposure to the retail sector should outperform especially those with significant presence in suburban retail as shopper footfall is likely to increase with the return of social activities and interactions. Suburban retail malls have played an important role even as WFH has become more prevalent, supplying nearby residents with daily essentials and groceries.Logistics and data centre Reits will likely continue to outperform as this sub-segment is driven by the favourable long-term growth of e-commerce and cloud services.However, we anticipate headwinds to remain for the leisure travel and to a large extent business travel. Hospitality sectors and Orchard Road retailers who depend on tourism may face uncertainty as the return of tourism is dependent on travel corridor arrangements.S-Reits with exposure to foreign markets that are recovering may present good upside opportunities, such as those in the hospitality sector that benefit from domestic travel and tourism. Globally, the landscape for offices has changed permanently as partial WFH arrangements are likely to be the new normal, affecting demand for commercial office space. However, we believe Prime Grade A offices given their limited supply in some markets are likely to be more resilient.Many investors fear that rising interest rates will compress cap rates, causing asset value to fall. All things equal, interest rates rise because the economy is doing well and infiation is accelerating. A stronger economy means there is higher demand for real estate, faster rental growth and rising occupancy rates.Rising infiation means increased costs, including construction and rental costs, which in turn will lead to a rise in property asset value. The same logic explains why property value doesn't increase with falling interest rates.On the income side of things, a rising interest rate does increase the cost of borrowing for Reits in general but given that most Reits are lowly geared compared to corporates, they are less susceptible to the impact of higher interest costs on their income.Historical empirical data from other markets show that generalisations about interest rates and Reit performance might have been unfair. Sectors such as logistics and data centres are likely to outpace infiation.Jolene Seetoh Senior Portfolio Manager, Pictet Wealth ManagementSingapore has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. Efforts are also underway to provide booster shots as the government resolves to treat Covid as endemic and reopen the economy and borders in a calibrated manner. Going forward, the retail and hospitality sectors remain poised to benefit the most as Singapore progresses towards full reopening.Singapore retail Reits have underperformed this year, as recent spikes in community infection led to tightening of domestic safe measures since May 2021. Restrictions on dine-in, fitness activities and a return to WFH slowed the recovery of the retail sector which was expected to rebound this year.Despite these challenges, well-managed suburban malls have demonstrated operational resilience due to significant exposure to essential services as part of rental income. The impact of this round of measures is also less severe compared to the 2020 circuit breaker, as more retail activities remain open. Food & beverage outlets were nimble in adapting to delivery and takeaway demands. Fitness and education centres were quick to switch to virtual classes while gyms also introduced outdoor training.While Covid infections have risen since the easing of measures, a rise in vaccinations and the overall modest severity of infection may see the return of confidence for people to return to malls and offices. Tourism related Reits such as hospitality and downtown malls have also languished due to continued border closure. The hospitality trusts listed in Singapore have assets in major cities around the world, standing to benefit from resumption of global corporate and leisure travel.Industrial Reits proved to be more resilient and outperformed in 2020, as stayat-home trends accelerated the structural trend of e-commerce and Internet of Things boosted demand for logistics and data centres. Industrial Reits trade at premium valuations and hence could be more vulnerable to rising rates. However, industrial Reits remained committed to acquisitions over the last 18 months, including overseas acquisitions and we believe this would underpin growth.In the face of a challenging 2021, majority of S-Reits remained focused on their strategy with asset recycling and acquisitions (domestically and overseas) and capital raising. Some also pivoted their investment strategy to enhance the diversity and resiliency of their portfolios, expanding to other segments including logistics and data centres in developed markets as well as longer-lease student accommodation. Such moves position the S-Reit sector for recovery into 2022 and beyond.S-Reits are currently trading at over 5 per cent forward distribution yield, and an above-average spread over the 10-year bond yield, implying attractive risk-reward for investors.Natalie Ong Research Analyst, Phillip Securities ResearchWe prefer the industrial and retail subsectors. Industrials were less affected in FY20, as tenants were less impacted by containment measures. A high proportion of light industrial, factory and warehouse tenants is in the essential services category, while business park tenants were able to work remotely. Although ancillary retail tenants were affected, they typically form a small portion of the tenant base. As such, rebates provided by industrial Reits were relatively smaller.This resulted in an early share price recovery for the industrials, allowing them to resume accretive asset acquisition, spurring more DPU growth. While tenants may remain prudent with space needs, economic data points to the expansion of the manufacturing sector. Demand continues to come from manufacturing and certain IT verticals, mopping up some of the oncoming factory supply. Biomedical demand should also help to prop up business-park occupancy.The retail sector will be the immediate beneficiary of further domestic reopening. The resumption of social gatherings and events will increase purchase triggers. As some landlords have signed leases with lower base rents and higher risk sharing, growth in tenant sales should result in higher variable rents for landlords.We are neutral on the hospitality and office sector. The hospitality sector faces a long road to recovery. While governments have been moving towards reopening international travel, mass leisure travel will likely not return until the later part of 2022. Some hospitality Reits have picked up assets in the long-stay asset class which should help diversify and provide stability for the portfolio, while others are taking the opportunity to undertake asset enhancements in this period of lower demand. These efforts should help accelerate recovery when travel demand returns.The office sector faces a structural decline. Tenants are still trying to find the optimal working arrangement and space requirement, preferring more fiexibility baked into their lease terms or taking staggered leases on their space. We expect office rents to be soft in the near term.S-Reits have been active on the transaction front. Portfolio reconstitution should strengthen portfolios while disbursements of divestment gains and contributions from acquisitions could help DPUs recover faster.Several Reits are exploring redevelopment and AEIs due to lower opportunity costs in this softer leasing environment. These efforts should result in faster later-period DPU growth.S-Reits under our coverage are expected to deliver 3.9-7.9 per cent FY21e DPU yields. Bloomberg consensus forecasts that 10Y SGS yields will remain below 2 per cent from 2021 to 2022, before crossing the 2 per cent level in 2023. S-Reit DPUs growth should stay in excess of interest-rate growth, providing upside for S-Reits."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Among the changes was an increase in the ABSD rate to 35 per cent for developers purchasing any residential property, from 25 per cent previously.In addition to the 35 per cent ABSD rate, which may be remitted, the non-remittable component of 5 per cent remains unchanged.In response to BT's queries, Redas noted that significant uncertainties still persist due to the pandemic, and the operating environment remains challenging for many businesses.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.The association reiterated its call to the government to differentiate the remission criteria for projects of different sizes, especially given the current challenges in the construction sector to meet project completion timelines.\"The property market should be allowed a bit more time to recover and reach a sustained equilibrium,\" the spokesperson said.Redas also hopes the government will consider giving some leeway in \"certain deserving cases\". For instance, some developers that were recently granted the option to purchase (OTP) for development land had been given a longer time to exercise the OTPs, on fulfilment of certain conditions precedent.\"We would like to appeal to the government to consider, on a case-by-case basis, allowing such developers to exercise on the date stipulated in the existing OTP, without amendment,\" the spokesperson said. If the period is considered too long, Redas suggested another 3-month extension from Dec 16, 2021, for the fulfilment of the conditions precedent before the revised ABSD rate applies.Meanwhile, Huttons Asia senior director (research) Lee Sze Teck noted that while the fresh cooling measures are expected to slow down price appreciation in the residential market, there is little pressure on most developers to reduce prices. This is because they usually have little to no difficulty to meet the 5-year ABSD timeline for current projects.However, moving forward, developers will be more cautious when bidding for land, which will have a trickle-down effect on land acquisition prices and tame the en bloc market, Lee said. With the 35 per cent ABSD rate, developers now face greater risks should they fail to complete and sell all units within the 5-year deadline, he added.PropNex Realty's head of research and content Wong Siew Ying said the latest property curbs are expected to slow the real estate market's growth momentum in 2022.In particular, high-end home sales will likely slow as investment demand moderates. Wong expects some developers of projects in the core central region to trim average prices by 5 to 8 per cent in 2022 in response to the measures as well as slowing demand from foreign buyers and the ample unsold supply in the region.Redas noted that it fully supports the government's efforts to help Singapore citizens and permanent residents purchase their first private residential property.The association also suggested that the government could consider allowing owner-occupiers who are upgrading from HDB flats to private property for the first time to defer the payment of upfront ABSD until 6 months after the completion of the new home, as in the case of executive condominiums.Its spokesperson told BT: \"Redas is of the view that the existing ABSD and total debt servicing ratio in place since 2013 remain a restraining factor for foreign buyers and Singaporeans.\"The new cooling measures also kicked in days ahead of the original launch dates of at least 2 new projects. Boldtek Holdings previously said that bookings for its 34-unit freehold boutique residence Zyanya, located in Geylang, would commence this Saturday (Dec 18) with indicative prices starting from S$1,590 per square foot (psf). However, BT understands that Zyanya's launch was rescheduled to Thursday (Dec 16), the day the latest policy changes took effect.And on Sunday (Dec 19), CK Asset's 230-unit freehold luxury condominium Perfect Ten in Bukit Timah is slated to go to the market. In view of the cooling measures, the developer is now offering a one-time 5 per cent discount for the launch weekend. It also released the per square foot (psf) prices of 10 units, ranging from S$3,200 to S$3,618 before discount, or about S$3,040 to S$3,437 after the discount is applied.READ MORE:Investors, foreigners, en bloc hopefuls to bear brunt of new property cooling measuresBukit Timah condo project Perfect Ten dangles 5% discount amid cooling measuresMND increases confirmed list private housing supply by 39% but clips reserve list supplyQuick takes: How might fresh cooling measures affect Singapore's property market?Government to increase BTO, GLS programme supply together with cooling measuresRedas calls for ABSD deferment for first-time HDB upgraders to private property"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The land rate works out to about S$1,440 psf ppr if a 7 per cent bonus on balconies is further taken into account, it added.Head of research and consultancy at ERA, Nicholas Mak, noted that the deal represents the highest price paid for in a single transaction for residential development land since the sale of a Government Land Sale (GLS) site at Silat Avenue for S$1.035 billion, or S$1,138 psf ppr, in May 2018.Announcing the sale in a news release on Friday (Nov 19), broker Savills Singapore said the transaction was sealed following the close of its public tender exercise on Thursday.Wong Swee Chun, chairman and managing director of Hoi Hup Realty Private Limited, said in the release that the firm took interest in the sites as they are 2 rare freehold sites in the east of Singapore.\"In today's competitive real estate market, we are very confident of the demand for quality freehold developments, especially for these big freehold plots in District 15,\" he said.Wong also revealed plans to develop 2 luxury high rise condominiums with more than 800 units there.Based on the land rate of S$1,440 psf ppr, Mak estimates the future condominium on this site could be launched at between S$2,400 and S$2,630 psf, after factoring in construction and other development costs.Construction costs have spiked since the pandemic broke out in 2020 on the back of a manpower crunch and higher building material costs, which is putting pressure on profit margins.Other freehold private residential projects currently being marketed in district 15 include Amber Park, Coastline Residences and Nyon. According to Mak, the median price for units sold at Amber Park, Coastline Residences and Nyon between January 2021 and mid-November worked out to S$2,448 psf, S$2,436 psf and S$2,317 psf respectively.Savills, meanwhile, noted that the development sites - comprising a total of 22 plots that are currently occupied by 5 bungalows and 10 pairs of semi-detached houses - are poised to benefit from their close proximity to the Paya Lebar Central precinct.The Paya Lebar Central precinct was selected as 1 of the 9 precincts joining the Urban Redevelopment Authority's pilot Business Improvement District (BID) programme to drive efforts in enlivening the city.Further commenting on the significance of the sale, Mak said the highest price paid for development land this year so far goes to the GLS tender for the Marina View white site located near the Singapore Conference Hall. It was sold for S$1.508 billion on Sep 29, or S$1,379 psf ppr.Mak also said that the current en bloc market has not really heated up yet as developers are selective.\"Furthermore, some developers are selective of their land acquisitions because if the market becomes too heated, there is the risk that the government will intervene with more market curbs,\" he added.READ MORE:URA awards Marina View white site to IOI Properties' subsidiaryEn bloc buzz is back; but some projects have cut asking prices"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Now that property prices have surged, even he is worried.FollowGLOSSY, cosmopolitan Singapore is playinghost to a very unusual balancing act. The city isone of Asias most expensive propertymarkets and at the same time, boasts one of the highest home ownership rates in the world.Liu Thai Ker, the architect of modern Singapore,is a big part of the reason why.As the chief architect of Singapores Housing Development Board,he was instrumental in establishing ahousing model that has underpinned decades of astonishing economic growth.The 84-year-old Yale graduate personally oversaw the development of more than half a million public housing units.Now, almost 90 per cent of the citys residents own thewell-designed, government-built apartments they live in. Since its independence in 1965, citizens have been able to buy these unitsat a steep discount, turning homeownership into a key way for Singaporeans to grow their wealth.But in the past few years and especially since the pandemic, which plunged the city into its worst recession Singapores housing model has come under heightened scrutiny. Surging prices and thinning profits are raising concerns about growing inequality among the citys citizens, and threatening to unravel its lauded housing model.In an interview, Liu explained how Singapores property market got to where it is now and how he sees it going forward.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Q: You were a student in Australia and the US, then you worked for the celebrated architect I M Pei in New York. What brought youback to Singapore?After the Second World War, both Malaysia and Singapore were extremely, extremely poor. And the environment was extremely bad. You could actually blindfold yourself and know you were at the Singapore river. Why? You could smell the sewage. Thats the Singapore we were in those days.I told myself even before I went overseas, that I want to upgrade myself. First of all, to speak English as well as anyone else. Second, I wanted to become one of the top students at the university. And third, to come back to help rebuild Singapore.Q: Three-quarters of Singapores population lived in overcrowded slums in 1960, when the HDB was formed. What was your vision for the city?I was trained with a degree in architecture and in planning. And I was very envious of the old cities in the West in Europe, particularly, and also Manhattan. Its very tidy, very neat, very easy to find your way around. I wanted Singapore to be as good.A lot of my ideas in planning came from the West, like thenew town. My job was to translate those concepts into quantifiable specifications. Today, we (in Singapore) have many highly self-sufficient new towns but in the West, I dont think I can find them yet. They had the concept, but they didnt have people to translate it.Q: Public housing often has a poor reputation, but thats not the case in Singapore. Why is the citys government-built housing so well-regarded?So we actually did not build housing, we built communities. For example, we broke down new towns into neighborhoods. And within each precinct, I wanted to make sure we had one- to five-room flats together. But not just anyhow. You dont mix one- and three- (room units) together because the economic gap is too big; it will create envy. You can only mix one- and two-room flats and then two- and three-room flats. So all these things have been built into the hardware.And actually, even a small thing like this: We used to have one-room flats with central corridors. After going to Europe, I realised that when we have a central corridor, theres no light inside. And when theres no good lighting, people get in a bad mood and tend to fight more. Thats why we got rid of that (design).It did not happen by luck, every little bit was a result of hard work and hard thinking.Q: How did housing become a tool for building wealth in Singapore?It was a gradual process. Im speaking as a planner, an architect. Im not speaking as an economist.The only resource we have in Singapore is human beings, and we have to look after our human beings to survive as a country. So, first, you have to satisfy the basic human needs: to clothe them, feed them, to give them housing, to have good transportation.This is very important. Because if you dont have a home, first of all, you cannot concentrate on your work. And second, our public housing (agency] is probably one of very, very few in the world that built housing not just to rent, but to sell. When you own your own property, you will feel that you have taken root in society. And you will also want to defend the country and help build the economy. So, homeownership is another very important factor in the success story of public housing.Q: Has the model workedwell?Is the public reaping the benefits?We didnt want people who lived in public housing to feel that they were inferior. So, we wanted their housing value to increase.One of my jobs at the HDB was to monitor the supply of public housing against demand, to make sure that people dont have to wait too long to get public housing. In fact, what we wanted was to have supply slightly higher than demand, so that people will not have to pay high prices.I do worry that nowadays that public housing has become a kind of business venture, rather than actually solving housing needs. I feel that the implication may not be very good for the economic development of Singapore.Q: Is Singapores housing policy still working in terms ofsocial mobility?As long as the HDB is able to control their land price and consumption costs, it can control the selling price. But Im totally out of touch with HDB, I dont know whether it is able to do that. If it cannot do that, then I think the key factor of having successful public housing may be compromised.Q: What are your proposals for ensuring Singapore has a sustainable housing model?Personally, I feel that our original policy one, to monitor supply and demand, and two, to build relatively low-cost housing is still valid. And on top of that, of course, to build highly self-sufficient new towns. All these things have respectively contributed to our economic growth.I would say, keep the housing price rising steadily and not in a crazy way. But how to make that transition I think we need some economists advice. Because now it has gone crazy. If you suddenly control it, I dont know what negative effect there could be. We need an economist to study it. But my wish is that we would go back to something more steady, so that our property prices remain more predictable.Q: Having seen Singapore develop over the decades, what are your thoughts about where the city goes next?We should be thankful that the first-generation political leaders championed meritocracy.Meritocracy helped us to educate almost everybody. In terms of the job market, the government also has been very careful in keeping a good spread of jobs for different ethnic groups. Even gender equality is steadily improving.When we first started, our economy was behind Manila, Yangon and Ho Chi Minh City, so we had a crisis mentality.

During this 4-year period, capital values of landed residential properties increased by 28.8 per cent, while those of non-landed housing climbed 24.2 per cent.Interestingly, it noted that the capital values of landed housing increased at a faster pace in the first 2 years of the pandemic compared to the 2 years before Covid-19, with landed home prices rising at a compound annual growth rate of 7.1 per cent on average in 2020 and 2021, compared to 6 per cent annually in 2018 and 2019.In the first 3 months of 2022, the landed housing price index expanded by another 4.2 per cent quarter on quarter.While the new round of property cooling measures in December 2021 brought a halt to the non-landed property price growth, the landed market segment emerged unscathed as the landed housing price index grew another 4.2 per cent quarter on quarter in the first 3 months of 2022.ERA said that some 2,113 landed homes were sold in 2020, a 36.6 per cent rise compared to 1,547 units transacted in 2019. In 2021, landed property transaction volumes jumped a further 74 per cent to 3,676 units, due to the overall recovery in the residential property market.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.With limited supply of landed housing in the primary market, more than 90 per cent of landed homes transacted were in the secondary market, with both segments seeing increases in the number of units sold in 2021. Year-on-year primary market sales volume of landed housing rose 157.6 per cent while secondary sales volume increased 71.6 per cent.Among the 3 market segments in Singapore, the Core Central Region (CCR) saw the quickest rise in the number of landed homes transacted in 2021, followed by the Rest of Central Region and Outside Central Region, respectively.The growing transactions in the prime areas underpinned the growing appetite among landed housing buyers who can afford more expensive homes in prime locations, said the report.Meanwhile, changes in landed property rental rates in Singapore were more closely correlated to the economic climate and the job market. The landed rental index contracted from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 when border restrictions were tightened and expatriate tenants left Singapore, leading to a decline in leasing demand.When the vaccination programme was announced towards the end of 2020, market sentiment improved, with demand for bigger homes contributing to the stronger rental appetite for landed houses.As a result, the landed housing rental index started to rise from the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021. By the end of 2021, rental rates of landed homes had increased 8.2 per cent year on year, compared to the 2.7 per cent contraction in 2020.In Q1 2022, the landed housing rental index expanded a further 5.3 per cent quarter on quarter, the highest quarterly rate of growth among all the property market segments, noted ERA.This could be due to tenants strong preference for bigger-sized homes, especially with the widespread work-from-home practice, as well as the limited supply of rental landed units.ERA added that residential leasing demand from local residents also contributed to the rise in landed housing rental rates, as the completion of new residential developments was delayed due to supply-chain bottlenecks.Looking ahead, ERA believes prices of landed homes will appreciate by an estimated 9 to 15 per cent in 2022, as demand rises along with further recovery in the Singapore economy, even as supply remains limited. This is because the stock of landed homes launched and available for sale by developers fell to a historical low with a total of 60 unsold units islandwide in Q1 2022, said ERA.There are an estimated 160 landed homes yet to be released, noted the report. The launch of these residential projects could occur in the next 2 years. The total stock of these 220 landed homes can easily be absorbed within 1 to 1.5 years. Replacing them could take longer in land-scarce Singapore. Among the landed residential projects that are yet to be launched, the 132-unit Pollen Collection at Nim Road is the largest, while Spring Waters Villas in Sembawang is the smallest with 6 units.A new landed housing development on the site of the former Caldecott Broadcast Centre is the only reported landed residential development in the CCR. Located in District 11, the site could be developed into 15 to as many as 26 Good Class Bungalows.With a limited supply of new landed homes in the next 2 years, ERA reckons about 95 per cent of transacted landed housing units will be resale homes. Meanwhile, the easing of travel restrictions and the expected resumption of business activities to pre-pandemic levels would attract more expatriates with large housing rental budgets to Singapore, it said. This would increase the leasing demand for landed housing. As the stock of houses are limited in Singapore, the rental rates of landed homes could rise by 10 to 16 per cent this year."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Two relatively large 99-year leasehold plots along Dunman Road (which can yield about 1,040 units) and Pine Grove area (which can be developed into a maximum of 520 units) fetched just 2 bids and 5 bids respectively - lower participation than what most property consultants had been expecting. SingHaiyi Group and Haiyi Holdings top bid of S$1.28 billion or S$1,350.50 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) for the Dunman plot, which is near Dakota MRT station and beside the Geylang River, was within the S$1,250-1,400 psf ppr expected by the market.The top bid for Pine Grove Parcel A - S$671.50 million or S$1,318.27 psf ppr - was at the higher end of market expectations, noted JLL senior director Ong Teck Hui. The highest bid by a 80:20 partnership between UOL and Singapore Land was just S$800 more than the next highest bid, by Allgreen Properties Pine II Residential - one of the narrowest winning margins at a state land tender.OrangeTee & Ties CEO, Steven Tan, estimates that the respective new projects on both sites could be launched at S$2,300-2,400 psf.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.Desmond Sim, CEO of Edmund Tie & Company, says the top bid for the Dunman site coming in within expectations is due to the higher number of housing units it can yield. The sites developer risks having to fork out 35 per cent additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) on the land price if it fails to complete the new residential project on the site and sell all units within 5 years. There will be no dearth of units to be launched in the vicinity with at least 2 big projects - along Thiam Siew Avenue and Jalan Tembusu on sites sold earlier - that could potentially come on the market before the new project on the Dunman site, mopping up a chunk of private housing demand in the locale, he added.Pine Grove Parcel A, because its unit yield will be about half that of the Dunman plot, has a relatively lower development risk. Moreover, there are not too many units in the launch pipeline in this vicinity in the immediate future, so the successful bidder can enjoy a first-mover advantage and has more room for a competitive land bid.CBREs head of research for South-east Asia, Tricia Song, too highlighted the lack of new supply in the vicinity for over 10 years. In addition, Pine Grove Parcel A is close to popular schools such as Henry Park Primary and a short drive from lifestyle hub Holland Village.JLLs Ong, commenting on the site drawing just 5 bids, said: It appears that many developers are even reluctant to bid for a medium-sized site like Pine Grove (Parcel A) which can generate 520 residential units.ERA Realty Networks head of research and consultancy, Nicholas Mak, observed: Typically, the sweet spot of residential projects for most developers is between 200 and 500 units. Projects ranging between these sizes would provide some economies of scale but minimise the risks of large developments, such as the 5-year sales deadline under ABSD rules.Mak also noted that few developers have the appetite for residential land parcels with price tags exceeding S$1 billion. Most developers, even those with strong financial capabilities, would prefer to diversify their development risk.Agreeing, Ong of JLL said that developers quest to replenish land banks could be tempered by geopolitical uncertainties, slower economic conditions, rising interest rates and higher construction costs. In the current market, URA (Urban Redevelopment Authority) should avoid launching large residential sites for sale as they are more risky and there is less demand. It may be more appropriate to launch sites that can generate fewer than 500 units, he added.UOL Group chief investment and asset officer, Jesline Goh, commenting on the groups top bid for the Pine Grove plot, said: Given the sites strong attributes, we expect to see keen interest from both homebuyers and investors.UOL is planning to develop the site into a 520-unit residential development nestled in the established private residential enclave near Mount Sinai Rise.SingHaiyi Group declined to comment on its top bid for the Dunman plot."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The guide price for the total of 22 strata units across the 4 levels translates to approximately S$3,100 per square foot (psf), based on the strata area, marketing agent CBRE said on Wednesday (May 11).20 Cecil Street, also known as PLUS, is a 28-storey Grade A office building along Cecil Street and Church Street, with direct sheltered access from Raffles Place MRT station. Recent strata transactions in the immediate area have all topped S$3,000 psf. In April, a 1,270 sq ft unit on the 8th floor of the same building, 20 Cecil Street, was sold for S$3.89 million or S$3,060 psf, while two units on the 6th floor totalling 2,626 sq ft went for S$7.98 million or S$3,040 psf. In January, a 3,552 sq ft unit on the 23rd floor at Prudential Tower on 30 Cecil Street transacted at S$11.58 million or S$3,260 psf. In the same Raffles Place district, an office unit on level 12 in Samsung Hub on Church Street changed hands at S$4,155 psf in January. The 20 Cecil Street space is zoned for Commercial use, with both locals and foreigners eligible to purchase the property, and no Additional Buyers Stamp Duty (ABSD) or Sellers Stamp Duty imposed on the transaction. In March, the Urban Redvelopment Authority barred strata subdivision for commercial properties in Singapores central area. Considering that the government has restricted strata subdivision of commercial properties in the central areas, this means that prime strata office will be limited in supply and increasingly hard to come by, said associate director of Capital Markets, Singapore at CBRE Joshua Giam. According to CBRE, the completion of Capitaspring has brought more tenants into the vicinity. Furthermore, with work from home no longer being the default mode of work in Singapore, CBRE believes that office occupancy rate in Raffles Place is expected to remain strong with a potential for rental upside as leasing demand continues to stay strong."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This was mainly due to the divestment gains from the sale of Millennium Hilton Seoul (S$496.2 million) and Tagore 23 warehouse in Singapore (S$27.3 million), as well as the total gain of S$492.4 million (inclusive of negative goodwill) from the group's deconsolidation of CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT), which resulted from the distribution in specie of CDLHT units in May 2022.Excluding the above 3 items, net profit for H1 2022 would have been S$110.3 million. The board has proposed a special interim dividend of S$0.12 per share, which is 4 times last years special interim dividend of S$0.03 per share.The S$1.1 billion net profit was the highest net profit achieved since CDLs inception in 1963, it said in a statement. The results translate to earnings per share of S$1.235, against a loss per share of S$0.042 in the corresponding period a year ago.Revenue was up 23.5 per cent to S$1.5 billion, from S$1.2 billion. CDL said the increase in revenue was mainly due to the hotel operations segment, although the groups property development segment continued to lead contributions.Tuesday, 12 pmGet an exclusive analysis of real estate and property news in Singapore and beyond.With the easing of border restrictions and supported by pent-up demand for travel, the groups hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) grew 110.4 per cent, led by the Europe and US markets, which posted strong improvements in occupancies and average room rates. However, the performance of the groups hotels in North Asia was still impacted by travel restrictions due to the resurgence of Covid-19 infections.CDL executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng said: With post-pandemic travel fuelling continued recovery, we expect hospitality to be a star performer for the rest of the year. As Covid-19 concerns wane, our hospitality portfolio will be a valuable growth engine contributing meaningfully to the groups recurring earnings.The group is also actively discussing share buybacks. At a results briefing on Thursday (Aug 11), CDLs group chief executive officer, Sherman Kwek, said: We are still putting the pieces in place. We hope in the near future that we can delight analysts and shareholders by buying our shares, which demonstrates that we want to own more of our own business, because we believe that our assets are undervalued, we believe our share price is undervalued. The counter is trading below its net asset value (NAV) and revalued net asset value (RNAV).CDL ended 1 cent lower at S$8.24 on Thursday. It released its H1 results before the market open. CDLs NAV per share rose to S$10.18 as at Jun 30, 2022 from S$9.28 as at Dec 31, 2021. Over the same period, its RNAV per share (factoring in fair-value gains on investment properties) climbed to S$16.37 from S$15.70. If revaluation surpluses on its hotel properties are also included, the groups RNAV per share increased to S$18.86 from S$18.61.Meanwhile, the property development segment contributed 41 per cent of total revenue for the first half, supported by well-sold Singapore projects like Amber Park and Irwell Hill Residences, as well as overseas projects such as Shenzhen Longgang Tusincere Tech Park and New Zealand land sales.Notably, this does not include revenue from joint-venture projects such as Boulevard 88 and CanningHill Piers, which are equity accounted for, the group said.Sherman Kwek said that the Singapore residential property market remains resilient, notwithstanding rising mortgage rates, citing strong household savings and low unemployment. His father, Kwek Leng Beng, too highlighted that property investment, when viewed with a medium- to long-term perspective for value appreciation, is a well-established hedge against inflation.The group will be selective in replenishing its residential land bank here. But the good news is that at least we have a good inventory and land bank to last us for the next 2 years or so, with more than 2,000 Singapore residential units in the launch pipeline, said Sherman Kwek. This reduces the pressure on us to have to engage in a bidding frenzy in order to replenish our land.In addition to building a solid development pipeline, the group said it will keep its focus on strengthening its recurring income streams. As part of this strategy, CDL is pressing ahead with building up its exposure to other segments of the accommodation spectrum, or living sector. These include the private rented sector (PRS); a PRS asset is basically a residential building with the apartments leased out individually. The group has been building up its PRS portfolio overseas, including in Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia. It also has a presence in other segments of the living sector, such as senior housing and affordable housing. In June, CDL entered the purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) segment, acquiring a 19-storey, 505-bed facility in Coventry, UK.The group embarked on the living-sector strategy in 2018, but still needs a lot more scale to achieve cost efficiencies, said Sherman Kwek. Building up a sizeable portfolio in, say, the PRS segment, will also open the potential of seeding its assets into a Reit (including possibly its sponsored stapled group CDLHT, which has broadened its investment mandate to include PBSA and PRS) or into a private fund. Investing in the living sector will open up more avenues for us and bolster our fund-management efforts, said Sherman Kwek.Giving an update on its plans to launch a Singapore-listed Reit holding UK office assets, CDL noted that market sentiment for initial public offerings of Reits in Singapore has been hit by rising interest rates. The group continues to monitor market conditions and will decide in due course on whether to proceed with the planned listing, it added.On a more positive note, the group is expected to realise a significant capital gain upon the completion of the collective sales of Tanglin Shopping Centre and Golden Mile Complex; it has held strata units in these buildings over a long period at low book value.Sherman Kwek also highlighted the groups own asset base, especially within its privatised hotel arm, Millennium & Copthorne, that can be used selectively as the groups future land bank for redevelopment. The group owns a sizeable collection of hotels across the world. For some of them, the highest and best use may not be a hotel any more. Or it may not be just a hotel; it could be a mixed-use (asset) or even student accommodation. So actually, we have a very, big latent land bank in our hospitality portfolio too, and thats thanks to our chairman for accumulating these assets over so many years, so many decades.In June this year, CDL partnered real estate investment group HThree to acquire 330 Collins Street, a freehold office tower in Melbourne, for A$236 million (S$226.7 million). CDLs effective stake in the asset is over 60 per cent via direct and indirect investments.."}], "max_tokens": 10}}
