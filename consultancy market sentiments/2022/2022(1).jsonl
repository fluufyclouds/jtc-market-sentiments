In 4Q22, 486,000sqm of new supply of industrial space was added to the market. This has been the largest quarterly supply addition seen in FY22 and the largest quarterly increase in supply in over five years. Total new supply of more than 1.3m sqm was added to the market in FY22 - significantly more than the average new supply of c.875,000sqm per annum in the past five years. Although we saw a spike in new supply in FY22, it was less than half the c.2.8m sqm in new supply that JTC originally projected at the start of the year. This means that some of the new supply in FY22 has been further delayed, with JTC now forecasting a total of c.1.8m sqm of supply to be delivered in FY23. A bulk of this will again come from the single-user factory segment (49%), while warehouse supply constitutes 28%, and the multiple-user factory and business park segments make up the remaining 23%. Although there was a spike in new supply in FY22, the demand of c.733,000sqm was relatively in line with the demand seen over the past five years. As such, the negative net absorption led to a slight 0.8ppt decline in the overall occupancy rate for industrial space. The negative net absorption was most pronounced in 4Q22, which coincided with the largest delivery of new supply in FY22. With the delivery of new supply expected to remain on an upward trajectory in the coming year, we could see further negative net absorption rates and continued pressure on the overall occupancy rates for industrial space (currently at 89.4%). Rental Index continues to inch up despite the pick-up in delivery of new supply. Despite the faster pace of delivery of new supply and negative net absorption rates, the Rental Index continued to inch up to 97.7. During the year, the Rental Index increased by 6.9%, the fastest pace seen in over a decade. Every industrial property segment saw an increase in its respective rental index, with the multiple-user factory and warehouse segments reporting the strongest y-o-y increases of 8.3% and 7.9%, respectively. What are we watching? Take-up rates of industrial properties. With the pick-up in new supply in FY22, we saw negative net absorption in three out of the four quarters last year. Only the warehouse segment continued to report positive net absorption in the whole of FY22, while for the other three segments it was negative, and the worst performer was single-user factory space (c.-442,000 sqm). Although the decline in occupied space was caused mainly by the single-user factory segment, we also noted that demand for the warehouse and business park segments slowed down in FY22. In our view, the slowdown in the take-up rate could likely be attributed to economic uncertainties and businesses delaying expansion plans due to rapidly rising costs as well as higher interest rates. Although we understand that tenant demand from the biomedical, precision engineering, high-tech manufacturing, and logistics sectors continue to remain robust, we are keeping a close eye on how sustainable demand will be as we enter FY23, with economic conditions becoming more uncertain. Historically, the logistics and high-specification industrial segments tend to outperform and remain more resilient during periods of economic uncertainty, and we are expecting this trend to re-emerge going forward. Will the protracted weakness from single-user factory space flow down to other segments? As evident in FY22, the single- user factory space reported negative net absorption for more than two consecutive years. Over the past 10 quarters, the negative net absorption was a function of the spike in new supply, as well as declining occupied space. With a further c.1.8m sqm of new supply in single-user factory space expected to be delivered in FY23 and FY24, it could put further downward pressure on existing stock. Although the anchor tenant rule prevents landlords of single-user factories to sublet more than DBS Group Research.

This is a result of a rollover in project completions from the last three years, as the COVID- 19 pandemic led to construction delays and disruptions to supply chains. * As compared to the start of FY22, it seems like the completion of c.1.0m sqm of new supply has been rolled over to FY23, even as construction delays and supply chain disruptions ease. * Slightly more than 1.3m sqm of new supply was completed in the whole of FY22. This was the highest level of completion seen in over four years. * Approximately 1.8m sqm of new supply is expected to be delivered in FY23, with the single-user factory space contributing 49%, likely to have been developed by industrialists for their own use. * Delivery of new warehouse space in FY23 will constitute 28% of the supply, potentially easing the strong demand seen in FY21 and FY22. * Multiple-user factory space and business parks make up another 23% of the upcoming supply. * Take-up of multiple-user and warehouse spaces has been healthy so far in FY21 and FY22 with positive net absorption, despite the delivery of new stock.

Spike in new supply in 2022 led to negative net absorption Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * Net absorption in FY20 and FY21 were positive due to the delays in construction and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. * Although the amount of new industrial supply in FY21 was more than twice the amount seen in FY20, pent-up demand and expansion needs led to a slightly positive net absorption in FY21. * The positive net absorption in FY21 came from the multi-user factory and warehouse segments, partially offset by the negative net absorption from the single-user factory and business park segments. * With the spike in new industrial supply (c.1.3m sqm) that hit the market in FY22, we saw negative net absorption. The negative net absorption was mainly contributed by the single-user factory segments, while the other segments like warehouse and business parks reported a slowdown in take-up. * In the medium term, we expect net absorption to continue to stay in negative territory, leading to the softening of occupancy and rental rates, unless demand in FY23 surprises on the upside. 11.1% 10.7% 10.8% 10.1% 9.8% 10.6% 11.1% 11.4% 5.0% 6.0% 7.0% 8.0% 9.0% 10.0% 11.0% 12.0% (8.0) (6.0) (4.0) (2.0) - 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F m' sqft Net Absorption Rate Market Vacancy Rate (%) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 6 .

However, we expect the trend to reverse in FY23 due to limited new supply. * The positive rental reversion cycle continued into FY22 for the warehouse and factory segments, owing to strong demand, despite the pick-up in the increase of new supply. * Overall rentals in the near term are expected to continue to remain healthy, even as more new supply is expected to come online. * Over the last two years, the logistics sector has been driven by the advancement of e-commerce and stockpiling activities.

Industrial Sub-sector - Multi-User Factory Multi-user factory supply: Supply spike in 2022 due to construction delays in previous two years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * New completions picked up in FY22 after more than three years of construction delays. A total of 634,000sqm of new supply of multi-user factory space was delivered in FY22, the largest increase in annual supply in over a decade. * Despite the spike in supply, take-up of multi-user factory space was very strong. A total of 442,000sqm of space was taken up in FY22, thereby cushioning the increase in the vacancy rate. The vacancy rate in FY22 was 10.9%, only a 100bps increase. * The sudden spike in both supply and demand in FY22 was likely a result of construction delays over the past three years and pent-up demand from businesses waiting to occupy the newly completed projects. Although we saw a slight increase in vacancy rates in FY22, overall occupancy is still at a very healthy level, the strongest seen in over a decade. * We are expecting another year of healthy supply for the multi-user factory space, with an estimated 322,000sqm of new supply projected to come online in FY23. Demand is also expected to taper off, as we believe most of the pent-up demand has already been satisfied. * We could see a slight increase in vacancy rates unless demand picks up and available stock is backfilled at a faster pace. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023F 2024F 2025F '000 Sqm Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 8 . Multi-user factories: Surprise rebound in occupancy rate despite delivery of more stock Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * Rentals surprised on the upside with a c.6.9% increase despite the spike in new supply delivered. This was likely due to cost inflation as well as higher rents that the newer multi-user factory commands. * As anticipated, occupancy rates dipped slightly due to the spike in delivery of new supply. Occupancy rates dipped 110bps in FY22 to c.89.1%, but this is still at a multi-year high. Aside from the past three years (where new supply was constrained by construction delays), occupancy rates are currently at a level last seen in FY13. * We expect some downward pressure in occupancy rates going ahead, as the market has to gradually backfill the bumper crop of new supply in FY22. Rents could also see some downward pressure, but we believe it will remain relatively sticky in the near term. * However, occupancy and rents could surprise on the upside if there is any further slowdown in construction, and new supply continues to be rolled over to the following years. 85% 86% 87% 88% 89% 90% 91% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023f 2024f 2025f 1Q18 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 S$ psf pm Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 9 .

Insights & recommendations * Notwithstanding a slight drop in overall occupancy from 89.7% in Q3 2022 to 89.4% this quarter, both the JTC industrial price and rental indices continued their ninth consecutive quarter of growth. * The rental index rose by 2.1% q-o-q, maintaining its pace last quarter. This marks a 6.9% annual growth for 2022, making it the fastest y-o-y rental growth since Q3 2013. The price index rose by 1.7% q-o-q, easing from the 2.0% q-o-q growth last quarter. This marks a 8.5% annual growth for 2022 and would make it the fastest y- o-y price growth since Q2 2013. * Colliers expects rental growth to moderate to between 1 to 3% for this 2023. On the other hand, industrial prices could increase at a higher clip of between 3 to 5% due to sustained interest in industrial assets with their higher yields and limited availability. There should also be more sale and leaseback activities as companies look to free up some capital.

This also makes multiple-user factories stand out as the segment with the highest rental growth, as occupiers seek office grade industrial spaces. However, the rental growth and demand for factories is likely to slow on the back of a weaker manufacturing outlook and a higher supply pipeline. Nevertheless, there will continue to be new biomedical and semi- conductor facilities, on the back of government efforts to attract multi-nationals to set up their manufacturing hubs in Singapore. 2 All Industrial Property The slight drop in overall occupancy of 0.3% in Q4 2022 was due to the pickup in new completions. This led to new supply exceeding new demand, with new supply coming in at 5.24 mil sf, (the largest quarterly increase since Q4 2017), while net demand came in at just 2.89 mil sf. The same narrative applies for full year 2022, where total supply (14.12 mil sf) exceeded total demand (7.89 mil sf). Warehouse Warehouses registered an annual rental increase of 7.9%, with occupancy tightening to 91.7% from 90.8% in the previous quarter. Colliers has observed that the demand for warehouse space has not abated, supported by end-users, third-party logistics players and food manufacturers. Specifically for prime logistics and temperature-controlled warehouses, there is a shortage of suitable stock to meet demand. As such, prime logistics rents are set to continue their steady climb on the back of limited supply and strong pre- leasing rates for this upcoming supply. Business Parks Business parks rents have started to exhibit some sustained growth, despite higher supply and vacancy rates. Newer, higher specification developments in the city fringe are still observed to have tighter vacancies and resilient rents. This has led to some occupiers moving to business parks further away to reduce operating costs. Over the next few years, rents and occupancies are likely to be dampened by a significant supply coming onstream, coupled with weakening demand, particularly from the tech sector.

The warehouse segment might be an exception to this trend, as there appears to be a dearth of supply post 2024, and where pre- commitment to existing pipeline supply is high. Economic indicators such as Singapore's manufacturing output, NODX and PMI are collectively pointing towards a manufacturing slowdown and weaker demand. Against the backdrop of inflationary pressures and rising interest rates which lead to higher capital costs, sentiments will inevitably be affected, leading to more industrialists becoming more cautious about their leasing plans. On the other hand, as some companies will want to free up capital, they might turn to leasing instead of acquiring or owning their own industrial space. Consequently, Colliers expects rental growth to moderate to between 1 to 3% for 2023, though warehouse rents might continue to outperform on the back of tight supply. On the other hand, industrial prices could grow at a faster pace of between 3 to 5% on the back of growing interest in industrial assets due to their higher yields and limited availability. 0.40 18.9 18.0 1.4 4.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0 18.0 20.0 2023F 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F Estimated GFA (mil sf) Warehouse Business Park Single-user Factory Multi-user Factory \"The consistent growth in rents has attracted institutional investors looking for higher yields, propping up demand for industrial assets.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast A Slower 2023 Singapore's economy grew by 3.8% yoy in 2022, significantly lower than 2021's growth of 7.6%, according to advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade & Industry. Q4 2022 GDP growth slowed to 2.2% yoy, as compared to 4.2% yoy growth in the prior quarter. The slowdown was due to a contraction of the manufacturing sector, weighed down by lower output from the electronics, chemicals and biomedical manufacturing clusters after robust growth in 2021. Nonetheless, wholesale & retail trade and transportation & storage sectors continued to grow by 2.3% yoy in Q4 2022. Given a darkening economic outlook amidst persistent inflation pressures and higher interest rates, Singapore's economy is forecast to grow by 0.5% to 2.5% in 2023. While the United States and Europe, Singapore's key trading partners, heads towards an economic slowdown, the re-opening of China could provide a surprise on the upside for Singapore's economic growth. Performance Continues to Bifurcate Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, rentals across most industrial asset classes remained stable during the last quarter of this year, except for business park and high-tech space which rose. Both city-fringe and outlying business park rents went up in Q4 2022 with the former experiencing higher growth rate due to relatively tight vacancy rates. Landlords have also increased their rent expectations due to higher property operating costs. Similarly, high-tech rents inched up by 0.4% q-o-q as leasing demand was supported by high-value manufacturing sectors as well as some spillover demand from CBD office market. For the whole of 2022, prime logistics outperformed, enjoying highest rental growth of around 6%, bolstered by digital transformation, e- commerce and inventory stockpiling, while other segments also experienced steady growth. However, a weaker economic outlook and sharp rent increases in prior years would lead to increasing tenant resistance and slower rental growth in 2023. Performance across industrial property types is expected to bifurcate. New economy assets such as prime logistics, high-tech warehouses and city-fringe business parks are expected to outperform, with full year rent growth of 1.5%-3% in 2023 amidst tight supply conditions and resilient long-term demand from e-commerce, life science and technology. Conventional factories and outlying business parks are expected to see slower growth of up to 1.0% next year, given a higher supply pipeline. Nonetheless, those newer and higher spec developments would outperform older stock.

Based on the Economic Survey, the Singapore economy expanded by 4.2% y-o-y in Q3 2022, a slight moderation from the previous 4.7% y-o-y growth in Q2. Nevertheless, as recession fears grow, the outlook has clouded business sentiments. After eight quarters of consecutive quarterly GDP growth in the manufacturing sector, with expansions above the 5% level, the increase in Q3 was markedly less pronounced and substantially slower at 1.4% while a negative 3.0% was recorded in Q4 2022. The drop in global demand for semiconductors impacted the electronics segment, and overall declines in the chemicals and biomedical clusters stymied growth in the second half of the year. As risks stemming from economic headwinds mount, business sentiments in the manufacturing sector remained negative for the period October 2022 to March 2023 according to the Singstat Q4 2022 Business Expectations Survey. In contrast to the previous period (July to December 2022), when a net weighted balance of 8% of manufacturing firms anticipated a less favourable business outlook, this percentage rose to 20% in the latest survey as the industry remains beset by continued supply chain disruptions and a prolonged Ukraine-Russia conflict. Accordingly, the contraction in the overall Singapore Purchasing 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in October and November 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against July and August 2022) and y-o-y (against October and November 2021). Knight Frank Research Reports are available at knightfrank.com.sg/research Manager's Index (PMI) that began in September 2022 continued at 49.7 in October, 49.8 in November and 49.7 again in December 2022. Fewer deals transacted in Q4 Led by a hazier economic outlook and the dampening of business sentiments, industrial sales in the final quarter came up to S$715.1 million, the lowest since Q2 2020 when sales grossed some S$324.8 million due to the onset of the pandemic. Apart from the major sales of a two-storey ramp-up warehouse, Enterprise Logistics Centre, in Tuas for S$120.6 million in November, and 10 and 12 Mandai Estate for S$100 million in December, about 97.2% of the caveats lodged in Q4 2022 were deals below S$10 million. Industrial space owners are increasingly adopting a cautious stance, with expansion plans placed on hold until there is more clarity in the unfolding global economic situation. With the flow of material for production inconsistent, businesses related to electronics do not expect improvement until after mid-2023. While sales activity slowed, leasing transactions remained relatively stable in the months of October and November 2022 with businesses in general manufacturing, construction-related manufacturing, transport engineering and precision engineering continuing to expand cautiously. The median rent for multiple-user factories increased by 8.7% y-o-y to S$1.94 psf pm with 1,571 tenancies.

And although manufacturing FAI dropped significantly to S$411 million in Q3 2022 from the S$3.6 billion in Q2 2022, pharmaceutical facilities, semi-conductor production plants and data centres are being constructed in the industrial supply pipeline. During the quarter, semi-conductor companies Applied Materials announced a S$600 million 700,000 sf plant in Tampines Industrial Crescent to be ready in 2024 that would double its manufacturing presence in Singapore, while Soitec broke ground on a S$571 million extension to its Wafer Fab Park in Pasir Ris. Singapore will also have five new vaccine producing facilities, set up by pharmaceutical firms Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sanofi, BioNTech, Hilleman Laboratories and MSD. Additionally, data centre operators Digital Realty and Equinix were reported to be looking to expand in Singapore by applying to develop new data centres, after a moratorium issued in 2019 to pause the release of land for data centre use was lifted. Market outlook The manufacturing and industrial real-estate outlook turned cautious in the latter half of 2022 due to rising interest rates, continued global supply disruptions and the challenging times faced for the technology sector. Even though the electronics sector is going through a rough patch, investments continue to flow into Singapore with the belief that growth will return and be sustainable in the long-run. These in turn create demand for local Singapore enterprises. As such, industrial prices and rents will remain stable with a marginal growth of 1% to 3% for the whole of 2023. In the logistics segment, where supply is tight, rents for quality warehouse space might increase by a higher 3% to 5% in the year ahead.

Growth in the fi nal quarter was largely attributed to the expansion in the construction sector and services producing industries. The manufacturing sector however, contracted from the output decline in the biomedical manufacturing, chemicals, electronics and general manufacturing clusters. As such, Singapore's economy expanded 3.6% for the whole of 2022, down from the 8.9% in 2021, when Singapore emerged from the economic slump in 2020 due to the pandemic. The manufacturing and construction sectors, along with the services producing industries recorded YoY growth of 2.5%, 6.7% and 4.8% respectively. For the manufacturing sector, all clusters expanded, except for the chemicals and biomedical manufacturing clusters. From September 2022, when overall factory activity began contracting, the weaker sentiments in the manufacturing sector persisted arising from weaker global demand and a slowdown in the global economy. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remained in the contraction territory for the fourth consecutive month, with the PMI declining marginally by 0.1 point to 49.7 in December 2022. The negative sentiments in the manufacturing sector was also felt with the continual contraction in Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX), which fell further by 20.6% YoY in December 2022. RENTAL MARKET Leasing volume1 continued trending downward in Q4, albeit at a moderated pace at 3.5% YoY, bringing the total number of transactions to 2,948 tenancies. In the quarter, fewer tenancies were signed across all property types. Leasing demand for factory spaces slowed further in Q4, but at a more muted pace, with leasing transactions for single- and multiple-user factory segments falling by 15.5% and 1.2% YoY respectively. For the warehouse sector, leasing volume recorded the second consecutive quarter of yearly decline with a much larger 9.4%. As such, the total leasing volume for the whole of 2022 fell 4.4% YoY, the fi rst decline recorded since 2011 when leasing transactions declined 20.0%. The decrease was largely arose from the single- and multiple-user factory spaces. In a similar light, the vacancy level for single-user factory grew for the sixth consecutive quarter by a larger 0.7 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.9% in Q4. This was likely to be due to the addition of 2.73 million sq ft of new supply, as well as some relocation among industrialists. 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). Signifi cant increases in vacancy rates were observed in the East (1.3 ppts) and North (2.6 ppts) Planning Regions. For the multiple-user factory segment, while its islandwide vacancy rates continued to increase, the rise was a marginal 0.1 of a ppt QoQ, to 10.9% in Q4. The large increase of 2.7 ppts in the North Planning Region was largely off set by the declines in vacancy levels in the East (-0.9 of a ppt) and North East (-1.8 ppts) Planning Regions. On the other hand, the warehouse vacancy level declined 0.9 of a ppt to 8.3% in the quarter, a reversal from the marginal 0.1 of a ppt increment in the previous quarter. This was partially due to a contraction in supply. Vacancy rates in all the Planning Regions were observed, except for the North Planning Region that recorded a 2.8 ppt increase. The overall industrial rents continued the upward trend for the ninth consecutive quarter in Q4, with JTC's rental index for multiple-user factory spaces increasing 2.6% QoQ, the largest quarterly increase since Q3/2013 when the rental index expanded 4.4%. The rental index for single-user factory spaces rose in the quarter as well, increasing 1.3% QoQ, a slightly moderated pace compared to the 2.0% in the previous quarter. The annual growth in 2022 of 4.1% and 8.3% in the JTC rental index of single- and multiple-user factory spaces respectively were the highest since 2012 when the rental index rose 12.9% and 9.6% respectively. For warehouse rents, the JTC's index continued to rise on a QoQ basis, surpassing the highest level attained in the previous quarter to 92.8 in Q4. This was a 2.2% increase QoQ, the highest quarterly increase since Q4/2013 when the rental index grew 3.4%. Savills' average monthly rents for prime multiple-user factories2 remained unchanged in Q4 at S$2.01 per sq ft, after increasing for the past seven consecutive quarters. On the other hand, the healthy leasing demand and a shortage of quality facilities led to Savills' average monthly rents for warehouse and logistics properties3 to continue rising, increasing 1.3% QoQ to S$1.53 per sq ft in the quarter. SALES MARKET Following the decline in Q3, strata industrial sales activity4 across all segments continued to fall in Q4. For the quarter in review, there were 432 transactions.

Similarly, the sales volume for multiple-user factory declined 18.7% QoQ from 503 in Q3 to 409 in Q4. Nevertheless, industrial sales prices still trended up in Q4, picking up the pace of increase from the previous quarter. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for 60-year leasehold and freehold industrial properties rose by 2.4% and 2.3% QoQ to S$474 per sq ft and S$776 per sq ft respectively in Q4. Apart from the longer remaining tenure and nature of freehold leases, the rise in prices was driven by the strong price growth for food factory properties. Similarly, Savills' basket of industrial properties pointed to 30-year leasehold property prices increasing at a faster pace of 2.0% QoQ to reach S$314 per sq ft in Q4. This may be due to stronger interest among some businesses/investors favouring properties of lower price quantum when they wished to mitigate the risks from rising economic uncertainties and elevated price volatility. Given that values are inversely proportionate to lease tenures, the 30-year industrial leaseholds benefi tted from this. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL In the last quarter of 2022, business park recorded the largest increase in vacancy rate across the industrial property segments. The vacancy level for this segment of the industrial market rose 2.7 ppts to 17.5%. This was largely contributed by a 9.3 ppts in vacancy levels in business parks in the West Region. In particular, vacancy rates in International Business Park (IBP) surged 12.8 ppts from 24.5% in Q3 to 37.3% in Q4. Apart from the weaker connectivity to main transport nodes, the higher vacancy levels were also attributed to the partial completion of Perennial Business City in the quarter. Apart from the performance at IBP, the vacancy levels at one-north and Changi Business Park (CBP) grew 0.8 of a ppt and 0.5 of a ppt respectively in the quarter. For CBP, the increase in vacancy rate came after a 1.3 ppts decline in vacancy level in Q3. Business parks that are not as well-connected to major transport nodes and do not have quality features may be less favoured by tenants. Hence, landlords will need to reduce their rents to try to shore up the occupancy. This was evident when we look at the monthly rent from Savills' standard business park properties5. They fell 1.1% QoQ after two consecutive quarters of increase to S$4.00 per sq ft in Q4. However, Savills' prime business park6 monthly rents declined marginally by 0.3% QoQ after fi ve consecutive quarters of growth to S$5.91 per sq ft in the quarter. High-spec industrial rents continued rising due to increasing occupier demand as businesses who qualify to located into industrial buildings look for such buildings with an offi ce look and feel. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. the push for a holistic food-related infrastructure. With strong support from the government, it should on paper lead to an increase in demand for higher quality food facilities, both by local and international players. On growth in the Logistics and Supply Chain industries, this ties in with the point on Building Resilience to Supply Chain Disruption. Over the past three years, global supply chains have been put through a series of severe tests. Companies are having to deal with huge demand volatility triggering short and varied cycles of decision making. Also, with manufacturing activity breaking out into regional clusters (instead of being concentrated in certain countries), supply chains will be redrawn. With the lessons learnt from the pandemic and future lessons likely to be learned from the on-going re-routing of global supply chains, diff erent companies are responding in varied ways - from securing supply at any cost to building inventory stockpiles and re-aligning supply markets to avoid future disruptions. Although economic conditions are becoming ever more challenging by the month, the outlook for industrial and logistics facilities here should be driven by a tug of war between companies which can adapt to the new clime of advanced manufacturing, food and novel food customer services and modern supply chain management versus those which struggle under the changing circumstances. On top of this, one has to be mindful of the pandemic induced supply backlog coming on line in 2023 and this should provide additional choices for end-users. On balance, we believe that given the strong demand for logistics and food factory space plus an environment where heightened infl ation will continue to infl uence monetary measures, rents in 2023 are expected to rise. Please refer to Table 1. PERIOD YoY % CHANGE IN MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY RENTS YoY % CHANGE IN WAREHOUSE & LOGISTICS RENTS 2023F 3% to 5% 3% to 6% TABLE 1: Rental Forecast for Multiple-user Factory and Warehouse & Logistics Segments Source Savills Research & Consultancy According to Savills' high-spec industrial basket7, the average monthly rent for high-spec industrial properties rose at a slightly muted 0.5% QoQ in Q4, as compared to the 1.1% in the past two quarters, to S$3.71 per sq ft. OUTLOOK The key themes surrounding the industrial and logistics (warehousing) sector for 2023 are expected to be: 1. Infl ation 2. Building Resilience to Supply Chain Disruption 3. Cost Control For points 1 and 2, it is ultimately likely to lead to greater stocking up as end users attempt to hedge against both rising cost and potential breaks in the supply of goods. Obviously, this is a positive on industrial and warehousing space demand. On the matter of cost control however, it could be a negative on demand. As economic challenges grow and the tech sector restructures to move into a new phase of growth, companies may feel the need to scale back on overheads like labour and rents. On the demand side, the industries which are expected to do well this year are: 1. Advanced Manufacturing 2. Food and Novel Food Consumer Services 3. Logistics and Supply Chain Although the manufacturing and warehousing sectors are expected to face a tug of war between infl ation-supply resilience versus cost control, there are bright spots including industries such as those listed above. Activities involving information communication technology (ICT), automation, computation, 3D printing (additive manufacturing), sensing, and networking, are expected to expand in volume. Industries in electronics, semiconductors, robotics, pharmaceuticals, medical products, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and aerospace engineering are expected to be the drivers contributing to the economy, driving demand for high spec industrial spaces.

The strong growth for multiple-user factory rents could be attributed to the growing demand for high-specification multi-user factories, as occupiers look for office grade industrial spaces near the city fringe. Demand for factories have also been supported by continued growth in the biomedical, and high value manufacturing industries as more firms are encouraged to set up their manufacturing hubs in Singapore due to its political neutrality, efficient infrastructure, and government support. 2 All Industrial Property The drop in overall occupancy of 0.3% this quarter was driven mainly by a fall in occupancy of single-user factories. There were also slight declines in the occupancy rates of the multi-user factory and warehouse segments, but this can be attributed to more supply coming onstream and catching up with demand after construction delays during Covid. Warehouse Although warehouse rents increased by 1.9% q- o-q overall, the rate of rental growth has moderated due to supply catching up with demand. Rental performance would vary across different warehouses, depending on their location and specifications. Specifically, there has been strong demand for investor grade ramp-up warehouses, as the delivery of new supply is not keeping pace with demand. However, leasing demand for warehouse space may taper in the coming quarters with a weaker manufacturing outlook, and as consumer demand shifts to services from goods post-Covid, leading to lower requirements for manufacturers to stockpile. Business Parks Business park rents have started to exhibit some sustained growth, on the back of tight supply in the city fringe areas. Most tenants prefer the newer, higher specification developments in the city fringe. On the other hand, leasing activity for space in the rest of island business parks has been slow. In addition, high vacancy rates and a higher supply pipeline could continue to suppress rents.

The warehouse segment might be an exception to this trend, as there appears to be a dearth of supply post 2024, and the pre- commitment to existing pipeline supply is high. Going forward, rental increases across all sectors are set to continue with an increase in service charges, as asset owners have to pass on higher operating costs to tenants. This increase in service charges could range from around 5% in warehouse and factories to 10% in business parks. On a macro level, economic indicators are collectively pointing to a manufacturing slowdown and weaker sentiment. This was largely driven by a slowdown in electronics shipments, with rising inflation and recession concerns weighing on consumer demand. Nevertheless, demand for industrial space, especially high specification warehouses and city fringe business parks, will still be underpinned by growth industries such as the food, logistics, precision engineering and biomedical sectors, which in turn will support rental and price growth, albeit at a more measured pace. 6.9 16.8 14.3 4.2 4.5 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0 18.0 Q4 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F 2026F Estimated GFA (mil sf) Warehouse Business Park Single-user Factory Multi-user Factory About Colliers Colliers (NASDAQ, TSX: CIGI) is a leading diversified professional services and investment management company.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Growth Forecast Narrowed Singapore's economy grew by 4.4% y-o-y during Q2 2022, taking the first-half growth to 4.1%. The overall manufacturing sector has recorded 26 consecutive months of expansion as of August with its purchasing managers' index (PMI) being at 50 and above. However, PMI dipped 0.1 point from July to 50.0 in August, indicating relatively weaker manufacturing sentiments. On the back of weakened global economic environment weighed down by more aggressive tightening monetary policy to tackle inflationary pressure and taking into consideration Singapore's economic performance during H1 2022, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has narrowed its economic growth forecast range this year to 3%-4%, from an earlier projection of 3%-5%. Continued Rental Growth Across Most Segments Rental increases were observed for all industrial asset classes during Q3 2022 as vacancy rates remained relatively tight. Notably, vacancy rates vary across different segments. Vacancy rate of prime logistics went down to below 3.0% and city-fringe business park vacancy rate was tightened further to 3.1% while vacancy rate of outlying business parks stayed elevated at almost 25.0%. Nonetheless, rents of business parks in outlying areas inched up marginally during the quarter, increasing by 0.1% q-o-q, as some landlords have raised their asking rents to keep pace with rising inflation, especially for buildings that has recently undergone Asset Enhancement Initiative. City-fringe business park and Science Park rents also increased in tandem with broader market trend, growing by 0.2% and 1.1% q-o-q, respectively. Warehouses and prime logistics rents continued to rise in Q3 2022 given further tightening of vacancy rates. The rates of rental growth in warehouse and prime logistics segments have moderated as more new supply comes onstream amid a temporary slowdown in demand and expansion due to rising macro-economic challenges. Nonetheless, stockpiling demand for food and raw materials would continue to support occupancy levels for prime logistics / warehouse spaces. Despite substantial completed supply, factory space continued to witness rental growth of 0.7% q-o-q in Q3 2022 on the back of healthy manufacturing performance, especially for the precision engineering (+4.9% y-o-y in Q2 2022) and the general manufacturing (+11.0% y-o-y in Q2 2022) clusters. Similarly, high-tech rents also inched up by 0.7% q-o-q as leasing demand was underpinned by high-value manufacturing and tech sectors as well as spillover demand from CBD office market where rents continued to experience robust growth. Healthy Investment Interests Despite Headwinds The industrial investment market saw some activities as investors look for assets with a comfortable yield spread amid a rising interest rate environment. Industrial assets typically offer higher yields as compared to other asset classes due to their shorter leases and lower investors' familiarity coupled with JTC's regulations. Notably, Ascendas REIT was reported to acquire Philips Asean Pacific (APAC) Centre for S$104.8 million and 1 Buroh Lane for S$191.9 million at estimated yields of 7.2% and 7.0%, respectively during Q3 2022.

The rate of manufacturing growth of 5.7% y-o-y in Q2 was a contraction from the y-o-y increases of above 7% each quarter throughout 2021. Despite sentiment turning tentative, manufacturing clusters such as transport engineering, general manufacturing, electronics and precision engineering continued to be the main contributors to growth and output increases in Q2. In addition, the construction industry has ramped up activity after COVID-19 delays, growing by 3.3% y-o-y in Q2 from the 2.4% increase in the previous quarter. This in turn led to knock-on stimulus for manufacturers supporting the construction sector. After driving much of the economic growth through the pandemic years, prevailing global geopolitical and economic challenges have tempered business sentiments in the industrial sector. The Business Expectations report published by Singstat reported that a net weighted balance of 8% of manufacturing firms anticipate a less favourable business outlook from July to December 2022 compared to the 2% that expected a favourable business situation for the period April to September 2022. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in July and August 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against April and May 2022) and y-o-y (against July and August 2021). Knight Frank Research Reports are available at knightfrank.com.sg/research Additionally, in the month of September, the overall Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) posted a contraction of 49.9, after 26 consecutive months of expansion with a corresponding contraction of 49.4 in the Electronics Sector. Singapore's appeal as a strategic and trusted node for business Nevertheless, despite the moderation in overall industrial performance, Singapore remains a compelling destination for regional headquarters as well as a location for high-value manufacturing activities. Many foreign companies diverted their attention towards the city-state as a location of security amid global uncertainty, leveraging on the competitive edge that the financial hub offers as well as the transparency and stability of its legal and regulatory framework. In Q2 2022, fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments in Singapore totalled S$6.3 billion, the highest on a quarterly basis since Q1 2020 when S$10.3 billion was secured. Manufacturing accounted for S$3.6 billion, which included S$2.9 billion of investments in the electronics sector. Examples of notable foreign businesses setting up base in Singapore recently include SOCOMEC, a leading global specialist in power management solutions, which will be opening its new Asia Pacific headquarters at the Meiban Industrial Building along Ubi Road.

Easing demand for factory space Industrial sales totalled S$773.1 million in the third quarter, easing by 12.2% q-o-q and 5.0% y-o-y. Despite this, overall prices continued to trend upwards with an average price of S$444 psf, an increase of 2.4% compared to the previous quarter, together with increased FAI (Exhibit 1). Based on transactions, the Geylang and Woodlands Planning Areas were sought-after locations with 49 (S$72.5 million) and 47 (S$42.5 million) factory units transacted in the quarter, the majority being multiple-user factories. While the overall demand for industrial space declined, the improving construction and transport sectors driving output expansions in certain manufacturing clusters propped up sales activity in Q3. As such, the median rent for multiple-user factories was healthy at S$1.89 psf pm in July and August 2022 with 1,659 tenancies, compared to a median of S$1.76 psf pm in the same period a year ago (Exhibit 2). More businesses integrating and producing sustainable alternatives or products such as plant-based protein and bags could sustain leasing demand for multiple-user factory space that support these emerging business types. Market outlook The steady stream of investment commitments flowing into Singapore will continue to generate value and create more jobs as Singapore readjusts towards pre-pandemic normalcy. Coupled with the nation's standing as a safe business destination, these could potentially serve as a shelter against unforeseen external shocks and the looming economic uncertainty. Industrial prices and rentals will remain stable, supported by the steady demand for space, and is enroute to grow 3% to 5% for the whole of 2022.

It was led by a pickup in activity across services industries and this made up for the slowdown in the manufacturing sector. The overall factory activity in Singapore contracted for the fi rst time in two years in September. In the face of weakened manufacturing sentiment arising from a slowdown in the global economies and also persistent price pressures, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) ended its 26 straight months of expansion and slipped to 49.9 in September. Growth in Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) also decelerated in September, posting the slowest rate of 3.1% YoY since August last year. RENTAL MARKET Leasing volume1 continued to fall in Q3, albeit at a moderated pace at 6.3% YoY, bringing the total number of transactions to 3,209 tenancies. The decline was attributed to fewer tenancies signed across all property types. Leasing demand for factory spaces continued to weaken in Q3 with leasing transactions for single- and multiple-user factory segments falling by 21.2% and 5.7% YoY respectively. While leasing demand for warehouse logistics space remained strong in prime areas, those for warehouses saw a marginal decline of 0.6% YoY. The vacancy level for single-user factory rose by 0.5 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.2% in Q3. This is likely to be due to an injection of new supply (580,000 sq ft) and some relocation among industrialists, particularly the West and North Planning Areas. Despite some major completions including JTC Defu Industrial City, the vacancy level for multiple-user factory inched up by just 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 10.8% as demand for logistics space was still strong. Compared to the 9.1% vacancy level recorded in Q2, that measure stayed relatively stable at 9.2% as the take-up in Central and North Planning Regions were healthy. The overall industrial rents continued to increase for eight consecutive quarters in Q3, with JTC's rental index for factory spaces rising at its fastest pace since 2016. For warehouse rents, the JTC's index rose again to its highest level in the last six years. Savills' average monthly rents also continued to increase in Q3, with rents for prime multiple-user factories2 rising by 0.4% QoQ to S$2.01 per sq ft. With the support from 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. healthy leasing momentum and a shortage of quality facilities, Savills' average monthly rents for warehouse and logistics properties3 doubled the pace of increase to 2.8% QoQ and rose to S$1.51 per sq ft in Q3. SALES MARKET Following a short-lived uptick in Q2, strata industrial sales activity4 fell 15.7% QoQ across all segments to 452 transactions. This could be partly attributed to the growing recession fears and rising cost of borrowing which weighed on investors' sentiments. Strata warehouse sales fell marginally to 24 deals in Q3, compared with 34 in Q2. The sales volume for multiple-user factory declined from 497 in Q2 to 424 deals in Q3. However, the sales momentum for West Connect Building continued to hold up while other projects saw a muted sales take-up in Q3. Industrial sales prices continued trending up in Q3, even though the overall price increase of properties with longer tenures halved from the previous quarter. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for 60-year leasehold and freehold industrial properties rose by 1.2% QoQ to S$463 per sq ft and S$758 per sq ft respectively in Q3. Apart from the longer remaining tenure and nature of freehold leases, the rise in prices was driven by the strong price growth for food factory properties. On the other hand, Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that 30-year leasehold property prices increased at a quicker pace of 0.9% QoQ to S$308 per sq ft in Q3. It could be led by stronger interest among some businesses which prefer properties of a lower quantum, and therefore these are of shorter lease tenures, to mitigate their risks amid rising economic uncertainty and elevated market volatility. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL In Q3, business park is the only segment which saw a slight improvement in occupancy level. It is likely led by an increase in appetite for taking up business park space amid the tightening of offi ce supply. Although one- north and International Business Park (IBP) recorded higher vacancy level in Q3, the islandwide vacancy level for business park space eased by 0.1 of a ppt QoQ to 14.8% due to higher take-up in the Changi Business Park (CBP) and CleanTech Park locations. Nonetheless, vacancy level in areas such as Science Park, IBP and CBP remained under pressure due to locational factors that lead to weaker connectivity to main transport nodes. Moreover, business consulting fi rms, 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 2 November 2022.

Coupled with the rise in service charges, rents are expected to continue on an upward trend as landlords pass on higher business costs to tenants. Notably, there is a dearth of supply of warehouse space after 2024 when no signifi cant new supply is expected to come on stream. This could put further upward pressure on warehouse rents. Prior to that, rents for prime warehouse and logistics properties are expected to rise by 5.0% YoY for each year in 2022 and 2023. Although rental growth for prime multiple-user factory spaces is forecast to moderate to 5% YoY in 2023, it is likely to see high growth for new food factories which are expected to complete next year.

This is despite the sector's moderate performance in recent quarters and a rocky global economy, said real estate consultancy Knight Frank in a report on Friday (Oct 7). Industrial sales, for instance, totalled at S$773.1 million in Q3 of 2022, down 12.2 per cent from the previous quarter, and 5 per cent from 2021. The number of industrial tenancies plunged to 2,237, down 28 per cent from the previous quarter and 36.1 per cent from last year. Knight Frank also noted an overall slowdown in the rate of manufacturing growth so far this year. It said: \"After driving much of the economic growth throughout the pandemic years, prevailing global geopolitical and economic challenges tempered business sentiment in the industrial sector.\" Despite observing that sentiment has turned \"tentative\", the team at Knight Frank predicts that industrial prices and rentals will stabilise and are on track to growing 3 to 5 per cent for the whole of 2022. It noted that overall prices of industrial properties continued to trend upward this quarter, with an average price of S$444 per square feet (psf), up 2.4 per cent from the previous quarter. Popular locations for these transactions - the majority of which were for multiple-user factories - include the Geylang Planning Area, with 49 transactions worth S$72.5 million, and Woodlands Planning Area, with 47 transactions worth S$42.5 million.

For example, several international semiconductor companies - such as American semiconductor firm GlobalFoundries, German microchip maker Infineon and French water manufacturer Soitec - have announced substantial investments to expand their operations in Singapore, under plans to ramp up production capacity amid the global chip shortage. The most recent company to set up in the Republic was Pall Corporation, a filtration, separation and purification technology business that in August broke ground for a US$100 million manufacturing facility. \"The steady stream of investment commitments flowing into Singapore will continue to generate value and create more jobs,\" said the consultancy. \"Coupled with the nation's standing as a safe business destination, these could potentially serve as a shelter against unforeseen external shocks and the looming economic uncertainty.\" READ MORE Multi-faceted industrial market in Apac has diverse growth opportunities Industrial S-Reits report positive rental reversions Singapore industrial space rents, prices continue to rise in Q1; occupancy falls: JTC INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY KNIGHT FRANK SINGAPORE PROPERTY Already a subscriber?

Backed by strong government support and incentives, more firms are expected to set up their manufacturing hubs in Singapore, with sustained growth in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors to underpin demand for factory space. 2 All Industrial Property Both the JTC all Industrial price and rental indices continued their seventh consecutive quarter of growth in Q2 2022; the rental index rose by 1.5% QOQ, accelerating from its 1.0% growth in the previous quarter as demand caught up with supply. On the other hand, the price index rose by 1.5% QOQ this quarter, easing from the 3.1% QOQ growth last quarter. Warehouse On the back of strong leasing activity, occupancy for private warehouses further tightened to 91.4% from 90.9% in the previous quarter. Although warehouse rents increased by 2.1% QOQ overall, rental performance would vary across different warehouses, depending on their location and specifications. Specifically for prime logistics (investor grade ramp-up warehouses), where vacancy rates remain tight and pre- commitment rates to upcoming supply are high, rental growth has outperformed, and there will continue to be healthy rental growth on the back of strong demand. Business Parks With the increase in business park stock, occupancy has dropped by 50 pp this quarter. Business parks rents have started to exhibit some growth (0.2% QOQ), on the back of higher demand from knowledge and high-value sectors such as technology and biomedical firms. Rental growth is likely to be skewed towards newer, higher specification developments in the city fringe as these are preferred by tenants.

However, with an average annual supply of about 12.9 mil sf till 2025 coming onstream (compared to 7.5 mil sf over the past three years), and with 16.8 mil sf to be completed this year, the higher supply is likely to temper the pace of rental and price growth. On one hand, macroeconomic uncertainties are prompting industrialists to fortify their supply chains by diversifying locations and stockpiling; on the other, it has also led them to be more cautious about their expansion plans. Other risks which could dampen business sentiments in the industrial sector include rising commodity prices, disruptions to global supply chains, slowing growth and higher cost of capital due to rising interest rates in developed economies, as well as the resurgence of renewed pandemic outbreaks which may reintroduce restrictions and further disrupt supply chains and labour supply. In the long term, demand for industrial space will still be driven by tailwinds such as Singapore's increasing focus on higher-value manufacturing and biomedical sectors. Therefore, Colliers expects rents to grow by between 2 and 4% this year. Industrial prices could grow at a higher clip of between 5 and 7% on the back of growing interest in industrial assets due to their higher yields and limited availability.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Steady Growth Expected for 2022 Despite Headwinds Official data released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in May 2022 showed that Singapore's economy expanded by 3.7% y-o-y during the first quarter of 2022, which was faster than the advance estimate of 3.4%. Manufacturing sector which grew by 7.1% y-o-y in Q2 2022, extending the 13.2% full-year growth in 2021 was the top contributor to GDP growth during the quarter. GDP growth for 2022 is expected to slow to about 3% to 5% given global economic uncertainties due to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. Broad-based Rent Growth Continues But Caution Setting in Industrial market continued to improve across most segments. While rents of business parks in both the city fringe and outlying areas as well as factory remained stable on the back of tight vacancy rates, the other segments witnessed rising rents with prime logistics continuing to outperform. A flight to quality continues to drive the market and high-tech factories continue to see demand with rents inching up slightly in Q2 2022 as occupiers seek newer office-like industrial spaces in close-to-city locations for better corporate image and talent retention. Prime logistics and warehouse rents rose 2.0% and 1.5% q-o-q respectively in Q2 2022, as tight supply continues to support rental growth. A swift re-opening of the economy is diverting consumption from goods to services, as people spend more on travel and leisure activities. With pandemic- fueled demand for goods tapering off coupled with current macro-uncertainties, e-commerce players are adopting a watch-and-wait stance. Consequently, warehouse / prime logistics rental growth may slow in the upcoming quarters amid more cautious market sentiments. However, stockpiling demand for goods and food, continues to persist, to hedge against high freight costs and supply chain disruptions. This would underpin occupancy levels for prime logistics / warehouse space, especially for developments with cold chain facilities. Steady Long-term Fundamentals to Underpin Industrial Capital Values The industrial market is still expected to lock in positive rental growth for 2022 despite looming global recession risks as Singapore economy continues to grow, driving demand for industrial space, and new supply remains tight in some segments. A flight to quality will gravitate demand for newer and better spec facilities, leading to increased incentives for redevelopment and asset enhancement, though this will be balanced against higher development costs due to higher financing and construction costs. The industrial market's fundamentals are underpinned by long-term demand from high-value manufacturing and e-commerce growth. Singapore aims to grow her manufacturing sector by 50% by 2030 and Singapore's e-commerce market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% to reach S$14.2 billion in 2025 according to forecasts by GlobalData. Also, there is limited available institutional-grade industrial stock for sale. As such, we don't anticipate much repricing in the market especially for longer tenure industrial land, even as interest rates go up as owners are likely to stick to their asking prices.

Rate it from -1 to 1 on the sentiments for Singapore's industrial market. Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Overall Outlook Key observations New supply continues to surge but demand keeping pace. In 2Q22, 322,000 sqm of new supply of industrial space was added to the market. Total new supply added to the market in 1H22 was 655,000 sqm, almost on par with the 669,000 sqm added to the market for the whole of FY21. With borders now reopened and construction activity ramping up, project completions are also expected to pick up, and a further c.1.6m sqm of new industrial space is expected to come online in 2H22. Around 43% of new supply will be single-user factory space, c.30% will be multiple-user factory space, while the remaining c.27% will come from warehouses and business parks. Despite the faster pace of project completions, demand in 2Q22 continued to be robust. Although the multiple-user and warehouse segments saw the largest increase in new supply of 129,000 sqm and 109,000 sqm respectively, demand was more than sufficient to offset new stock. Both segments reported positive net absorption in 2Q22, which helped to offset the slight negative net absorption in the single-user and business parks segments. Overall occupancy rate for industrial properties inched up 0.2 ppt in 2Q22 to 90.0%. Rental index at a five-year high. On the back of higher occupancies and continued strong demand, the rental index for industrial properties has inched up to 93.7 in 2Q22. This is the highest level reported in more than five years, with the rental index at 93.8 at the end of FY16. The increase in rental index was contributed by all four segments of industrial properties which also reported an increase q-o-q. Unsurprisingly, the most significant increase in rental index in 2Q22 came from the multiple-user and warehouse segments as a result of stock take ups. Within the multiple-user factory space, the highest increases in rental index were seen in the North Region and West Region where the q-o-q index increased 3.6 ppts and 2.3 ppts, respectively. What are we watching? Delivery of new supply in FY22. As the labour crunch eases and project completion continues to ramp up, we are expecting the delivery of more stock this year. The 655,000 sqm of new supply completed in 1H22 was already almost on par with the total new supply in FY21. We understand that many of these were projects that were delayed, and we are expecting more of such projects to be completed by the end of FY22. Based on estimates from JTC, a further 1.5m sqm of new supply is projected to be delivered in 2H22, with the bulk coming from the single-user and multiple-user factory space. We are keeping a close watch on the new supply for multiple-user factories where c.470,000 sqm of stock will be added in 2H22, potentially putting pressure on occupancies and rents. Slower rate of new completions expected beyond FY22. Looking further ahead, new supply of industrial space that is projected to be completed is expected to slow down. Between FY23 and FY25, slightly less than 900,000 sqm of new stock is expected to be added to the market on an annual basis. Approximately 53% of the new stock in the next three years is single-user factory space, c.19% are multiple-user factory space, c.16% are business parks, and c.13% are warehouses. Assuming that demand continues to remain healthy, we believe that the spike in new supply in FY22 may put some pressure on rents and occupancies, but the excess supply should be gradually absorbed from FY23 onwards.

Rental Index: Rentals for industrial properties are at a 5-year high Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * The overall industrial properties rental index has been on the uptrend since late- FY20, likely due to a lack of new supply as construction delays hit. * Industrial properties rental index is currently 93.7, a level not seen since the end of FY16. The rising rental index has mostly been driven by the multiple-user factory and warehouse segments. * The multiple-user and warehouse rental indices are currently 92.2 and 89.1 respectively. The last time both rental indices were this high was in late-FY16 to early-FY17. * Single-user rental index is currently 97.8 and has been fluctuating at these levels over the past three to four years. * Business parks rental index peaked at 113.3 at the beginning of FY20 and currently hovers around 112.1, a slight improvement from the previous quarter. 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 Industrial Property Multi-User Single-User Warehouse Business Parks Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 4 . Key Charts - Industrial Sector Spike in new supply in 2022F due to rollover from the past two years Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * A total of c.2.2m sqm of new industrial space is expected to be added to the market in FY22, the largest supply to be added in a single year. This is a result of a rollover in project completions from the last two years as the COVID-19 pandemic led to construction delays and disruptions to supply chains. * Only 669,000sqm of new supply was completed in the whole of FY21. The remaining 784,000sqm of new stock that was previously expected to be completed in FY21 has now been pushed to FY22. * Of the remaining c.1.6m sqm of new supply expected to hit the market over the next two quarters of FY22, c.43% will be single-user factory space that has likely been developed by industrialists for their own use. * Multiple-user factory space makes up another c.30% of the upcoming supply, and warehouses and business park spaces will contribute the remaining c.27% of the new stock. * Take-up of multiple-user and warehouse spaces has been healthy so far in the first two quarters of FY22 with positive net absorption despite the delivery of new stock. However, the spike in supply for the rest of FY22 may put some pressure on occupancy and rental rates going forward. - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F 000' sqm Supply Demand Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 5 . Spike in new supply in 2022 is expected to lead to negative net absorption Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * Net absorption in FY20 and FY21 were positive due to the delays in construction and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. * Although the amount of new industrial supply in FY21 was more than twice the amount seen in FY20, pent-up demand and expansion needs led to a slightly positive net absorption in FY21. * The positive net absorption in FY21 came from the multi-user factory and warehouse segments, partially offset by the negative net absorption from the single-user factory and business park segments. * With c.2.2m sqm of new industrial supply expected to hit the market in FY22, we might see some negative net absorption. We believe that the negative net absorption will likely be contributed by the single-user and multiple-user factory segments, which are projected to deliver the bulk of the new supply this year. * In the medium term, net absorption could surprise on the upside as some construction delays persist. It may likely lead to some of the new supply in FY22 being rolled over to the following years and help spread out new stock more evenly and lessen pressure on vacancy rates. 8.1% 9.1% 9.4% 10.5% 11.1% 10.7% 10.8% 10.1% 9.8% 10.1% 10.3% 10.7% 10.8% 0.0% 2.0% 4.0% 6.0% 8.0% 10.0% 12.0% (8) (6) (4) (2) - 2 4 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F m'sqft Net Suplus/(Net deficit) Vacancy Rate (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 6 . Rental reversion trend expected to remain healthy in the coming years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * After several years of negative rental reversions (3-year cycle) for the factory and warehouse segments, the trend reversed in FY21. Positive rental reversions for business parks have been tapering off in the past two years, and was flat in FY21. * Overall rentals in the near term are expected to remain relatively healthy as construction delays continue to limit the addition of new stock to the market. * Over the last two years, the logistics sector has been driven by the advancement of e-commerce and stockpiling activities. This has led to the outperformance in rentals for the warehouse segment, and we believe its outperformance will continue through to FY23. -20% -10% 0% 10% 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F % reversions (3 year cycle) Business Park Warehouse Factory Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 7 . Industrial Sub-sector - Multi-User Factory Multi-user factory supply: Supply spike in 2022F due to construction delays in previous two years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * The drop in new completions in FY21 led to a 170bps improvement in occupancy rates, and vacancy rates fell to a low of 9.8%, a level not seen in the past nine years. * Due to further construction delays in FY21, some new supply has been rolled over to FY22. This was likely the main reason for the robust increase in occupancy rates for the multiple-user factory space, to 90.2%. * As more delays caused some new supply to be rolled over to FY22, the spike in supply for multiple-user factory space could likely lead to vacancy rates inching back up to c.11% in FY23 and FY24. * Occupancy rates could surprise on the upside in FY22 if the labour crunch situation persists and new supply is spread out more evenly over the next few years. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F m Sqft Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 8 .

However, 2Q22 reported a surprise rebound in occupancy rates as demand was stronger than expected. * Again, occupancy and rents could surprise on the upside if construction delays continue to persist, and new supply continues to be rolled over to the next year. 85% 86% 87% 88% 89% 90% 91% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022f 2023f 2024f 2025f 1Q18 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 S$ psf pm Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 9 . Warehouses: Logistics sector driving demand for warehouses Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * Although there was an increase of c.300,000sqm in new warehouse supply in FY21, vacancy rates improved by 10bps due to strong demand from the logistics industry. * Stockpiling and storage activities drove demand for warehouse space throughout FY21, with rental rates reporting some upside as more backfilling of excess supply from previous years continued. * Demand from third-party logistics businesses and those supporting the e-commerce sector are expected to continue driving demand for modern warehouse space in the medium term. * Even with more new supply expected to be added to the market in FY22, we believe occupancy rates will remain stable with the continued strong demand for modern warehouses. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% - 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F m Sqft Warehouse Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 10 .

Industrial Sub-sector - Business Parks Majority of business park space has been pre-committed Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * Even though there has been some addition to the supply of business parks in FY21, demand was also strong, as most of the new projects were pre-committed; and also due to the lack of new supply over the past two years. * As such, occupancy rates improved by 210bps to c.83.7% in FY21 as vacant space was gradually backfilled. * Looking ahead, the lack of new supply of business park space in FY22 could lead to it outperforming the other segments as technology, biomedical, and consumer goods tenants continue to drive demand. * Although some new supply is expected by FY23 and FY24, we believe that most has already been pre-committed, and we believe occupancy and rental rates could continue its uptrend. * As business parks in the city fringe precincts of Buona Vista and Alexandra are favoured over the rest of the island, we believe these areas will outperform business parks in the other areas such as Jurong, Changi, and Tuas. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% 18% (0.5) - 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F m Sqft Business Park Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 12 .

GDP increased by 3.7% y-o-y thus far in the first three months of 2022, supported by the 7.1% y-o-y growth of the manufacturing sector. This was primarily led by strong output expansions within the electronics and precision engineering clusters in Q1 as global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment remained robust. Nonetheless, business sentiments have moderated. According to Singstat's Business Expectations report for the manufacturing sector, overall, a net weighted balance of +2% of manufacturing firms foresee a favourable business outlook for the period April to September 2022, lower than the preceding net weighted balance of +8% recorded in the previous quarter. As such, despite dampened business sentiments due to prolonged global uncertainties, the electronics industry continues to grow, boosting performance in the overall manufacturing sector as the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) posted an expansion of 50.3 in June 2022. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in April and May 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against January and February 2022) and y-o-y (against April and May 2021). Overall, the pace of industrial sales has slowed down. In Q2 2022, total transactions amounted to S$661.5 million, representing declines of 4.9% and 30.2% on a q-o-q and y-o-y basis respectively. Multiple-user factory spaces, posing as one of the more affordable industrial assets, continued to register healthy levels of sales, bringing the average price to S$439 psf (Exhibit 1). One of the main contributors to the demand for industrial space is the food industry, where occupiers are actively on the lookout for food factories and central kitchens in Singapore. With rising global concerns on food security, as well as access to raw materials and necessities, stockpiling activity has increased. The strengthening Singapore dollar provided support for stockpiling, mitigating escalation in costs as inflation becomes significant. The need for space to support the increase in firms' inventories expanded demand for warehouse space, evident from the 212 rental transactions recorded for such space in just April 2022 alone (Exhibit 2). Historically, this leasing volume stands as the highest number of tenancies on a monthly basis since data became available, bringing the cumulative median rental for warehouse to S$1.85 psf pm in April and May.

In April 2022, the redevelopment of Pokka's regional headquarters commenced. To be completed by Q1 2024, the new state-of-the-art building will house an innovation and incubation hub with sustainable features and facilities. More recently in May 2022, Singapore's first eco-friendly manufacturing hub, Green Lab, spanning some 200,000 sf officially opened. Envisioned to be a one-stop production plant, the facility will manufacture some of Singapore's first fully compostable plant-based bags that could potentially replace existing plastic ones. Fraser and Neave (F&N), who owns a 60% stake in Green Lab through its publishing arm, Times Publishing, will be switching the packaging of its in-house brands and products to the sustainable alternatives produced. Despite existing global and regional uncertainties, bright spots continue to highlight the industrial market. The persisting chip shortage globally will continue to generate demand for electronics, and the transport engineer- ing cluster will benefit from the increased demand for air travel as travel accelerates in many parts of the world. Thus, prices and rentals for industrial space remain on track to grow 3% to 5% for the whole of 2022. In tandem with these initiatives, JTC has also introduced solar deployment models, helping industries to transition towards sustainable and renewable energy sources through the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. To facilitate solar energy adoption, solar deployment will be mandatory for certain sites that meet the requirements set by the government agency.

This was attributed to a strong growth (5.7% YoY) in the manufacturing sector and also from the easing of local and border restrictions since April. The overall factory activity in Singapore picked up steam in Q2, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inching up from 50.1 in March to 50.3 in June. Despite headwinds such as moderation in global growth, recession risks, COVID-19 disruptions and the ongoing geopolitical tensions, the higher electronics PMI reading indicated a strong performance for the electronics industry. Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) also performed well, posting a 9.0% YoY growth in June. RENTAL MARKET Leasing volume1 in Q2/2022 fell 10.4% YoY to 3,028 transactions, ending seven consecutive quarters of increase since Q3/2020. This was mainly due to fewer tenancies signed for single- and multiple-user factory segments which fell by 7.1% and 14.0% YoY respectively in Q2. The warehouse space was the only segment which recorded higher leasing numbers, rising by 7.0% YoY in Q2 (+1.8% YoY in Q1. Rising demand from ecommerce and third-party logistics (3PL) fi rms was the likely cause for this increase. Correspondingly, the vacancy level for warehouse space eased to 9.1%, the lowest since Q4/2015. Although there was a net supply of nearly 1.2 million sq ft of new warehouse spaces in Q2, it was off set by a net demand of 1.8 million sq ft. It is likely to be due to healthy demand for modern logistics spaces, which helped to lift the take-up rate of new developments such as Logos Penjuru Logistics Centre. While vacancy level for multiple-user factory space fell by 0.6 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.6% in Q2, that for single-user factory space remained fl at at 9.7%. Along with healthy demand for factory and warehouse spaces, especially those well located or modern facilities, rents continued to increase at a faster pace across all industrial segments in Q2/2022. The JTC's rental index for multiple-user factory and warehouse spaces have retraced their levels since 2016 and 2017 respectively. Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 and warehouse and logistics properties3 increased by 5.2% QoQ to S$2.00 per sq ft and 1.4% QoQ to S$1.47 per sq ft in Q2. 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 increased 28.0% QoQ to 512 transactions in Q2/2022, a level not seen since Q3/2014. Strata warehouse sales rose by 73.7% QoQ with 33 deals and multiple-user factory sales which rose by 25.3% QoQ to 475 deals. The sales activity in multiple-user factories was mainly led by resale transactions buildings such as West Connect Building and Mega@Woodlands. This was likely backed by local SMEs that acquired ramp-up facilities with modern specifi cations and reasonable remaining tenure for their own business operations. As there were signs showing price resistance for some industrial buildings with shorter tenure, Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for 30-year leasehold industrial properties remained fl at at S$305 per sq ft in Q2/2022. On the other hand, some 60-year leasehold and freehold industrial properties recorded larger price increases, supporting the overall price growth in Q2. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, 60-year leasehold prices increased by 2.4% QoQ to S$457 per sq ft while that of freehold properties rose by 2.8% QoQ to S$749 per sq ft in Q2/2022. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPECS INDUSTRIAL The islandwide vacancy level for business park space rose by 0.5 of a ppt QoQ to 14.9% in Q2/2022, a reversal of the 1.1 ppt QoQ decline in the previous quarter. While vacancy rate in the Central and East Planning Region remained relatively fl at from Q1, the completion of CleanTech Three led to an increase in vacancy rate in the West Planning Region to 29.9%, the highest since Q4/2004. Owing to the scarcity and steady demand in Mapletree Business City and one-north regions, Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents continued trending up in Q2, rising by 0.7% QoQ to S$5.93 per sq ft. Savills' standard business park properties6 monthly rents also increased by 0.7% QoQ to S$4.03 per sq ft as some of the landlords at Science Park started to raise their rental expectations. Some of the more accessible high- specs industrial developments in prime locations also saw an uptick in their rents in Q2/2022. Some fi rms do not mind a slight rental premium for the accessibility and convenience of the location. As such, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-specs industrial basket7 increased by 1.1% QoQ to S$3.61 per sq ft in Q2/2022. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 15 July 2022. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft.

Besides rising imported infl ation which translated to greater domestic cost pressures, there is also the spectre of China's growth slowdown and political tensions in the North Asia. Furthermore, the fi ght against infl ation has woken up the US Federal Reserve Bank to hike interest rates into a slowing economy. The complementary actions by central banks in advanced economies to tame infl ation is synchronising the global economic cycle on the downside. Singapore's economy, however, is still expected to expand this year because of the low base we came out of in 2021. Although the economy is expected to continue growing, the pace of growth will be slower compared with last year as trade-related sectors may moderate amid persistent supply constraints and the expected recession facing developed economies. It is perhaps in 2023 that we may see greater lacklustre economic performance once we have set a high totem mark this year. Despite strengthening headwinds, the industrial and logistics market remained as one of the most resilient sub-asset classes across the spectrum of real estate market. As fl ight- landlords to pass through higher service charges to the occupiers. Also, one cannot rule out the possibility that domestic pump priming works may be on the off ering if the external economy slows, and SMEs may expand their industrial space to handle higher domestic related demand. As rents for prime multiple-user factory space had already risen 9.0% Year-to-Date, we are revising out full-year increase from 0% to 2% to 10% to 12%. Even if the economy were to slow, the prospect of domestic pump priming activities may embolden SMEs to take on greater space. For warehouse & logistics properties, we maintain our forecast of a 2% to 5% rise this year.

Backed by strong government support, Colliers expects more firms to set up their manufacturing hubs in Singapore, with sustained growth in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors to underpin demand for factory space in 2022. However, geopolitical tensions have resulted in rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions, causing inflationary pressures and clouding the outlook of the manufacturing sector. As such, manufacturers might also become more cautious in their expansion plans. 2 All Industrial The JTC All Industrial price and rental indices continued their sixth consecutive quarter of growth in Q1 2022, reaching their highest levels since the beginning of 2017. Trade indicators have exhibited a similar trend, with expansion recorded in manufacturing output, NODX and PMI, albeit with growth moderating. Warehouse Warehouses registered the highest rental increase of 1.5% QOQ among all the segments. Colliers has observed that demand for prime logistics space and high specification warehouses has been extremely high; third party logistics players and end users have been actively looking for additional storage space to meet stronger consumption post-Covid, especially amidst supply chain disruptions and a global shortage of semi-conductor chips. As such, older warehouses may be taken off the market to be upgraded or redeveloped to meet the demand for these assets. Business Parks Business parks rents have remained flat, improving from last quarter's 0.5% decline. Strong net absorption has led to occupancy increasing by 110 pp this quarter, led by take-up at city fringe business parks. With the limited supply of quality offices and higher office rents, more demand from the tech and services industries could continue to spillover to city fringe business parks.

In addition to 25.90 mil sf more industrial space scheduled to complete this year, the average annual pipeline supply from present to 2025 at 12.92 mil sf, is almost double the 6.46 mil sf over the past three years. This anticipated surge in supply could slow price and rental growth, while providing more options for industrialists at the same time. With most Singapore residents vaccinated, there will likely be less storage space required for medical products. Older warehouses are also seeing resistance to rental increases from small and medium enterprises. All these factors might cause warehouse rental growth to taper in the coming quarters. Nevertheless, demand for industrial assets, especially high specification warehouses and business parks, should still be underpinned by growth industries such as the food, media, logistics, technology and biomedical sectors. Further, the drive for more robust supply chains, the switch to a just-in-case strategy, as well as the increasing digitalisation of industries and the economy should continue to support industrial rent and price growth, albeit at a more measured pace.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Singapore Maintains Stable Growth Forecast for 2022 According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Singapore's economy expanded by 7.6% y-o-y in 2021, faster than an advance estimate of 7.2%. GDP growth in 2021 was driven mainly by the manufacturing, information & communications, finance & insurance as well as wholesale trade sectors. Full-year 2021 manufacturing growth reached 13.2%, extending the 7.5% expansion in the preceding year. Singapore maintained its growth forecast for this year at 3% to 5%. However, downside risks have increased as the ongoing global supply bottlenecks alongside rising energy prices due to geopolitical tensions, have exacerbated inflationary pressures, prompting monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies. Positive Outlook for Industrial Market in 2022 Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, steady rental increases were observed across the board during the first quarter of this year, except for outlying business park space. Prime logistics properties continued to outperform, rising by 3.0% q-o-q in Q1 2022. Similarly, high-tech properties also experienced stable growth during the quarter. Rents of factories rose gradually in the first quarter of 2022 given relatively tight vacancy rates as the bulk of supply is only expected to come onstream in the latter part of the year. City fringe business park continued to experience steady growth amidst tight vacancy. On the other hand, outlying business parks rents edged lower during the quarter as vacancy rates remained elevated. Nonetheless, broad-based growth in rents is expected across different types of industrial properties this year despite rising downside risks. Specifically, rents for business parks in both the city fringe and outlying areas are projected to increase in 2022 with the former experiencing higher growth rate due to their limited supply. Similarly, continued healthy demand is expected for high-tech, prime logistics and warehouse properties amid ongoing expansion from the biomedical, technology, manufacturing and logistics sectors, fueled by the exponential growth in e-commerce and business digitalization. Ample supply of factory space coming onstream this year could add downward pressure on occupancy rates. Nevertheless, overall factory rents are still expected to rise in 2022, albeit at gradual rates as continued expansion in the manufacturing and logistics sectors would underpin healthy demand for factory space. Demand Supply Mis-match Sends Prime Logistics Rents Soaring A very tight supply situation has sent prime logistics rents soaring, rising 3.0% q-o-q in Q1 2022. According to C&W's basket of prime logistics properties, vacancy rates have fallen to below 5%. Third-party logistics players and end-users are actively looking for prime logistics space to meet stronger consumption demand and a ramp up of manufacturing production, especially for semiconductors amidst Singapore's re-opening of economic activities and global shortage of semiconductor chips. With little available supply, tenants are biting the bullet and accepting significant rental increases. Future supply of prime logistics assets remain limited in 2022 with only a few major projects in the pipeline such as 2PS1 (0.7 million sf (msf)), LOGOS Tuas Logistics Hub (AEI) (1.0 msf) and LOGOS Penjuru Logistics Centre (0.5 msf) among others. These projects are also substantially pre-committed. The current demand supply mis-match for prime logistics space could accelerate rental growth this year.

Overall Outlook Key observations Occupancy rates fell marginally but rental rates and prices continue to rise. After two years of increases, occupancy rates fell marginally by 0.4ppt q-o-q in 1Q22. Although demand continued to be healthy, the decline in the overall occupancy rate was attributed to the significant increase in new completions during the quarter. Total available stock increased by 333,000sqm in 1Q22, more than double the quarterly average in the last two years since the COVID-19 pandemic started. More than 75% (or c.251,000 sqm) of new stock added to the market was contributed by multiple-user factory space, the highest quarterly increase since the tracking of data begun in 1999. Consequently, the 1.4ppt increase in vacancy rates of multiple-user factories was the main contributor for the increase in the overall vacancy rates for industrial properties in 1Q22. Despite the dip in occupancy, rentals of industrial properties continued to rise, increasing 1.0% q-o-q. This is the strongest quarterly increase in the rental index in over eight years. In 1Q22, the warehouse segment posted the strongest growth in rents, rising 1.5% q-o-q. Prices of industrial space also continue to be on the uptrend, rising 2.1% q-o-q. Based on the number of caveats lodged, transaction volumes of industrial properties were 20% higher as compared to the previous year. Rollover of project completions from FY21. Even as the labour crunch situation in Singapore eased gradually over the course of FY21, construction delays continue to persist. An estimated 784,000sqm of new supply was rolled over from FY21, and an estimated 2.7m sqm of new stock is expected to come online in FY22. In 1Q22, 333,000sqm has been delivered and the remaining 2.4m sqm will consist mainly of single-user factories (46%) that are developed by industrialists for their own use. 28% of the upcoming supply will be in the form of multiple-user factories, 22% in the form of warehouses, and only 3% in the form of business parks. With the continued opening of borders and construction activity picking up, we are likely to see a fair bit of new stock added to the market, which would be significantly higher than the average 0.6m sqm of new supply added each year over the past three years. The spike in new supply this year could lead to vacancy rates creeping up and potentially put some pressure on rents going forward. What are we watching? Delivery of new supply in FY22. At the beginning of FY21, it was feared that the spike in new supply of industrial properties would put pressure on occupancy and rental rates. However, it did not materialise, as the prolonged COVID-19 outbreak led to construction delays. Although the labour crunch situation persists, further relaxation in border restrictions seems to have led to a pickup in construction activities, which will likely improve further as the year progresses. While it may still be too early to tell if the entire 2.7m sqm of new supply will be completed this year, we believe that the amount of new stock in FY22 will outpace that of the past two years. The 333,000sqm of new supply added to the market in 1Q22 alone was already almost half of the total supply of 669,000sqm that was completed in the whole of FY21. Although the bulk of the new supply projected to come online in FY22 is single-user factories that are typically built for industrialists' own use, the current economic uncertainties could lead to some slowdown in expansion plans for these businesses. This could, in turn, lead to single-user factories subletting some of its excess space and could put some pressure on the other industrial property segments. Slower rate of new completion expected beyond FY22. Looking further ahead, the new supply of industrial space that is projected to be completed is expected to be more subdued. Between FY23 and FY25, only slightly more than 500,000sqm of new stock is expected to be added to the market on an annual basis. As such, the spike in new completions expected in FY22 may put some pressure on occupancy and rents in the near term, but we believe that any excess supply will gradually be absorbed in the medium term.

Key Charts - Industrial Sector Spike in new supply in 2022F due to rollover from the past two years Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * A total of c.2.7m sqm of new industrial space is expected to be added to the market in FY22, the largest supply to be added in a single year. This is a result of a rollover in project completions from the last two years as the COVID-19 pandemic led to construction delays and disruptions to supply chains. * Only 669,000sqm of new supply was completed in the whole of FY21. The remaining 784,000sqm of new stock that was previously expected to be completed in FY21 has now been pushed to FY22. * Of the remaining c.2.4m sqm of new supply expected to hit the market over the next three quarters of FY22, c.46% will be single-user factory space that has likely been developed by industrialists for their own use. * Multiple-user factory space makes up another c.28% of the upcoming supply, and warehouses and business park spaces will contribute the remaining c.25% of the new stock. * Take-up of multiple-user and warehouse spaces has been healthy in FY21, but the spike in supply in FY22 may put some pressure on occupancy and rental rates. - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 000' sqm Supply Demand Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 4 . Spike in new supply in 2022 is expected to lead to negative net absorption Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * Net absorption in FY20 and FY21 were positive due to the delay in construction and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. * Although the amount of new industrial supply in FY21 was more than twice the amount seen in FY20, pent-up demand and expansion needs led to a slightly positive net absorption in FY21. * The positive net absorption in FY21 came from the multi-user factory and warehouse segments, and it was partially offset by the negative net absorption from the single-user factory and business park segments. * With c.2.7m sqm of new industrial supply expected to hit the market in FY22, we might see some negative net absorption. We believe that the negative net absorption will likely be contributed by the single-user and multiple-user factory segments, which are projected to deliver the bulk of the new supply this year. * In the medium term, net absorption could surprise on the upside as some construction delays persist. It may likely lead to some of the new supply in FY22 being rolled over to the following years and help spread out new stock more evenly and lessen pressure on vacancy rates. 8.1% 9.1% 9.4% 10.5% 11.1% 10.7% 10.8% 10.1% 10% 10% 11% 11% 0.0% 2.0% 4.0% 6.0% 8.0% 10.0% 12.0% (8) (6) (4) (2) - 2 4 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F m'sqft Net Suplus/(Net deficit) Vacancy Rate (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 5 .

Positive rental reversions for business parks have been tapering off in the past two years, and it remained flat in FY21. * Overall rentals in the near term are expected to remain relatively healthy as construction delays continue to limit the addition of new stock to the market. * Over the last two years, the logistics sector has been driven by the advancement of e-commerce and stockpiling activities.

Industrial Sub-sector - Multi-User Factory Multi-user factory supply: Supply spike in 2022F due to construction delays in previous two years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * The drop in new completions in FY21 led to a 170bps improvement in occupancy rates, and vacancy rates fell to a low of 9.8%, a level not seen in the past nine years. * Due to further construction delays in FY21, some new supply has been rolled over to FY22. This was likely the main reason for the robust increase in occupancy rates for the multiple-user factory space, to 90.2%. * As more delays caused some new supply to be rolled over to FY22, oversupply in the multiple-user factory space could likely lead to vacancy rates inching back up to c.11% in FY22 and FY23. * Occupancy rates could surprise on the upside in FY22 if the labour crunch situation persists and new supply is spread out more evenly over the next few years. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F m Sqft Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 7 .

The manufacturing slowdown decline reflected the lower PMI indices in recent months, although global demand for semiconductor and semiconductor equipment remained sustained. * The services sector also rose at a slower pace of 1.4% yoy in Q1 2022, compared to a growth of 5.6% in Q4 2021. * Singapore attracted S$1.7bn in FAI in Q4 2021, a decline from S$3.7bn in Q3 2021. The biomedical manufacturing cluster emerged as the leading sector during the quarter with a contribution of S$760mn of FAI. * In April 2022, MAS tightened the monetary policy by raising the exchange rate policy band at a higher level and raising the rate of appreciation, following its off-cycle move in January 2022. Amid the geopolitical situation and supply chain disruptions, the forecast ranges for core inflation and headline inflation were both raised to 2.5-3.5% and 4.5-5.5% respectively. * The labour market continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate improved to 2.4% in Q4 2021 from 2.6% in Q3 2021. Total employment rose by 40,200 in 2021, following the sharp contraction by 181,000 in 2020. In Q4 2021, total employment rose by 54,600, driven by improvements in the construction sector (+15,500) and other service industries (+9,400) bearing the brunt. The manufacturing sector also recorded its first increase in two years in Q4 2021. Similarly, the wholesale and retail trade, as well as the accommodation and food services sectors also posted employment growth following a few quarters of contraction. * As the economy moderates towards trend growth in the year ahead, certain sectors, such as construction, retail and food services, aviation and hospitality, are expected to see a recovery. The manufacturing sector will likely remain as a pillar of growth for the economy. * As at writing, 92% of the population has completed the full vaccination regime, while 71% have received a booster shot. This will safeguard the nation against the Covid variants. * In February 2022, MTI maintained the country's GDP growth forecast for 2022 at 4.0% to 6.0%. Significant safe management measures were relaxed in March, while a new Vaccinated Travel Framework came into place in April. The Omicron wave has likely peaked, and we expect stronger business and consumer confidence in the months ahead. The easing of borders should help alleviate the manpower crunch to some extent. Risks are skewed to the downside, given the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, inflation pressures and upward pressure on interest rates.

The transaction is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. * The collective sale of Tanglin Shopping Centre, which has office and retail components, was awarded to Pacific Eagle Real Estate for S$868mn. * Frasers Logistics and Commercial Trust (FLCT) divested Cross Street Exchange, a mixed-use commercial property, to an undisclosed third party for S$810.8mn. * RESIDENTIAL: The higher additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) rates are likely to trim developers' interest in large residential sites, since the risk of not selling all units is higher, and the associated penalties are now more punitive. * COMMERCIAL: The fresh easing of social, workplace, event and border restrictions will instill investors' stronger confidence in the commercial market. In addition, developers' interest is likely to spill over to non-residential investments like the commercial sector. With the popularity of mixed-use developments, commercial-zoned sites are garnering more attention from investors since the residential components of such sites are not subjected to ABSD or Qualifying Certificate (QC) rules. Despite URA's recent imposition of restrictions on strata subdivision to the commercial component in properties located in certain designated areas including CBD and Orchard Road corridors, any drastic impact on market sentiments is not expected as the profile of the investors of commercial developments in recent times remain mainly institutional with a mid- to long-term investment horizon. * RETAIL: While suburban retail assets are expected to continue to be sought after, the interest in prime assets, especially strata-titled properties and units, may be renewed due to its scarcity, which may in turn spur higher transaction activity. * OFFICE: While technology demand growth could slow temporarily in the months ahead, on the back of supply chain constraints/disruptions and the Chinese regulatory clampdown, we remain optimistic on the finance sector, especially the wealth management industry, as a key driver of office demand. With the increase of up to 75% of the workforce allowed back to the office and improving business sentiment on the back of a strong rebound in Singapore's economic growth last year, companies may reassess their office space needs. * INDUSTRIAL: Amid heightened geopolitical tensions and supply chain risks, stockpiling requirements are likely to increase. The investment demand for logistics facilities and warehouses is expected to remain strong in tandem with the e-commerce growth trend. However, investors may adopt a cautious approach toward rapid expansion amid the expected softening of global growth for 2022. 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH OFFICE - Riding on the back-to-office momentum 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2021 2022 2023 2024 Under Construction mn sq KEY HIGHLIGHTS Average monthly gross rents (SGD/sq ft) SUPPLY - SINGAPORE OFFICE SUPPLY (sq ft) OFFICE SUPPLY PIPELINE (2022-2025) (sq ft) As at Q4 2021, nearly 4.9mn sq ft of new office space will be completed from 2022 to 2025, an increase from 3.9mn sq ft as of Q3 2021.

The leasing demand for prime office spaces in the central area moderated as corporates held back on their real estate needs amid the new Omicron wave during the quarter. Nonetheless, robust demand for premium spaces in Raffles Place and Grade A office spaces in Shenton Way/Robinson Road/ Tanjong Pagar brought about higher occupancies, while other segments saw some softening. The overall occupancy rate for office spaces in the CBD rose by 0.7 percentage points to 93.6% in Q1 2022, which was a similar rate of increase compared to the previous quarter. * The limited supply of quality spaces continued to support rental growth across all subzones of the office sector in Q1 2022, albeit to various extents. In the CBD, premium rents at Marina Bay and Grade A rents at Raffles Place experienced the strongest uptick. Grade B rents at Shenton Way/Robinson Road/ Tanjong Pagar have also risen for the first time by 0.6% since Q1 2020. In non-CBD, rents across different subzones improved by 0.2%-0.5% qoq, while office rents in the decentralised rose by a modest 0.1%-0.2% qoq in Q1 2022. * Some of the major leasing deals in Q1 2022 included KPMG taking up around 100,000 sq ft in Asia Square Tower 2 and Sony Music's flagship regional headquarters at Duo Tower. The upcoming Guoco Midtown had also secured more tenants in the quarter. * Following URA's recent imposition of restrictions on strata subdivision to the commercial component in properties located in certain designated areas, including CBD and Orchard Road corridors, rents and prices of strata units are expected to rise due to scarcity in future supply. * While the growth in demand for the technology sector could slow temporarily in the months ahead due to the supply chain constraints/disruptions and the Chinese regulatory clampdown, we remain optimistic on the finance sector, especially the wealth management industry, as a key driver of office demand. * With up to 75% of workforce allowed back to the office and improved business sentiment driven by the strong rebound in Singapore's economic growth last year, companies are reassessing their office space needs. To accommodate future growth plans, adopt the hybrid working models, and address the employees' evolving requirements, companies might be looking for expansion in the current buildings or new spaces. * Barring the emergence of new Covid-19 variants, we expect the restrictions in the workplace may ease further by the end of the year, which may allow all employees to return to the office. Amid a tight supply pipeline, office demand will continue to strengthen, especially for good quality and sustainable spaces. 8 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL - Focus on decarbonisation and supply chain diversification 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 First-storey multiple-user factory Upper-storey multiple-user factory Hi-tech industrial space Business park (Central Region) $ psf 70 80 90 100 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Single-user factory Multiple-user factory Business park Warehouse % KEY HIGHLIGHTS RENTAL OF FIRST STOREY MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY OCCUPANCY RATE OF MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY F i r m p r o s p e c t s f o r t h e manufacturing sector drove the slight 0.6% qoq increase in rent.

The overall manufacturing sector has now recorded the 21st month of expansion, despite global growth's expected softening in 2022 amid heightened geopolitical tensions and supply chain risks. * On a 3-month moving average yoy basis, NODX grew by 15.3% yoy in February 2022, following a 19.9% rise in January 2022. Both the electronics and non- electronics sectors contracted. * Overall industrial net absorption decreased from 2.4mn sq ft in Q3 2021 to 0.2mn sq ft in Q4 2021, amid continued uncertainties surrounding global trade markets and looming inflation costs. The drivers were warehouse segment (0.4mn sq ft) and multiple-user factory segment (0.3mn sq ft). * Island-wide, occupancy rate for multiple-user factory increased 0.4% qoq to 90.2% in Q4 2021, whilst that of business park increased 0.2% qoq to 84.5% in Q4 2021. The rest of the occupancy rates for other industrial segments decreased by similar rates of 0.1% qoq in Q4 2021. * As of Q4 2021, approximately 59% of the supply pipeline will be completed in 2022, followed by 18% in 2023. Single-user factories accounted for the bulk (42%) of the supply pipeline with approximately 17.6mn sq ft NLA. Multiple-user factory space made up 31% of the supply pipeline, projected to be about 12.8mn sq ft NLA. * Amid robust manufacturing activity in Q1 2022, multiple-user factory rents rose by 0.3-0.6% qoq in the quarter. Buoyant demand for spaces with modern specifications pushed up rents by 0.6% qoq for hi-tech spaces in Q1 2022. * Stockpiling requirements are likely to increase amid heightened geopolitical tensions and supply chain risks, which will further increase the demand for logistics and warehouse facilities. It will also drive the push towards supply chain diversification to mitigate cost pressures and operating risks. * To achieve Singapore's new net-zero emission ambition by or around mid-century, it was announced during Budget 2022 that the carbon tax will be raised to S$25 per tonne in 2024 and 2025, and S$45 per tonne in 2026 and 2027 to reach S$50 to S$80 per tonne by 2030. More occupiers may be encouraged to change their business models toward decarbonisation and cost savings, while we expect to see more redevelopments of ageing assets into future-proof properties with higher specifications and sustainability features. * Amid flight to quality, prime logistics assets, high-tech factories and city-fringe business parks will continue to be sought-after, with rents and capital values expected to rise in tandem. * Despite the anticipated new supply of data centres coming onstream in response to the expected lifting of the data centre moratorium in Q2 2022, we expect continued rental growth due to tight supply in the near term amid strong demand. 10 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Development Location Developer NLA '000 sq ft Total Status 2021 A&A to existing Shaw Plaza Balestier Road Shaw Properties (1997) Pte Ltd 64 200 Under Construction A&A to Grantral Mall @ Macpherson Macpherson Road Wujie Times Square Pte Ltd 63 Boulevard 88 Cuscaden Road/ Orchard Boulevard Hong Leong Holdings, CDL and Lea Investments 30 Guoco Midtown Beach Rd Guoco Midtown Pte Ltd/ Midtown Bay Pte Ltd 23 Hotel/retail development Club Street Worldwide Hotels Group 20 2023 The Woodleigh Mall Upper Aljunied Road SPH and Kajima Development 150 455 Under construction Sengkang Grand Mall Compassvale Bow/ Sengkang Central CapitaLand and City Developments Limited 109 One Holland Village Holland Road Far East Organization, Sinoland, and Sekisui House 81 A&A to Changi Airport Terminal 2 Airport Boulevard Changi Airport Group (S) Pte Ltd 62 Dairy Farm Residences Dairy Farm Road United Engineers 30 Parc Komo/Komo Shoppes Upper Changi Road North/Jalan Mariam CEL Real Estate Development Pte Ltd 23 2024 Office/retail development Labrador Villa Road/ Pasir Panjang Road SP Group 26 26 PP: Sep-20 2025 Punggol Digital District Punggol Way JTC Corporation 173 173 WP: Oct-19 Total 854 SUPPLY OF RETAIL SPACES (2022-2025) (sq ft) The majority of the upcoming pipeline is the redevelopment of existing malls and ancillary retail, mainly from mixed-use office buildings and the retail podium from residential developments. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 2022 2023 2024 2025 Orchard/ Scotts Road Other City Areas Fringe/Suburban Areas '000 sq ft Source: URA, EDMUND TIE RETAIL - Brighter prospects with fresh easing of COVID measures KEY HIGHLIGHTS AVERAGE RETAIL RENTAL (SGD/sq ft) RETAIL OCCUPANCY RATES The average occupancy rate of retail spaces in Singapore remained unchanged in Q4 2021.

The overall occupancy rate remained constant at 91.9% in Q4 2021. * The occupancy rate for the Fringe/Suburban Area improved by 0.1% points to 93.9% in Q4 2021, the sixth quarter of consecutive increase since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. * In Q1 2022, rents for Fringe/Suburban continued to outperform and rose by 1.3% qoq, compared to a slower growth of 0.5% qoq in Orchard/Scotts Road and marginal growth in rental rates of 0.3% in Other City Areas. * Retail openings in Q1 2022 included Japanese furniture brand Nitori Retail's first Singapore store at Courts Nojima at The Hereen, Uniqlo at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, and Pepper Lunch GO! at 313@Somerset. Retail closures included Dunkin' Donuts temporarily closing all their outlets in Singapore, Isetan at Parkway Parade, and Marks & Spencer at 313@Somerset. * The 3-month moving average of yoy change in retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) has risen from 6.8% in October 2021 to 9.6% in January 2022. Retail sales for Petrol Service Stations, Wearing Apparel & Footwear and Watches & Jewellery experienced the greatest improvement yoy in Q4 2021. The majority of the retail trade categories experienced a positive growth except for Mini-marts & Convenience Stores, Others and Optical Goods & Books, which were the only three categories that experienced losses. * For the food and beverage services index for Q4 2021, Restaurants was the sole component that reported a decline of 5.3% yoy due to the dining restrictions. Food Caterers recorded the greatest improvement, increasing by 42.2% yoy in Q4 2021 followed by Cafes, Food Courts & Other Eating Places which rose by 4.2% yoy. * We expect the fresh easing of social, event and border restrictions to improve retail sentiment and boost consumer confidence, which will further improve retail sales. * In particular, the increased dining capacity to 10 fully vaccinated people is a welcome move for the F&B sector, though the current requirement for safe distancing of 1m between tables means that eating outlets are still not be able to operate at full capacity. * As a result of URA's recent imposition of restrictions on strata subdivision to the commercial component in properties located in certain designated areas, including CBD and Orchard Road corridors, demand and occupancy of prime retail assets may keep steady or even improve amid the limited supply of existing strata malls. * The latest strata policy change may also improve the tenant diversity of malls and allows for more effective control of the mall's positioning under single ownership, which may drive higher footfall and spending. As a result, malls in the designated areas may enjoy lower vacancy rates and command higher rents over time. * As Singapore further reopens its borders with the lifting of most restrictions for fully vaccinated visitors, the anticipated return of more tourists will inject greater optimism for the recovery of the retail sector, especially in the Central Area. 12 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Q1 2011 Q3 2011 Q1 2012 Q3 2012 Q1 2013 Q3 2013 Q1 2014 Q3 2014 Q1 2015 Q3 2015 Q1 2016 Q3 2016 Q1 2017 Q3 2017 Q1 2018 Q3 2018 Q1 2019 Q3 2019 Q1 2020 Q3 2020 Q1 2021 Q3 2021 Residential pipeline Total unsold Years to clear unsold based on 3-year moving average for new sales per annum (RHS) Years '000 units 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 201120122013201420152016201720182019202020212022 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Units RESIDENTIAL - Price growth to soften in the wake of cooling measures 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 Q1 2011 Q1 2012 Q1 2013 Q1 2014 Q1 2015 Q1 2016 Q1 2017 Q1 2018 Q1 2019 Q1 2020 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 All Residential Price Index Landed Non-landed 1Q 2009 = 100 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 Q1 2011 Q1 2012 Q1 2013 Q1 2014 Q1 2015 Q1 2016 Q1 2017 Q1 2018 Q1 2019 Q1 2020 Q1 2021 Primary sales Secondary sales Residential launches* Units KEY HIGHLIGHTS PROPERTY PRICE INDEX OF ALL PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES RESIDENTIAL PIPELINE SUPPLY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SALES TRANSACTION VOLUME PRIVATE HOME RENTAL TRANSACTIONS In Q1 2022, based on URA's flash estimate, the overall Property Price Index (PPI) for private residential proper ties rose for the eight consecutive quarter by 0.4% qoq, a moderation from Q4 2021's 5.0%. Landed property prices rose by 4.0% qoq while non-landed property prices corrected by 0.6% qoq. The pipeline supply for private homes rose by 2.8% qoq in Q4 2021. The total number of unsold units rose slightly by 0.3% qoq and we expect the units to be absorbed in 2.0 years. Based on caveats lodged between 1 Jan 2022 and 31 Mar 2022, overall sales transaction volumes for private residential units decreased by 42% qoq in Q1 2022 in the wake of the cooling measures. The transaction volumes for both the primary and secondary markets declined qoq, by 43% and 42% respectively. The number of private rental transactions grew significantly by 6.6% to a record high in 2021, driven by completion delays within the construction sector, which created demand for rental units. Rental transactions fell by 11.9% qoq in Q4 2021 and by 39% qoq in Q1 2022. Q1 2021 14,619 units Q4 2021 23,915 units Q1 2022 (URA flash estimate) 174.3 Q4 2021 173.6 Q1 2022 4,568 units Q4 2021 7,925 units Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA * Residential launch data for Q1 2022 is based on new launches in Jan 2022 and Feb 2022 only.

Prices for the landed properties rose by 4.0%, while the non-landed prices fell by 0.6%. Besides the impact of the cooling measures, the softer non-landed prices were also a result of the dearth of new launches during the quarter. There were two new projects launched in Q1 2022, Royal Hallmark in the RCR and Ikigai in the CCR. * Based on caveats lodged, new sales and secondary transaction volumes dipped 44% and 49% qoq respectively in Q1 2022. Within both the new sales and secondary sales market, the decline in activity was broad-based and similar across the market segments. * The price movements across the market segments reflect the expected immediate impact of the cooling measures on investment demand. The CCR, which has the highest foreign share of demand, fell by 0.5% qoq. On the other hand, the suburban OCR segment continued to see prices rising by 1.9% qoq, albeit at a slower pace compared with 5.7% a quarter ago. Our price analysis showed that median prices were more resilient in the secondary market, rising by 0.4% qoq in Q1 2022, while median prices in the primary market declined by 1.7% qoq. * The pipeline supply for private residential homes rose by 2.8% qoq as of Q4 2021. The total number of unsold units rose slightly by 0.3% qoq to 21,612 units and we expect the unsold units to be absorbed in 2 years, based on the average sales pace over the last three years. The tight supply situation will continue to lend pricing power to developers. * Private rental transactions grew significantly by 6.6% to a record high in 2021, driven by the continual ongoing uncertainties within the construction sector, which created the demand for rental units. Rental transactions fell by 11.9% qoq in Q4 2021 and 39% qoq in Q1 2022. The marked decline in Q1 2022 was broad-based across the three market segments and is likely due to the low vacancies in the market. Some expatriates may have taken the opportunity to return to their home countries, expecting to return with ease as the border restrictions are relaxed. * We expect price growth to moderate with the imposition of the latest cooling measures to promote housing affordability and curb market exuberance. However, we do not expect strong pressures on developers to reduce prices, especially for projects with limited unsold inventory. * Looking ahead, the tightening of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) could divert some demand towards suburban homes, which are more affordable. We also expect some rotation of demand from RCR to OCR in 2022, given the strong price increases in RCR in 2021. * Demand will continue to be largely supported by local first-time home buyers and HDB upgraders, who are least impacted by the cooling measures. Stable economic prospects and an improving job market in 2022 will further support the demand for private homes. * However, we expect sales momentum to slow, on the back of fewer units from new launches in 2022. Developers will likely exercise more caution in bidding for land parcels over the next few months. We expect a recovery in launch and sales activity in H2 2022, if the collective sales market stabilises. * While the cooling measures will dampen sales momentum, the overall market remains supported by a robust labour market, ongoing economic growth, and healthy demand-supply dynamics in the property market. The nation is also better prepared to face new Covid challenges, given the high vaccination rates and booster programme. Our base projection is a slight correction of the primary sales to about 11,000 - 12,000 units for 2022. * With the VTL and resumption of air travel bringing more expatriates, foreign workers, and students back to Singapore, we foresee rental demand to strengthen in 2022. However, as the shortage of manpower in the construction sector is gradually resolved, demand for short-term rentals could decline. The completion of new projects could slow the rate of rental increases. Editor: Authors: Lam Chern Woon Senior Direct"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Prime rents, however, registered moderate growth in the quarter as new completions remain limited due to construction delays, whilst leasing demand was firm. * There were no residential collective sales concluded in the Prime districts during the quarter as developers remain cautious amidst market uncertainty. However, they are still interested in replenishing land banks, and are more likely to consider smaller sites which involve lower market risks. * Prime rents are expected to remain on an uptrend for the next 12 months, as the recent easing of border restrictions and improved hiring of foreigners continue to feed leasing demand.

Warehouse * Logistics/warehouse facilities experienced healthy demand in 1Q22, supported largely by requirements for general storage and cold/temperature-control purposes from third-party logistics service providers (3PLs), life sciences and e-commerce companies. * Driven by tight space availability, especially for better quality warehouse premises, the average island wide logistics/warehouse rent rose for the fourth consecutive quarter in 1Q22 and this supported another quarter of capital value growth. * Barring unforeseen shocks, we expect rents and capital values to stay on an uptrend for the rest of 2022, underpinned by tight space availability for continued buying interest for this asset class.

Despite a net weighted balance of 8% of manufacturers foreseeing a favourable business outlook in H1 2022, supported by the encouraging pace of growth in 2021, the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war since February this year might further aggravate already-con- strained global supply chains. The disrupted supply of rare metals and neon from the warring nations that many semiconductor manufacturers rely on to produce chips are rapidly being exhausted in existing inventories. The ripple effect of the conflict could draw out the global chip shortage longer than expected, affecting growth. In addition, COVID-19 lockdowns in China as well as rising inflation have been some of the other critical factors dampening manufacturers' sentiments. In March 2022, the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered a slower rate of expansion at 50.1, representing declines of 0.7 points y-o-y and 0.1 point m-o-m. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in January and February 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against October and November 2021) and y-o-y (against January and February 2021). Land in excess of 100,000 sf remains high in demand, stemming from end-users in need of larger parcels and buildings for expansion. Notwithstanding this, the current supply of good quality industrial buildings is limited, resulting in the tapering of total sales to S$431.2 million in the first three months of the year (Exhibit 1). In January and February 2022, leasing activity in the industrial market generally picked up 4.9% on a y-o-y basis. Strata industrial space remained particularly popular among businesses due to the more palatable floor areas and price quantums. While demand for such space remains healthy, the pace of leasing movements slowed. The multiple-user factory segment registered 1,557 tenancies in the first two months of the year, representing a marginal decline of 0.4% y-o-y, although the reduction was in part due to the high-base last year when the total number of leases hit new heights of 1,564 (January and February 2021), not seen since 2012 (Exhibit 2).

Earlier in October 2021, twinned bases - Batamindo Industrial Park (BIP) and Bintan Industrial Estate (BIE) - were established between Singapore and Indonesia. And more recently in February 2022, another initiative was introduced in Singapore and Vietnam known as the Sembcorp Development's Vietnam Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs). These will help manufacturers who are looking to grow their businesses and adapt strategies that could potentially increase their output production more efficiently and effectively. With external forces exacerbating the global semiconductor supply crunch, manufacturers may turn cautious when considering expansion activities. However, as e-commerce has proven sustainable, especially in this day and age where economies are steadily progressing towards being digital, the demand for logistics and warehouse space is expected to remain stable. Between 2022 and 2026, some 50.8 million sf of new industrial GFA will be coming on stream to the sector. Of the 29.9 million sf set to be completed sometime this year, single-user factory is projected to account for the lion's share of the upcoming supply, with approximately 13.1 million sf of new space (43.8%). Notwithstanding the upcoming supply in 2022, healthy demand and measured expansion in the industrial market continue to be underpinned by encouraging levels of direct investment from the biomedical, biotechnology and electronics sectors. As such, industrial price and rents are on track to improve in a moderate manner by 3% to 5% for the whole of 2022.

GDP increased by 3.7% y-o-y thus far in the first three months of 2022, supported by the 7.1% y-o-y growth of the manufacturing sector. This was primarily led by strong output expansions within the electronics and precision engineering clusters in Q1 as global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment remained robust. Nonetheless, business sentiments have moderated. According to Singstat's Business Expectations report for the manufacturing sector, overall, a net weighted balance of +2% of manufacturing firms foresee a favourable business outlook for the period April to September 2022, lower than the preceding net weighted balance of +8% recorded in the previous quarter. As such, despite dampened business sentiments due to prolonged global uncertainties, the electronics industry continues to grow, boosting performance in the overall manufacturing sector as the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) posted an expansion of 50.3 in June 2022. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in April and May 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against January and February 2022) and y-o-y (against April and May 2021). Overall, the pace of industrial sales has slowed down. In Q2 2022, total transactions amounted to S$661.5 million, representing declines of 4.9% and 30.2% on a q-o-q and y-o-y basis respectively. Multiple-user factory spaces, posing as one of the more affordable industrial assets, continued to register healthy levels of sales, bringing the average price to S$439 psf (Exhibit 1). One of the main contributors to the demand for industrial space is the food industry, where occupiers are actively on the lookout for food factories and central kitchens in Singapore. With rising global concerns on food security, as well as access to raw materials and necessities, stockpiling activity has increased. The strengthening Singapore dollar provided support for stockpiling, mitigating escalation in costs as inflation becomes significant. The need for space to support the increase in firms' inventories expanded demand for warehouse space, evident from the 212 rental transactions recorded for such space in just April 2022 alone (Exhibit 2). Historically, this leasing volume stands as the highest number of tenancies on a monthly basis since data became available, bringing the cumulative median rental for warehouse to S$1.85 psf pm in April and May.

In April 2022, the redevelopment of Pokka's regional headquarters commenced. To be completed by Q1 2024, the new state-of-the-art building will house an innovation and incubation hub with sustainable features and facilities. More recently in May 2022, Singapore's first eco-friendly manufacturing hub, Green Lab, spanning some 200,000 sf officially opened. Envisioned to be a one-stop production plant, the facility will manufacture some of Singapore's first fully compostable plant-based bags that could potentially replace existing plastic ones. Fraser and Neave (F&N), who owns a 60% stake in Green Lab through its publishing arm, Times Publishing, will be switching the packaging of its in-house brands and products to the sustainable alternatives produced. Despite existing global and regional uncertainties, bright spots continue to highlight the industrial market. The persisting chip shortage globally will continue to generate demand for electronics, and the transport engineer- ing cluster will benefit from the increased demand for air travel as travel accelerates in many parts of the world. Thus, prices and rentals for industrial space remain on track to grow 3% to 5% for the whole of 2022. In tandem with these initiatives, JTC has also introduced solar deployment models, helping industries to transition towards sustainable and renewable energy sources through the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. To facilitate solar energy adoption, solar deployment will be mandatory for certain sites that meet the requirements set by the government agency.

While the services-producing industries grew by 4.2% YoY in Q1, overall economic growth was led by the 6.3% YoY recovery in the goods-producing industries. Alongside a robust expansion of 2.1% YoY for the construction sector, manufacturing grew signifi cantly by 7.1% YoY. The manufacturing sector has ended the fi rst quarter with growth moderation, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipping from 50.7 in December to 50.1 in March. The Russia-Ukraine confl ict created a fallout with rising energy costs, supply chain disruptions and infl ationary pressures on many fronts, clouding market sentiments and business planning. The growth in Singapore's key exports also slowed down, with non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rising 7.7% YoY in March, compared to 18.4% in December. RENTAL MARKET The quarterly leasing volume1 continued to increase, rising to 3,054 transactions in Q1/2022. However, the pace of growth slowed to 3.5% YoY. While single-user factory segment remained the key demand driver of the industrial rental market, the YoY growth in tenancies signed moderated from 63.0% in Q4/2021 to 39.7% in Q1/2022. The multiple- user factory and warehouse segments continued to see steady take-up from digital and creative fi rms, as well as ecommerce and third-party logistics (3PL) companies. As most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generally prefer prime locations, the vacancy rate for multiple-user factory spaces in the Central Region fell to its lowest level (9.0%) of the last nine years. Despite the increase in overall occupier demand (+724,000 sq ft) in Q1/2022, the island-wide vacancy for multiple-user factory spaces of 11.2% has not been higher since Q4/2020. This was largely due to the addition of new supply from the partial completion of JTC Defu Industrial City. Meanwhile, the vacancy rate for single-user factories and warehouses remained relatively fi rm in Q1/2022, inching up to 9.6% (+0.2% ppt QoQ) and 9.7% (+0.3 ppt QoQ) respectively. Compared with the previous quarter, rents continued to increase across all industrial segments in Q1/2022. The JTC's rental index for factory hit a post-2017 record and the Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 increased by 3.6% QoQ to S$1.90 per sq ft in Q1/2022. Although 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. the JTC's rental index for warehouses rose, the Savills' average monthly rent for prime warehouses and logistics properties3 recorded a marginal decline of 0.7% QoQ to S$1.45 per sq ft in Q1/2022. While landlords of modern warehouse facilities are still holding up their rental expectations, the overall rental decline was largely due to the decrease in rents in some of the strata-titled warehouse properties in our basket. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 fell 8% from 460 transactions in Q1/2021 to 423 transactions in Q1/2022. Notwithstanding the decline in sales, this is still well above the historical fi ve-year average sales (279 caveats). The steady sales momentum was likely backed by local SMEs which acquired multiple-user factory and warehouse properties for their own business operations, especially those in the electronics, manufacturing, biomedical, healthcare, ecommerce, and last mile transportation services. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for freehold properties increased by 1.1% QoQ to S$729 per sq ft while that of 60-year leasehold units rose by 0.9% QoQ to S$447 per sq ft in Q1/2022. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, 30- year leasehold industrial properties increased by a faster pace at 3.5% QoQ to S$305 per sq ft in Q4, ending six consecutive years of year-on-year price declines. The overall price growth could be backed by ample liquidity in the market. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL The island-wide vacancy level for business park space fell by 1.1 ppt QoQ to 14.4% in Q1/2022, the lowest since Q4/2020. Owing to the healthy take-up rate of prime business park developments such as Mapletree Business City and one-north, the vacancy rate in the Central Planning Region eased further by 2.3 ppts QoQ to a record low at 6.2% in Q1/2022. Coupled with the scarcity and steady demand in Mapletree Business City and one-north regions, Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents rose by 0.6% QoQ to S$5.89 per sq ft. While the vacancy rate in the West Planning Region fell by 1.8 ppt QoQ to 28.1% in Q1/2022, that in the East Planning Region continued to worsen to 24.2% (+2.3 ppts QoQ) due to softer demand from ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee and Changi Business Park.

Hence, Savills' standard business park properties6 monthly rents slipped by 0.1% QoQ to S$4.00 per sq ft in Q1/2022. What was interesting was that some fi rms upgraded from fl atted factories to more prime and accessible high-spec industrial developments and yet managed to achieve rental savings by rightsizing and consolidating operations from various locations. Particularly, new high- spec industrial projects such as UBIX and other well-located developments continue to experience good take-up rates. These market movements could have helped generate rental growth, resulting in an increase of 1.4% QoQ in the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket7 to S$3.61 per sq ft in Q1/2022. OUTLOOK In the face of more economic challenges such as high infl ation and the worldwide energy crunch, the Russia-Ukraine confl ict has clouded the early-2022 optimistic outlook for Singapore's post- COVID recovery. While the immediate impact on the local economy has been manageable, the longer-term impact of the confl ict on Singapore's economy will depend on how the situation unfolds. Notwithstanding the global headwinds, industrial and logistics emerged as one of the most 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. multiple-user factory rents are expected to see some recovery this year, warehouse and logistics real estate is expected to better weather the increased downside risks and negative feedback eff ects arising from the Russia-Ukraine crisis. As such, rents for prime warehouse properties is forecast to grow by up to 5% this year, with the demand for modern warehouse facilities coming from new economy industries likely to stay fi rm. Taking the abovementioned factors into account, rent for prime multiple-user factory and warehouse & logistics properties is forecast to grow by up to 2% and 5% respectively in 2022.

In particular, demand for modern warehouse facilities and high-specifi cation industrial facilities is likely to sustain. Some of the upcoming modern warehouse developments saw healthy pre-commitment levels. For instance, 2 Pioneer Sector 1 (2PS1) is already more than 70% pre-committed from tenants in the Fast- Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), e-commerce and third-party logistics (3PL) industries. As the supply of modern warehouse facilities with quality specifi cations is expected to remain limited in the near term due to construction delays, demand for such high-specifi cation facilities is expected to hold up overall rental growth. Nonetheless, industrialists may generally be more cautious with their expansion plans alongside the global semiconductor supply crunch and heightened uncertainty. Considering rising labour costs and elevated commodity prices, higher business costs could curtail manufacturing activity and any expansion of footprint. While Industrial"}], "max_tokens": 10}}
