Backed by strong government support, Colliers expects more firms to set up their manufacturing hubs in Singapore, with sustained growth in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors to underpin demand for factory space in 2022. However, geopolitical tensions have resulted in rising energy costs and supply chain disruptions, causing inflationary pressures and clouding the outlook of the manufacturing sector. As such, manufacturers might also become more cautious in their expansion plans. 2 All Industrial The JTC All Industrial price and rental indices continued their sixth consecutive quarter of growth in Q1 2022, reaching their highest levels since the beginning of 2017. Trade indicators have exhibited a similar trend, with expansion recorded in manufacturing output, NODX and PMI, albeit with growth moderating. Warehouse Warehouses registered the highest rental increase of 1.5% QOQ among all the segments. Colliers has observed that demand for prime logistics space and high specification warehouses has been extremely high; third party logistics players and end users have been actively looking for additional storage space to meet stronger consumption post-Covid, especially amidst supply chain disruptions and a global shortage of semi-conductor chips. As such, older warehouses may be taken off the market to be upgraded or redeveloped to meet the demand for these assets. Business Parks Business parks rents have remained flat, improving from last quarter's 0.5% decline. Strong net absorption has led to occupancy increasing by 110 pp this quarter, led by take-up at city fringe business parks. With the limited supply of quality offices and higher office rents, more demand from the tech and services industries could continue to spillover to city fringe business parks.

In addition to 25.90 mil sf more industrial space scheduled to complete this year, the average annual pipeline supply from present to 2025 at 12.92 mil sf, is almost double the 6.46 mil sf over the past three years. This anticipated surge in supply could slow price and rental growth, while providing more options for industrialists at the same time. With most Singapore residents vaccinated, there will likely be less storage space required for medical products. Older warehouses are also seeing resistance to rental increases from small and medium enterprises. All these factors might cause warehouse rental growth to taper in the coming quarters. Nevertheless, demand for industrial assets, especially high specification warehouses and business parks, should still be underpinned by growth industries such as the food, media, logistics, technology and biomedical sectors. Further, the drive for more robust supply chains, the switch to a just-in-case strategy, as well as the increasing digitalisation of industries and the economy should continue to support industrial rent and price growth, albeit at a more measured pace.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Singapore Maintains Stable Growth Forecast for 2022 According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Singapore's economy expanded by 7.6% y-o-y in 2021, faster than an advance estimate of 7.2%. GDP growth in 2021 was driven mainly by the manufacturing, information & communications, finance & insurance as well as wholesale trade sectors. Full-year 2021 manufacturing growth reached 13.2%, extending the 7.5% expansion in the preceding year. Singapore maintained its growth forecast for this year at 3% to 5%. However, downside risks have increased as the ongoing global supply bottlenecks alongside rising energy prices due to geopolitical tensions, have exacerbated inflationary pressures, prompting monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies. Positive Outlook for Industrial Market in 2022 Based on C&W's basket of industrial properties, steady rental increases were observed across the board during the first quarter of this year, except for outlying business park space. Prime logistics properties continued to outperform, rising by 3.0% q-o-q in Q1 2022. Similarly, high-tech properties also experienced stable growth during the quarter. Rents of factories rose gradually in the first quarter of 2022 given relatively tight vacancy rates as the bulk of supply is only expected to come onstream in the latter part of the year. City fringe business park continued to experience steady growth amidst tight vacancy. On the other hand, outlying business parks rents edged lower during the quarter as vacancy rates remained elevated. Nonetheless, broad-based growth in rents is expected across different types of industrial properties this year despite rising downside risks. Specifically, rents for business parks in both the city fringe and outlying areas are projected to increase in 2022 with the former experiencing higher growth rate due to their limited supply. Similarly, continued healthy demand is expected for high-tech, prime logistics and warehouse properties amid ongoing expansion from the biomedical, technology, manufacturing and logistics sectors, fueled by the exponential growth in e-commerce and business digitalization. Ample supply of factory space coming onstream this year could add downward pressure on occupancy rates. Nevertheless, overall factory rents are still expected to rise in 2022, albeit at gradual rates as continued expansion in the manufacturing and logistics sectors would underpin healthy demand for factory space. Demand Supply Mis-match Sends Prime Logistics Rents Soaring A very tight supply situation has sent prime logistics rents soaring, rising 3.0% q-o-q in Q1 2022. According to C&W's basket of prime logistics properties, vacancy rates have fallen to below 5%. Third-party logistics players and end-users are actively looking for prime logistics space to meet stronger consumption demand and a ramp up of manufacturing production, especially for semiconductors amidst Singapore's re-opening of economic activities and global shortage of semiconductor chips. With little available supply, tenants are biting the bullet and accepting significant rental increases. Future supply of prime logistics assets remain limited in 2022 with only a few major projects in the pipeline such as 2PS1 (0.7 million sf (msf)), LOGOS Tuas Logistics Hub (AEI) (1.0 msf) and LOGOS Penjuru Logistics Centre (0.5 msf) among others. These projects are also substantially pre-committed. The current demand supply mis-match for prime logistics space could accelerate rental growth this year.

After two years of increases, occupancy rates fell marginally by 0.4ppt q-o-q in 1Q22. Although demand continued to be healthy, the decline in the overall occupancy rate was attributed to the significant increase in new completions during the quarter. Total available stock increased by 333,000sqm in 1Q22, more than double the quarterly average in the last two years since the COVID-19 pandemic started. More than 75% (or c.251,000 sqm) of new stock added to the market was contributed by multiple-user factory space, the highest quarterly increase since the tracking of data begun in 1999. Consequently, the 1.4ppt increase in vacancy rates of multiple-user factories was the main contributor for the increase in the overall vacancy rates for industrial properties in 1Q22. Despite the dip in occupancy, rentals of industrial properties continued to rise, increasing 1.0% q-o-q. This is the strongest quarterly increase in the rental index in over eight years. In 1Q22, the warehouse segment posted the strongest growth in rents, rising 1.5% q-o-q. Prices of industrial space also continue to be on the uptrend, rising 2.1% q-o-q. Based on the number of caveats lodged, transaction volumes of industrial properties were 20% higher as compared to the previous year. Rollover of project completions from FY21. Even as the labour crunch situation in Singapore eased gradually over the course of FY21, construction delays continue to persist. An estimated 784,000sqm of new supply was rolled over from FY21, and an estimated 2.7m sqm of new stock is expected to come online in FY22. In 1Q22, 333,000sqm has been delivered and the remaining 2.4m sqm will consist mainly of single-user factories (46%) that are developed by industrialists for their own use. 28% of the upcoming supply will be in the form of multiple-user factories, 22% in the form of warehouses, and only 3% in the form of business parks. With the continued opening of borders and construction activity picking up, we are likely to see a fair bit of new stock added to the market, which would be significantly higher than the average 0.6m sqm of new supply added each year over the past three years. The spike in new supply this year could lead to vacancy rates creeping up and potentially put some pressure on rents going forward. What are we watching? Delivery of new supply in FY22. At the beginning of FY21, it was feared that the spike in new supply of industrial properties would put pressure on occupancy and rental rates. However, it did not materialise, as the prolonged COVID-19 outbreak led to construction delays. Although the labour crunch situation persists, further relaxation in border restrictions seems to have led to a pickup in construction activities, which will likely improve further as the year progresses. While it may still be too early to tell if the entire 2.7m sqm of new supply will be completed this year, we believe that the amount of new stock in FY22 will outpace that of the past two years. The 333,000sqm of new supply added to the market in 1Q22 alone was already almost half of the total supply of 669,000sqm that was completed in the whole of FY21. Although the bulk of the new supply projected to come online in FY22 is single-user factories that are typically built for industrialists' own use, the current economic uncertainties could lead to some slowdown in expansion plans for these businesses. This could, in turn, lead to single-user factories subletting some of its excess space and could put some pressure on the other industrial property segments. Slower rate of new completion expected beyond FY22. Looking further ahead, the new supply of industrial space that is projected to be completed is expected to be more subdued. Between FY23 and FY25, only slightly more than 500,000sqm of new stock is expected to be added to the market on an annual basis. As such, the spike in new completions expected in FY22 may put some pressure on occupancy and rents in the near term, but we believe that any excess supply will gradually be absorbed in the medium term.

This is a result of a rollover in project completions from the last two years as the COVID-19 pandemic led to construction delays and disruptions to supply chains. * Only 669,000sqm of new supply was completed in the whole of FY21. The remaining 784,000sqm of new stock that was previously expected to be completed in FY21 has now been pushed to FY22. * Of the remaining c.2.4m sqm of new supply expected to hit the market over the next three quarters of FY22, c.46% will be single-user factory space that has likely been developed by industrialists for their own use. * Multiple-user factory space makes up another c.28% of the upcoming supply, and warehouses and business park spaces will contribute the remaining c.25% of the new stock. * Take-up of multiple-user and warehouse spaces has been healthy in FY21, but the spike in supply in FY22 may put some pressure on occupancy and rental rates. - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F 000' sqm Supply Demand Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 4 . Spike in new supply in 2022 is expected to lead to negative net absorption Source: JTC Corporation, DBS Bank * Net absorption in FY20 and FY21 were positive due to the delay in construction and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. * Although the amount of new industrial supply in FY21 was more than twice the amount seen in FY20, pent-up demand and expansion needs led to a slightly positive net absorption in FY21. * The positive net absorption in FY21 came from the multi-user factory and warehouse segments, and it was partially offset by the negative net absorption from the single-user factory and business park segments. * With c.2.7m sqm of new industrial supply expected to hit the market in FY22, we might see some negative net absorption. We believe that the negative net absorption will likely be contributed by the single-user and multiple-user factory segments, which are projected to deliver the bulk of the new supply this year. * In the medium term, net absorption could surprise on the upside as some construction delays persist.

This was likely the main reason for the robust increase in occupancy rates for the multiple-user factory space, to 90.2%. * As more delays caused some new supply to be rolled over to FY22, oversupply in the multiple-user factory space could likely lead to vacancy rates inching back up to c.11% in FY22 and FY23. * Occupancy rates could surprise on the upside in FY22 if the labour crunch situation persists and new supply is spread out more evenly over the next few years. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022F 2023F 2024F m Sqft Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 7 . Multi-user factories: Occupancy facing some downward pressure from spike in new supply Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * Rentals declined marginally in 2020 mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have since seen a rebound in FY21 due to healthy demand and limited new supply. * In FY21, occupancy rates improved 170bps to 90.2% and rental rates improved 2.0% to S$1.90psf due to the limited new supply and construction delays. * However, as the delivery of new supply is expected to spike in FY22, we expect occupancy and rental rates to face some downward pressure. * This has been evident in 1Q22 as the occupancy rate trended downward due to the delivery of new supply, while rents continue to remain healthy and inch up marginally. * Again, occupancy and rents could surprise on the upside if construction delays continue to persist and new supply continues to be rolled over to the next year. 85% 86% 87% 88% 89% 90% 91% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022f 2023f 2024f 2025f 1Q18 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 S$ psf pm Multi-User Factory Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 8 .

Warehouses: Despite some new supply coming online, occupancy and rental rates are expected to remain robust Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * After six years of consecutive declines in rents, rental rates for warehouses started to pick up from early FY21, as supply was absorbed, boosted by demand for stockpiling and growth of the logistics sector. * Riding on the surge in demand for storage and delays in completion of new supply, occupancy rates continued to inch up by 10bps to c.90% in FY21. * Although some new supply is expected to come online in FY22, we expect overall warehouse occupancy and rental rates to continue inching up, driven by the continued expansion in the logistics sector. * However, we could start to see a divergence in occupancy and rental performance between the modern logistics warehouses and the older general warehouses, which could face stiff competition. 85% 86% 87% 88% 89% 90% 91% 92% 93% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022f 2023f 1Q18 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 S$ psf pm Warehouse Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 10 . Industrial Sub-sector - Business Parks Majority of business park space has been pre-committed Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * Even though there has been some addition to the supply of business parks in FY21, demand was also strong, as most of the new projects were pre-committed; and also due to the lack of new supply over the past two years. * As such, occupancy rates improved by 210bps to c.83.7% in FY21 as vacant space is gradually backfilled. * Looking ahead, the lack of new supply of business park space in FY22 could lead to it outperforming the other segments as technology, biomedical, and consumer goods tenants continue to drive demand. * Although some new supply is expected by FY23, we believe that most of it has already been pre-committed, and we believe occupancy and rental rates could continue its uptrend. * As business parks in the city fringe precincts of Buona Vista and Alexandra, which are favoured over the rest of the island, we believe that these areas will outperform business parks in the other areas such as Jurong, Changi, and Tuas. 70% 75% 80% 85% 90% 95% 100% (50) - 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022F 2024F Sqm Demand Supply Vacancy Rate (%) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 11 .

The manufacturing slowdown decline reflected the lower PMI indices in recent months, although global demand for semiconductor and semiconductor equipment remained sustained. * The services sector also rose at a slower pace of 1.4% yoy in Q1 2022, compared to a growth of 5.6% in Q4 2021. * Singapore attracted S$1.7bn in FAI in Q4 2021, a decline from S$3.7bn in Q3 2021. The biomedical manufacturing cluster emerged as the leading sector during the quarter with a contribution of S$760mn of FAI. * In April 2022, MAS tightened the monetary policy by raising the exchange rate policy band at a higher level and raising the rate of appreciation, following its off-cycle move in January 2022. Amid the geopolitical situation and supply chain disruptions, the forecast ranges for core inflation and headline inflation were both raised to 2.5-3.5% and 4.5-5.5% respectively. * The labour market continued to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate improved to 2.4% in Q4 2021 from 2.6% in Q3 2021. Total employment rose by 40,200 in 2021, following the sharp contraction by 181,000 in 2020. In Q4 2021, total employment rose by 54,600, driven by improvements in the construction sector (+15,500) and other service industries (+9,400) bearing the brunt. The manufacturing sector also recorded its first increase in two years in Q4 2021. Similarly, the wholesale and retail trade, as well as the accommodation and food services sectors also posted employment growth following a few quarters of contraction. * As the economy moderates towards trend growth in the year ahead, certain sectors, such as construction, retail and food services, aviation and hospitality, are expected to see a recovery. The manufacturing sector will likely remain as a pillar of growth for the economy. * As at writing, 92% of the population has completed the full vaccination regime, while 71% have received a booster shot. This will safeguard the nation against the Covid variants. * In February 2022, MTI maintained the country's GDP growth forecast for 2022 at 4.0% to 6.0%. Significant safe management measures were relaxed in March, while a new Vaccinated Travel Framework came into place in April. The Omicron wave has likely peaked, and we expect stronger business and consumer confidence in the months ahead. The easing of borders should help alleviate the manpower crunch to some extent. Risks are skewed to the downside, given the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, inflation pressures and upward pressure on interest rates.

The transaction is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. * The collective sale of Tanglin Shopping Centre, which has office and retail components, was awarded to Pacific Eagle Real Estate for S$868mn. * Frasers Logistics and Commercial Trust (FLCT) divested Cross Street Exchange, a mixed-use commercial property, to an undisclosed third party for S$810.8mn. * RESIDENTIAL: The higher additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) rates are likely to trim developers' interest in large residential sites, since the risk of not selling all units is higher, and the associated penalties are now more punitive. * COMMERCIAL: The fresh easing of social, workplace, event and border restrictions will instill investors' stronger confidence in the commercial market. In addition, developers' interest is likely to spill over to non-residential investments like the commercial sector. With the popularity of mixed-use developments, commercial-zoned sites are garnering more attention from investors since the residential components of such sites are not subjected to ABSD or Qualifying Certificate (QC) rules. Despite URA's recent imposition of restrictions on strata subdivision to the commercial component in properties located in certain designated areas including CBD and Orchard Road corridors, any drastic impact on market sentiments is not expected as the profile of the investors of commercial developments in recent times remain mainly institutional with a mid- to long-term investment horizon. * RETAIL: While suburban retail assets are expected to continue to be sought after, the interest in prime assets, especially strata-titled properties and units, may be renewed due to its scarcity, which may in turn spur higher transaction activity. * OFFICE: While technology demand growth could slow temporarily in the months ahead, on the back of supply chain constraints/disruptions and the Chinese regulatory clampdown, we remain optimistic on the finance sector, especially the wealth management industry, as a key driver of office demand. With the increase of up to 75% of the workforce allowed back to the office and improving business sentiment on the back of a strong rebound in Singapore's economic growth last year, companies may reassess their office space needs. * INDUSTRIAL: Amid heightened geopolitical tensions and supply chain risks, stockpiling requirements are likely to increase. The investment demand for logistics facilities and warehouses is expected to remain strong in tandem with the e-commerce growth trend. However, investors may adopt a cautious approach toward rapid expansion amid the expected softening of global growth for 2022. 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH OFFICE - Riding on the back-to-office momentum 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2021 2022 2023 2024 Under Construction mn sq KEY HIGHLIGHTS Average monthly gross rents (SGD/sq ft) SUPPLY - SINGAPORE OFFICE SUPPLY (sq ft) OFFICE SUPPLY PIPELINE (2022-2025) (sq ft) As at Q4 2021, nearly 4.9mn sq ft of new office space will be completed from 2022 to 2025, an increase from 3.9mn sq ft as of Q3 2021.

The leasing demand for prime office spaces in the central area moderated as corporates held back on their real estate needs amid the new Omicron wave during the quarter. Nonetheless, robust demand for premium spaces in Raffles Place and Grade A office spaces in Shenton Way/Robinson Road/ Tanjong Pagar brought about higher occupancies, while other segments saw some softening. The overall occupancy rate for office spaces in the CBD rose by 0.7 percentage points to 93.6% in Q1 2022, which was a similar rate of increase compared to the previous quarter. * The limited supply of quality spaces continued to support rental growth across all subzones of the office sector in Q1 2022, albeit to various extents. In the CBD, premium rents at Marina Bay and Grade A rents at Raffles Place experienced the strongest uptick. Grade B rents at Shenton Way/Robinson Road/ Tanjong Pagar have also risen for the first time by 0.6% since Q1 2020. In non-CBD, rents across different subzones improved by 0.2%-0.5% qoq, while office rents in the decentralised rose by a modest 0.1%-0.2% qoq in Q1 2022. * Some of the major leasing deals in Q1 2022 included KPMG taking up around 100,000 sq ft in Asia Square Tower 2 and Sony Music's flagship regional headquarters at Duo Tower. The upcoming Guoco Midtown had also secured more tenants in the quarter. * Following URA's recent imposition of restrictions on strata subdivision to the commercial component in properties located in certain designated areas, including CBD and Orchard Road corridors, rents and prices of strata units are expected to rise due to scarcity in future supply. * While the growth in demand for the technology sector could slow temporarily in the months ahead due to the supply chain constraints/disruptions and the Chinese regulatory clampdown, we remain optimistic on the finance sector, especially the wealth management industry, as a key driver of office demand. * With up to 75% of workforce allowed back to the office and improved business sentiment driven by the strong rebound in Singapore's economic growth last year, companies are reassessing their office space needs. To accommodate future growth plans, adopt the hybrid working models, and address the employees' evolving requirements, companies might be looking for expansion in the current buildings or new spaces. * Barring the emergence of new Covid-19 variants, we expect the restrictions in the workplace may ease further by the end of the year, which may allow all employees to return to the office. Amid a tight supply pipeline, office demand will continue to strengthen, especially for good quality and sustainable spaces. 8 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL - Focus on decarbonisation and supply chain diversification 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 First-storey multiple-user factory Upper-storey multiple-user factory Hi-tech industrial space Business park (Central Region) $ psf 70 80 90 100 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Single-user factory Multiple-user factory Business park Warehouse % KEY HIGHLIGHTS RENTAL OF FIRST STOREY MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY OCCUPANCY RATE OF MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY F i r m p r o s p e c t s f o r t h e manufacturing sector drove the slight 0.6% qoq increase in rent.

The overall manufacturing sector has now recorded the 21st month of expansion, despite global growth's expected softening in 2022 amid heightened geopolitical tensions and supply chain risks. * On a 3-month moving average yoy basis, NODX grew by 15.3% yoy in February 2022, following a 19.9% rise in January 2022. Both the electronics and non- electronics sectors contracted. * Overall industrial net absorption decreased from 2.4mn sq ft in Q3 2021 to 0.2mn sq ft in Q4 2021, amid continued uncertainties surrounding global trade markets and looming inflation costs. The drivers were warehouse segment (0.4mn sq ft) and multiple-user factory segment (0.3mn sq ft). * Island-wide, occupancy rate for multiple-user factory increased 0.4% qoq to 90.2% in Q4 2021, whilst that of business park increased 0.2% qoq to 84.5% in Q4 2021. The rest of the occupancy rates for other industrial segments decreased by similar rates of 0.1% qoq in Q4 2021. * As of Q4 2021, approximately 59% of the supply pipeline will be completed in 2022, followed by 18% in 2023. Single-user factories accounted for the bulk (42%) of the supply pipeline with approximately 17.6mn sq ft NLA. Multiple-user factory space made up 31% of the supply pipeline, projected to be about 12.8mn sq ft NLA. * Amid robust manufacturing activity in Q1 2022, multiple-user factory rents rose by 0.3-0.6% qoq in the quarter. Buoyant demand for spaces with modern specifications pushed up rents by 0.6% qoq for hi-tech spaces in Q1 2022. * Stockpiling requirements are likely to increase amid heightened geopolitical tensions and supply chain risks, which will further increase the demand for logistics and warehouse facilities. It will also drive the push towards supply chain diversification to mitigate cost pressures and operating risks. * To achieve Singapore's new net-zero emission ambition by or around mid-century, it was announced during Budget 2022 that the carbon tax will be raised to S$25 per tonne in 2024 and 2025, and S$45 per tonne in 2026 and 2027 to reach S$50 to S$80 per tonne by 2030. More occupiers may be encouraged to change their business models toward decarbonisation and cost savings, while we expect to see more redevelopments of ageing assets into future-proof properties with higher specifications and sustainability features. * Amid flight to quality, prime logistics assets, high-tech factories and city-fringe business parks will continue to be sought-after, with rents and capital values expected to rise in tandem. * Despite the anticipated new supply of data centres coming onstream in response to the expected lifting of the data centre moratorium in Q2 2022, we expect continued rental growth due to tight supply in the near term amid strong demand. 10 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Development Location Developer NLA '000 sq ft Total Status 2021 A&A to existing Shaw Plaza Balestier Road Shaw Properties (1997) Pte Ltd 64 200 Under Construction A&A to Grantral Mall @ Macpherson Macpherson Road Wujie Times Square Pte Ltd 63 Boulevard 88 Cuscaden Road/ Orchard Boulevard Hong Leong Holdings, CDL and Lea Investments 30 Guoco Midtown Beach Rd Guoco Midtown Pte Ltd/ Midtown Bay Pte Ltd 23 Hotel/retail development Club Street Worldwide Hotels Group 20 2023 The Woodleigh Mall Upper Aljunied Road SPH and Kajima Development 150 455 Under construction Sengkang Grand Mall Compassvale Bow/ Sengkang Central CapitaLand and City Developments Limited 109 One Holland Village Holland Road Far East Organization, Sinoland, and Sekisui House 81 A&A to Changi Airport Terminal 2 Airport Boulevard Changi Airport Group (S) Pte Ltd 62 Dairy Farm Residences Dairy Farm Road United Engineers 30 Parc Komo/Komo Shoppes Upper Changi Road North/Jalan Mariam CEL Real Estate Development Pte Ltd 23 2024 Office/retail development Labrador Villa Road/ Pasir Panjang Road SP Group 26 26 PP: Sep-20 2025 Punggol Digital District Punggol Way JTC Corporation 173 173 WP: Oct-19 Total 854 SUPPLY OF RETAIL SPACES (2022-2025) (sq ft) The majority of the upcoming pipeline is the redevelopment of existing malls and ancillary retail, mainly from mixed-use office buildings and the retail podium from residential developments. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 2022 2023 2024 2025 Orchard/ Scotts Road Other City Areas Fringe/Suburban Areas '000 sq ft Source: URA, EDMUND TIE RETAIL - Brighter prospects with fresh easing of COVID measures KEY HIGHLIGHTS AVERAGE RETAIL RENTAL (SGD/sq ft) RETAIL OCCUPANCY RATES The average occupancy rate of retail spaces in Singapore remained unchanged in Q4 2021.

The overall occupancy rate remained constant at 91.9% in Q4 2021. * The occupancy rate for the Fringe/Suburban Area improved by 0.1% points to 93.9% in Q4 2021, the sixth quarter of consecutive increase since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. * In Q1 2022, rents for Fringe/Suburban continued to outperform and rose by 1.3% qoq, compared to a slower growth of 0.5% qoq in Orchard/Scotts Road and marginal growth in rental rates of 0.3% in Other City Areas. * Retail openings in Q1 2022 included Japanese furniture brand Nitori Retail's first Singapore store at Courts Nojima at The Hereen, Uniqlo at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, and Pepper Lunch GO! at 313@Somerset. Retail closures included Dunkin' Donuts temporarily closing all their outlets in Singapore, Isetan at Parkway Parade, and Marks & Spencer at 313@Somerset. * The 3-month moving average of yoy change in retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) has risen from 6.8% in October 2021 to 9.6% in January 2022. Retail sales for Petrol Service Stations, Wearing Apparel & Footwear and Watches & Jewellery experienced the greatest improvement yoy in Q4 2021. The majority of the retail trade categories experienced a positive growth except for Mini-marts & Convenience Stores, Others and Optical Goods & Books, which were the only three categories that experienced losses. * For the food and beverage services index for Q4 2021, Restaurants was the sole component that reported a decline of 5.3% yoy due to the dining restrictions. Food Caterers recorded the greatest improvement, increasing by 42.2% yoy in Q4 2021 followed by Cafes, Food Courts & Other Eating Places which rose by 4.2% yoy. * We expect the fresh easing of social, event and border restrictions to improve retail sentiment and boost consumer confidence, which will further improve retail sales. * In particular, the increased dining capacity to 10 fully vaccinated people is a welcome move for the F&B sector, though the current requirement for safe distancing of 1m between tables means that eating outlets are still not be able to operate at full capacity. * As a result of URA's recent imposition of restrictions on strata subdivision to the commercial component in properties located in certain designated areas, including CBD and Orchard Road corridors, demand and occupancy of prime retail assets may keep steady or even improve amid the limited supply of existing strata malls. * The latest strata policy change may also improve the tenant diversity of malls and allows for more effective control of the mall's positioning under single ownership, which may drive higher footfall and spending. As a result, malls in the designated areas may enjoy lower vacancy rates and command higher rents over time. * As Singapore further reopens its borders with the lifting of most restrictions for fully vaccinated visitors, the anticipated return of more tourists will inject greater optimism for the recovery of the retail sector, especially in the Central Area. 12 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Q1 2011 Q3 2011 Q1 2012 Q3 2012 Q1 2013 Q3 2013 Q1 2014 Q3 2014 Q1 2015 Q3 2015 Q1 2016 Q3 2016 Q1 2017 Q3 2017 Q1 2018 Q3 2018 Q1 2019 Q3 2019 Q1 2020 Q3 2020 Q1 2021 Q3 2021 Residential pipeline Total unsold Years to clear unsold based on 3-year moving average for new sales per annum (RHS) Years '000 units 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 201120122013201420152016201720182019202020212022 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Units RESIDENTIAL - Price growth to soften in the wake of cooling measures 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 Q1 2011 Q1 2012 Q1 2013 Q1 2014 Q1 2015 Q1 2016 Q1 2017 Q1 2018 Q1 2019 Q1 2020 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 All Residential Price Index Landed Non-landed 1Q 2009 = 100 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 Q1 2011 Q1 2012 Q1 2013 Q1 2014 Q1 2015 Q1 2016 Q1 2017 Q1 2018 Q1 2019 Q1 2020 Q1 2021 Primary sales Secondary sales Residential launches* Units KEY HIGHLIGHTS PROPERTY PRICE INDEX OF ALL PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES RESIDENTIAL PIPELINE SUPPLY PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SALES TRANSACTION VOLUME PRIVATE HOME RENTAL TRANSACTIONS In Q1 2022, based on URA's flash estimate, the overall Property Price Index (PPI) for private residential proper ties rose for the eight consecutive quarter by 0.4% qoq, a moderation from Q4 2021's 5.0%. Landed property prices rose by 4.0% qoq while non-landed property prices corrected by 0.6% qoq. The pipeline supply for private homes rose by 2.8% qoq in Q4 2021. The total number of unsold units rose slightly by 0.3% qoq and we expect the units to be absorbed in 2.0 years. Based on caveats lodged between 1 Jan 2022 and 31 Mar 2022, overall sales transaction volumes for private residential units decreased by 42% qoq in Q1 2022 in the wake of the cooling measures. The transaction volumes for both the primary and secondary markets declined qoq, by 43% and 42% respectively. The number of private rental transactions grew significantly by 6.6% to a record high in 2021, driven by completion delays within the construction sector, which created demand for rental units. Rental transactions fell by 11.9% qoq in Q4 2021 and by 39% qoq in Q1 2022. Q1 2021 14,619 units Q4 2021 23,915 units Q1 2022 (URA flash estimate) 174.3 Q4 2021 173.6 Q1 2022 4,568 units Q4 2021 7,925 units Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA Source: URA * Residential launch data for Q1 2022 is based on new launches in Jan 2022 and Feb 2022 only. Q4 2021 53,555 units, 21,612 total unsold Q3 2021 52,101 units, 21,551 total unsold 13 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH MARKET COMMENTARY MARKET OUTLOOK * According to URA's flash estimate for Q1 2022, the Property Price Index (PPI) for private residential properties rose for the eighth consecutive quarter by 0.4% qoq, marking a noticeably slower growth in the wake of the cooling measures. Prices for the landed properties rose by 4.0%, while the non-landed prices fell by 0.6%. Besides the impact of the cooling measures, the softer non-landed prices were also a result of the dearth of new launches during the quarter. There were two new projects launched in Q1 2022, Royal Hallmark in the RCR and Ikigai in the CCR. * Based on caveats lodged, new sales and secondary transaction volumes dipped 44% and 49% qoq respectively in Q1 2022. Within both the new sales and secondary sales market, the decline in activity was broad-based and similar across the market segments. * The price movements across the market segments reflect the expected immediate impact of the cooling measures on investment demand. The CCR, which has the highest foreign share of demand, fell by 0.5% qoq. On the other hand, the suburban OCR segment continued to see prices rising by 1.9% qoq, albeit at a slower pace compared with 5.7% a quarter ago. Our price analysis showed that median prices were more resilient in the secondary market, rising by 0.4% qoq in Q1 2022, while median prices in the primary market declined by 1.7% qoq. * The pipeline supply for private residential homes rose by 2.8% qoq as of Q4 2021. The total number of unsold units rose slightly by 0.3% qoq to 21,612 units and we expect the unsold units to be absorbed in 2 years, based on the average sales pace over the last three years. The tight supply situation will continue to lend pricing power to developers. * Private rental transactions grew significantly by 6.6% to a record high in 2021, driven by the continual ongoing uncertainties within the construction sector, which created the demand for rental units. Rental transactions fell by 11.9% qoq in Q4 2021 and 39% qoq in Q1 2022. The marked decline in Q1 2022 was broad-based across the three market segments and is likely due to the low vacancies in the market. Some expatriates may have taken the opportunity to return to their home countries, expecting to return with ease as the border restrictions are relaxed. * We expect price growth to moderate with the imposition of the latest cooling measures to promote housing affordability and curb market exuberance. However, we do not expect strong pressures on developers to reduce prices, especially for projects with limited unsold inventory. * Looking ahead, the tightening of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) could divert some demand towards suburban homes, which are more affordable. We also expect some rotation of demand from RCR to OCR in 2022, given the strong price increases in RCR in 2021. * Demand will continue to be largely supported by local first-time home buyers and HDB upgraders, who are least impacted by the cooling measures. Stable economic prospects and an improving job market in 2022 will further support the demand for private homes. * However, we expect sales momentum to slow, on the back of fewer units from new launches in 2022. Developers will likely exercise more caution in bidding for land parcels over the next few months. We expect a recovery in launch and sales activity in H2 2022, if the collective sales market stabilises. * While the cooling measures will dampen sales momentum, the overall market remains supported by a robust labour market, ongoing economic growth, and healthy demand-supply dynamics in the property market. The nation is also better prepared to face new Covid challenges, given the high vaccination rates and booster programme. Our base projection is a slight correction of the primary sales to about 11,000 - 12,000 units for 2022. * With the VTL and resumption of air travel bringing more expatriates, foreign workers, and students back to Singapore, we foresee rental demand to strengthen in 2022. However, as the shortage of manpower in the construction sector is gradually resolved, demand for short-term rentals could decline. The completion of new projects could slow the rate of rental increases. Editor: Authors: Lam Chern Woon Senior Direct"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Despite a net weighted balance of 8% of manufacturers foreseeing a favourable business outlook in H1 2022, supported by the encouraging pace of growth in 2021, the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war since February this year might further aggravate already-con- strained global supply chains. The disrupted supply of rare metals and neon from the warring nations that many semiconductor manufacturers rely on to produce chips are rapidly being exhausted in existing inventories. The ripple effect of the conflict could draw out the global chip shortage longer than expected, affecting growth. In addition, COVID-19 lockdowns in China as well as rising inflation have been some of the other critical factors dampening manufacturers' sentiments. In March 2022, the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered a slower rate of expansion at 50.1, representing declines of 0.7 points y-o-y and 0.1 point m-o-m. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in January and February 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against October and November 2021) and y-o-y (against January and February 2021). Land in excess of 100,000 sf remains high in demand, stemming from end-users in need of larger parcels and buildings for expansion. Notwithstanding this, the current supply of good quality industrial buildings is limited, resulting in the tapering of total sales to S$431.2 million in the first three months of the year (Exhibit 1). In January and February 2022, leasing activity in the industrial market generally picked up 4.9% on a y-o-y basis. Strata industrial space remained particularly popular among businesses due to the more palatable floor areas and price quantums. While demand for such space remains healthy, the pace of leasing movements slowed. The multiple-user factory segment registered 1,557 tenancies in the first two months of the year, representing a marginal decline of 0.4% y-o-y, although the reduction was in part due to the high-base last year when the total number of leases hit new heights of 1,564 (January and February 2021), not seen since 2012 (Exhibit 2).

Earlier in October 2021, twinned bases - Batamindo Industrial Park (BIP) and Bintan Industrial Estate (BIE) - were established between Singapore and Indonesia. And more recently in February 2022, another initiative was introduced in Singapore and Vietnam known as the Sembcorp Development's Vietnam Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs). These will help manufacturers who are looking to grow their businesses and adapt strategies that could potentially increase their output production more efficiently and effectively. With external forces exacerbating the global semiconductor supply crunch, manufacturers may turn cautious when considering expansion activities. However, as e-commerce has proven sustainable, especially in this day and age where economies are steadily progressing towards being digital, the demand for logistics and warehouse space is expected to remain stable. Between 2022 and 2026, some 50.8 million sf of new industrial GFA will be coming on stream to the sector. Of the 29.9 million sf set to be completed sometime this year, single-user factory is projected to account for the lion's share of the upcoming supply, with approximately 13.1 million sf of new space (43.8%). Notwithstanding the upcoming supply in 2022, healthy demand and measured expansion in the industrial market continue to be underpinned by encouraging levels of direct investment from the biomedical, biotechnology and electronics sectors. As such, industrial price and rents are on track to improve in a moderate manner by 3% to 5% for the whole of 2022.

GDP increased by 3.7% y-o-y thus far in the first three months of 2022, supported by the 7.1% y-o-y growth of the manufacturing sector. This was primarily led by strong output expansions within the electronics and precision engineering clusters in Q1 as global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment remained robust. Nonetheless, business sentiments have moderated. According to Singstat's Business Expectations report for the manufacturing sector, overall, a net weighted balance of +2% of manufacturing firms foresee a favourable business outlook for the period April to September 2022, lower than the preceding net weighted balance of +8% recorded in the previous quarter. As such, despite dampened business sentiments due to prolonged global uncertainties, the electronics industry continues to grow, boosting performance in the overall manufacturing sector as the Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) posted an expansion of 50.3 in June 2022. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in April and May 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against January and February 2022) and y-o-y (against April and May 2021). Overall, the pace of industrial sales has slowed down. In Q2 2022, total transactions amounted to S$661.5 million, representing declines of 4.9% and 30.2% on a q-o-q and y-o-y basis respectively. Multiple-user factory spaces, posing as one of the more affordable industrial assets, continued to register healthy levels of sales, bringing the average price to S$439 psf (Exhibit 1). One of the main contributors to the demand for industrial space is the food industry, where occupiers are actively on the lookout for food factories and central kitchens in Singapore. With rising global concerns on food security, as well as access to raw materials and necessities, stockpiling activity has increased. The strengthening Singapore dollar provided support for stockpiling, mitigating escalation in costs as inflation becomes significant. The need for space to support the increase in firms' inventories expanded demand for warehouse space, evident from the 212 rental transactions recorded for such space in just April 2022 alone (Exhibit 2). Historically, this leasing volume stands as the highest number of tenancies on a monthly basis since data became available, bringing the cumulative median rental for warehouse to S$1.85 psf pm in April and May.

In April 2022, the redevelopment of Pokka's regional headquarters commenced. To be completed by Q1 2024, the new state-of-the-art building will house an innovation and incubation hub with sustainable features and facilities. More recently in May 2022, Singapore's first eco-friendly manufacturing hub, Green Lab, spanning some 200,000 sf officially opened. Envisioned to be a one-stop production plant, the facility will manufacture some of Singapore's first fully compostable plant-based bags that could potentially replace existing plastic ones. Fraser and Neave (F&N), who owns a 60% stake in Green Lab through its publishing arm, Times Publishing, will be switching the packaging of its in-house brands and products to the sustainable alternatives produced. Despite existing global and regional uncertainties, bright spots continue to highlight the industrial market. The persisting chip shortage globally will continue to generate demand for electronics, and the transport engineer- ing cluster will benefit from the increased demand for air travel as travel accelerates in many parts of the world. Thus, prices and rentals for industrial space remain on track to grow 3% to 5% for the whole of 2022. In tandem with these initiatives, JTC has also introduced solar deployment models, helping industries to transition towards sustainable and renewable energy sources through the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. To facilitate solar energy adoption, solar deployment will be mandatory for certain sites that meet the requirements set by the government agency.

While the services-producing industries grew by 4.2% YoY in Q1, overall economic growth was led by the 6.3% YoY recovery in the goods-producing industries. Alongside a robust expansion of 2.1% YoY for the construction sector, manufacturing grew signifi cantly by 7.1% YoY. The manufacturing sector has ended the fi rst quarter with growth moderation, with the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipping from 50.7 in December to 50.1 in March. The Russia-Ukraine confl ict created a fallout with rising energy costs, supply chain disruptions and infl ationary pressures on many fronts, clouding market sentiments and business planning. The growth in Singapore's key exports also slowed down, with non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rising 7.7% YoY in March, compared to 18.4% in December. RENTAL MARKET The quarterly leasing volume1 continued to increase, rising to 3,054 transactions in Q1/2022. However, the pace of growth slowed to 3.5% YoY. While single-user factory segment remained the key demand driver of the industrial rental market, the YoY growth in tenancies signed moderated from 63.0% in Q4/2021 to 39.7% in Q1/2022. The multiple- user factory and warehouse segments continued to see steady take-up from digital and creative fi rms, as well as ecommerce and third-party logistics (3PL) companies. As most small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generally prefer prime locations, the vacancy rate for multiple-user factory spaces in the Central Region fell to its lowest level (9.0%) of the last nine years. Despite the increase in overall occupier demand (+724,000 sq ft) in Q1/2022, the island-wide vacancy for multiple-user factory spaces of 11.2% has not been higher since Q4/2020. This was largely due to the addition of new supply from the partial completion of JTC Defu Industrial City. Meanwhile, the vacancy rate for single-user factories and warehouses remained relatively fi rm in Q1/2022, inching up to 9.6% (+0.2% ppt QoQ) and 9.7% (+0.3 ppt QoQ) respectively. Compared with the previous quarter, rents continued to increase across all industrial segments in Q1/2022. The JTC's rental index for factory hit a post-2017 record and the Savills' average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 increased by 3.6% QoQ to S$1.90 per sq ft in Q1/2022. Although 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. the JTC's rental index for warehouses rose, the Savills' average monthly rent for prime warehouses and logistics properties3 recorded a marginal decline of 0.7% QoQ to S$1.45 per sq ft in Q1/2022. While landlords of modern warehouse facilities are still holding up their rental expectations, the overall rental decline was largely due to the decrease in rents in some of the strata-titled warehouse properties in our basket. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 fell 8% from 460 transactions in Q1/2021 to 423 transactions in Q1/2022. Notwithstanding the decline in sales, this is still well above the historical fi ve-year average sales (279 caveats). The steady sales momentum was likely backed by local SMEs which acquired multiple-user factory and warehouse properties for their own business operations, especially those in the electronics, manufacturing, biomedical, healthcare, ecommerce, and last mile transportation services. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for freehold properties increased by 1.1% QoQ to S$729 per sq ft while that of 60-year leasehold units rose by 0.9% QoQ to S$447 per sq ft in Q1/2022. From Savills' basket of industrial properties, 30- year leasehold industrial properties increased by a faster pace at 3.5% QoQ to S$305 per sq ft in Q4, ending six consecutive years of year-on-year price declines. The overall price growth could be backed by ample liquidity in the market. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL The island-wide vacancy level for business park space fell by 1.1 ppt QoQ to 14.4% in Q1/2022, the lowest since Q4/2020. Owing to the healthy take-up rate of prime business park developments such as Mapletree Business City and one-north, the vacancy rate in the Central Planning Region eased further by 2.3 ppts QoQ to a record low at 6.2% in Q1/2022. Coupled with the scarcity and steady demand in Mapletree Business City and one-north regions, Savills' prime business park5 monthly rents rose by 0.6% QoQ to S$5.89 per sq ft. While the vacancy rate in the West Planning Region fell by 1.8 ppt QoQ to 28.1% in Q1/2022, that in the East Planning Region continued to worsen to 24.2% (+2.3 ppts QoQ) due to softer demand from ESR Bizpark @ Chai Chee and Changi Business Park.

Hence, Savills' standard business park properties6 monthly rents slipped by 0.1% QoQ to S$4.00 per sq ft in Q1/2022. What was interesting was that some fi rms upgraded from fl atted factories to more prime and accessible high-spec industrial developments and yet managed to achieve rental savings by rightsizing and consolidating operations from various locations. Particularly, new high- spec industrial projects such as UBIX and other well-located developments continue to experience good take-up rates. These market movements could have helped generate rental growth, resulting in an increase of 1.4% QoQ in the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket7 to S$3.61 per sq ft in Q1/2022. OUTLOOK In the face of more economic challenges such as high infl ation and the worldwide energy crunch, the Russia-Ukraine confl ict has clouded the early-2022 optimistic outlook for Singapore's post- COVID recovery. While the immediate impact on the local economy has been manageable, the longer-term impact of the confl ict on Singapore's economy will depend on how the situation unfolds. Notwithstanding the global headwinds, industrial and logistics emerged as one of the most 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. multiple-user factory rents are expected to see some recovery this year, warehouse and logistics real estate is expected to better weather the increased downside risks and negative feedback eff ects arising from the Russia-Ukraine crisis. As such, rents for prime warehouse properties is forecast to grow by up to 5% this year, with the demand for modern warehouse facilities coming from new economy industries likely to stay fi rm. Taking the abovementioned factors into account, rent for prime multiple-user factory and warehouse & logistics properties is forecast to grow by up to 2% and 5% respectively in 2022.

In particular, demand for modern warehouse facilities and high-specifi cation industrial facilities is likely to sustain. Some of the upcoming modern warehouse developments saw healthy pre-commitment levels. For instance, 2 Pioneer Sector 1 (2PS1) is already more than 70% pre-committed from tenants in the Fast- Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), e-commerce and third-party logistics (3PL) industries. As the supply of modern warehouse facilities with quality specifi cations is expected to remain limited in the near term due to construction delays, demand for such high-specifi cation facilities is expected to hold up overall rental growth. Nonetheless, industrialists may generally be more cautious with their expansion plans alongside the global semiconductor supply crunch and heightened uncertainty. Considering rising labour costs and elevated commodity prices, higher business costs could curtail manufacturing activity and any expansion of footprint. While Industrial"}], "max_tokens": 10}}
