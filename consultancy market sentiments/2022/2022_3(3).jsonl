The strong growth for multiple-user factory rents could be attributed to the growing demand for high-specification multi-user factories, as occupiers look for office grade industrial spaces near the city fringe. Demand for factories have also been supported by continued growth in the biomedical, and high value manufacturing industries as more firms are encouraged to set up their manufacturing hubs in Singapore due to its political neutrality, efficient infrastructure, and government support. 2 All Industrial Property The drop in overall occupancy of 0.3% this quarter was driven mainly by a fall in occupancy of single-user factories. There were also slight declines in the occupancy rates of the multi-user factory and warehouse segments, but this can be attributed to more supply coming onstream and catching up with demand after construction delays during Covid. Warehouse Although warehouse rents increased by 1.9% q- o-q overall, the rate of rental growth has moderated due to supply catching up with demand. Rental performance would vary across different warehouses, depending on their location and specifications. Specifically, there has been strong demand for investor grade ramp-up warehouses, as the delivery of new supply is not keeping pace with demand. However, leasing demand for warehouse space may taper in the coming quarters with a weaker manufacturing outlook, and as consumer demand shifts to services from goods post-Covid, leading to lower requirements for manufacturers to stockpile. Business Parks Business park rents have started to exhibit some sustained growth, on the back of tight supply in the city fringe areas. Most tenants prefer the newer, higher specification developments in the city fringe. On the other hand, leasing activity for space in the rest of island business parks has been slow. In addition, high vacancy rates and a higher supply pipeline could continue to suppress rents.

The warehouse segment might be an exception to this trend, as there appears to be a dearth of supply post 2024, and the pre- commitment to existing pipeline supply is high. Going forward, rental increases across all sectors are set to continue with an increase in service charges, as asset owners have to pass on higher operating costs to tenants. This increase in service charges could range from around 5% in warehouse and factories to 10% in business parks. On a macro level, economic indicators are collectively pointing to a manufacturing slowdown and weaker sentiment. This was largely driven by a slowdown in electronics shipments, with rising inflation and recession concerns weighing on consumer demand. Nevertheless, demand for industrial space, especially high specification warehouses and city fringe business parks, will still be underpinned by growth industries such as the food, logistics, precision engineering and biomedical sectors, which in turn will support rental and price growth, albeit at a more measured pace. 6.9 16.8 14.3 4.2 4.5 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 16.0 18.0 Q4 2022F 2023F 2024F 2025F 2026F Estimated GFA (mil sf) Warehouse Business Park Single-user Factory Multi-user Factory About Colliers Colliers (NASDAQ, TSX: CIGI) is a leading diversified professional services and investment management company.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Growth Forecast Narrowed Singapore's economy grew by 4.4% y-o-y during Q2 2022, taking the first-half growth to 4.1%. The overall manufacturing sector has recorded 26 consecutive months of expansion as of August with its purchasing managers' index (PMI) being at 50 and above. However, PMI dipped 0.1 point from July to 50.0 in August, indicating relatively weaker manufacturing sentiments. On the back of weakened global economic environment weighed down by more aggressive tightening monetary policy to tackle inflationary pressure and taking into consideration Singapore's economic performance during H1 2022, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has narrowed its economic growth forecast range this year to 3%-4%, from an earlier projection of 3%-5%. Continued Rental Growth Across Most Segments Rental increases were observed for all industrial asset classes during Q3 2022 as vacancy rates remained relatively tight. Notably, vacancy rates vary across different segments. Vacancy rate of prime logistics went down to below 3.0% and city-fringe business park vacancy rate was tightened further to 3.1% while vacancy rate of outlying business parks stayed elevated at almost 25.0%. Nonetheless, rents of business parks in outlying areas inched up marginally during the quarter, increasing by 0.1% q-o-q, as some landlords have raised their asking rents to keep pace with rising inflation, especially for buildings that has recently undergone Asset Enhancement Initiative. City-fringe business park and Science Park rents also increased in tandem with broader market trend, growing by 0.2% and 1.1% q-o-q, respectively. Warehouses and prime logistics rents continued to rise in Q3 2022 given further tightening of vacancy rates. The rates of rental growth in warehouse and prime logistics segments have moderated as more new supply comes onstream amid a temporary slowdown in demand and expansion due to rising macro-economic challenges. Nonetheless, stockpiling demand for food and raw materials would continue to support occupancy levels for prime logistics / warehouse spaces. Despite substantial completed supply, factory space continued to witness rental growth of 0.7% q-o-q in Q3 2022 on the back of healthy manufacturing performance, especially for the precision engineering (+4.9% y-o-y in Q2 2022) and the general manufacturing (+11.0% y-o-y in Q2 2022) clusters. Similarly, high-tech rents also inched up by 0.7% q-o-q as leasing demand was underpinned by high-value manufacturing and tech sectors as well as spillover demand from CBD office market where rents continued to experience robust growth. Healthy Investment Interests Despite Headwinds The industrial investment market saw some activities as investors look for assets with a comfortable yield spread amid a rising interest rate environment. Industrial assets typically offer higher yields as compared to other asset classes due to their shorter leases and lower investors' familiarity coupled with JTC's regulations. Notably, Ascendas REIT was reported to acquire Philips Asean Pacific (APAC) Centre for S$104.8 million and 1 Buroh Lane for S$191.9 million at estimated yields of 7.2% and 7.0%, respectively during Q3 2022.

The rate of manufacturing growth of 5.7% y-o-y in Q2 was a contraction from the y-o-y increases of above 7% each quarter throughout 2021. Despite sentiment turning tentative, manufacturing clusters such as transport engineering, general manufacturing, electronics and precision engineering continued to be the main contributors to growth and output increases in Q2. In addition, the construction industry has ramped up activity after COVID-19 delays, growing by 3.3% y-o-y in Q2 from the 2.4% increase in the previous quarter. This in turn led to knock-on stimulus for manufacturers supporting the construction sector. After driving much of the economic growth through the pandemic years, prevailing global geopolitical and economic challenges have tempered business sentiments in the industrial sector. The Business Expectations report published by Singstat reported that a net weighted balance of 8% of manufacturing firms anticipate a less favourable business outlook from July to December 2022 compared to the 2% that expected a favourable business situation for the period April to September 2022. 1 The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in July and August 2022 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against April and May 2022) and y-o-y (against July and August 2021). Knight Frank Research Reports are available at knightfrank.com.sg/research Additionally, in the month of September, the overall Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) posted a contraction of 49.9, after 26 consecutive months of expansion with a corresponding contraction of 49.4 in the Electronics Sector. Singapore's appeal as a strategic and trusted node for business Nevertheless, despite the moderation in overall industrial performance, Singapore remains a compelling destination for regional headquarters as well as a location for high-value manufacturing activities. Many foreign companies diverted their attention towards the city-state as a location of security amid global uncertainty, leveraging on the competitive edge that the financial hub offers as well as the transparency and stability of its legal and regulatory framework. In Q2 2022, fixed asset investment (FAI) commitments in Singapore totalled S$6.3 billion, the highest on a quarterly basis since Q1 2020 when S$10.3 billion was secured. Manufacturing accounted for S$3.6 billion, which included S$2.9 billion of investments in the electronics sector. Examples of notable foreign businesses setting up base in Singapore recently include SOCOMEC, a leading global specialist in power management solutions, which will be opening its new Asia Pacific headquarters at the Meiban Industrial Building along Ubi Road.

Easing demand for factory space Industrial sales totalled S$773.1 million in the third quarter, easing by 12.2% q-o-q and 5.0% y-o-y. Despite this, overall prices continued to trend upwards with an average price of S$444 psf, an increase of 2.4% compared to the previous quarter, together with increased FAI (Exhibit 1). Based on transactions, the Geylang and Woodlands Planning Areas were sought-after locations with 49 (S$72.5 million) and 47 (S$42.5 million) factory units transacted in the quarter, the majority being multiple-user factories. While the overall demand for industrial space declined, the improving construction and transport sectors driving output expansions in certain manufacturing clusters propped up sales activity in Q3. As such, the median rent for multiple-user factories was healthy at S$1.89 psf pm in July and August 2022 with 1,659 tenancies, compared to a median of S$1.76 psf pm in the same period a year ago (Exhibit 2). More businesses integrating and producing sustainable alternatives or products such as plant-based protein and bags could sustain leasing demand for multiple-user factory space that support these emerging business types. Market outlook The steady stream of investment commitments flowing into Singapore will continue to generate value and create more jobs as Singapore readjusts towards pre-pandemic normalcy. Coupled with the nation's standing as a safe business destination, these could potentially serve as a shelter against unforeseen external shocks and the looming economic uncertainty. Industrial prices and rentals will remain stable, supported by the steady demand for space, and is enroute to grow 3% to 5% for the whole of 2022.

It was led by a pickup in activity across services industries and this made up for the slowdown in the manufacturing sector. The overall factory activity in Singapore contracted for the fi rst time in two years in September. In the face of weakened manufacturing sentiment arising from a slowdown in the global economies and also persistent price pressures, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) ended its 26 straight months of expansion and slipped to 49.9 in September. Growth in Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) also decelerated in September, posting the slowest rate of 3.1% YoY since August last year. RENTAL MARKET Leasing volume1 continued to fall in Q3, albeit at a moderated pace at 6.3% YoY, bringing the total number of transactions to 3,209 tenancies. The decline was attributed to fewer tenancies signed across all property types. Leasing demand for factory spaces continued to weaken in Q3 with leasing transactions for single- and multiple-user factory segments falling by 21.2% and 5.7% YoY respectively. While leasing demand for warehouse logistics space remained strong in prime areas, those for warehouses saw a marginal decline of 0.6% YoY. The vacancy level for single-user factory rose by 0.5 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.2% in Q3. This is likely to be due to an injection of new supply (580,000 sq ft) and some relocation among industrialists, particularly the West and North Planning Areas. Despite some major completions including JTC Defu Industrial City, the vacancy level for multiple-user factory inched up by just 0.2 of a ppt QoQ to 10.8% as demand for logistics space was still strong. Compared to the 9.1% vacancy level recorded in Q2, that measure stayed relatively stable at 9.2% as the take-up in Central and North Planning Regions were healthy. The overall industrial rents continued to increase for eight consecutive quarters in Q3, with JTC's rental index for factory spaces rising at its fastest pace since 2016. For warehouse rents, the JTC's index rose again to its highest level in the last six years. Savills' average monthly rents also continued to increase in Q3, with rents for prime multiple-user factories2 rising by 0.4% QoQ to S$2.01 per sq ft. With the support from 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). 2 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user factory properties which ranges from 1,000 sq ft to 3,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.50 per sq ft. healthy leasing momentum and a shortage of quality facilities, Savills' average monthly rents for warehouse and logistics properties3 doubled the pace of increase to 2.8% QoQ and rose to S$1.51 per sq ft in Q3. SALES MARKET Following a short-lived uptick in Q2, strata industrial sales activity4 fell 15.7% QoQ across all segments to 452 transactions. This could be partly attributed to the growing recession fears and rising cost of borrowing which weighed on investors' sentiments. Strata warehouse sales fell marginally to 24 deals in Q3, compared with 34 in Q2. The sales volume for multiple-user factory declined from 497 in Q2 to 424 deals in Q3. However, the sales momentum for West Connect Building continued to hold up while other projects saw a muted sales take-up in Q3. Industrial sales prices continued trending up in Q3, even though the overall price increase of properties with longer tenures halved from the previous quarter. Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that prices for 60-year leasehold and freehold industrial properties rose by 1.2% QoQ to S$463 per sq ft and S$758 per sq ft respectively in Q3. Apart from the longer remaining tenure and nature of freehold leases, the rise in prices was driven by the strong price growth for food factory properties. On the other hand, Savills' basket of industrial properties showed that 30-year leasehold property prices increased at a quicker pace of 0.9% QoQ to S$308 per sq ft in Q3. It could be led by stronger interest among some businesses which prefer properties of a lower quantum, and therefore these are of shorter lease tenures, to mitigate their risks amid rising economic uncertainty and elevated market volatility. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL In Q3, business park is the only segment which saw a slight improvement in occupancy level. It is likely led by an increase in appetite for taking up business park space amid the tightening of offi ce supply. Although one- north and International Business Park (IBP) recorded higher vacancy level in Q3, the islandwide vacancy level for business park space eased by 0.1 of a ppt QoQ to 14.8% due to higher take-up in the Changi Business Park (CBP) and CleanTech Park locations. Nonetheless, vacancy level in areas such as Science Park, IBP and CBP remained under pressure due to locational factors that lead to weaker connectivity to main transport nodes. Moreover, business consulting fi rms, 3 Based on Savills basket of private multiple-user warehouse properties which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 80,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$1.30 per sq ft. 4 Based on JTC's sales caveat data, downloaded on 2 November 2022.

Coupled with the rise in service charges, rents are expected to continue on an upward trend as landlords pass on higher business costs to tenants. Notably, there is a dearth of supply of warehouse space after 2024 when no signifi cant new supply is expected to come on stream. This could put further upward pressure on warehouse rents. Prior to that, rents for prime warehouse and logistics properties are expected to rise by 5.0% YoY for each year in 2022 and 2023. Although rental growth for prime multiple-user factory spaces is forecast to moderate to 5% YoY in 2023, it is likely to see high growth for new food factories which are expected to complete next year.

This is despite the sector's moderate performance in recent quarters and a rocky global economy, said real estate consultancy Knight Frank in a report on Friday (Oct 7). Industrial sales, for instance, totalled at S$773.1 million in Q3 of 2022, down 12.2 per cent from the previous quarter, and 5 per cent from 2021. The number of industrial tenancies plunged to 2,237, down 28 per cent from the previous quarter and 36.1 per cent from last year. Knight Frank also noted an overall slowdown in the rate of manufacturing growth so far this year. It said: \"After driving much of the economic growth throughout the pandemic years, prevailing global geopolitical and economic challenges tempered business sentiment in the industrial sector.\" Despite observing that sentiment has turned \"tentative\", the team at Knight Frank predicts that industrial prices and rentals will stabilise and are on track to growing 3 to 5 per cent for the whole of 2022. It noted that overall prices of industrial properties continued to trend upward this quarter, with an average price of S$444 per square feet (psf), up 2.4 per cent from the previous quarter. Popular locations for these transactions - the majority of which were for multiple-user factories - include the Geylang Planning Area, with 49 transactions worth S$72.5 million, and Woodlands Planning Area, with 47 transactions worth S$42.5 million.

Request Blocked The median rent for multiple-user factories remained healthy at S$1.89 psf per month in July and August 2022, in Knight Frank's view, compared with S$1.76 psf per month in the previous year. \"While the overall demand for industrial space declined, the improving construction and transport sectors driving output expansions in certain manufacturing clusters propped up sales activity in Q3,\" said Knight Frank. \"More businesses integrating and producing sustainable alternatives or products such as plant-based proteins and bags could sustain leasing demand for multiple-user factory space that support these emerging business types.\" Knight Frank added that demand for industrial properties will hold steady - especially as foreign companies continue to pick Singapore, with its security and stability, as a choice location for their regional headquarters or for high-value manufacturing. For example, several international semiconductor companies - such as American semiconductor firm GlobalFoundries, German microchip maker Infineon and French water manufacturer Soitec - have announced substantial investments to expand their operations in Singapore, under plans to ramp up production capacity amid the global chip shortage. The most recent company to set up in the Republic was Pall Corporation, a filtration, separation and purification technology business that in August broke ground for a US$100 million manufacturing facility. \"The steady stream of investment commitments flowing into Singapore will continue to generate value and create more jobs,\" said the consultancy. \"Coupled with the nation's standing as a safe business destination, these could potentially serve as a shelter against unforeseen external shocks and the looming economic uncertainty.\" READ MORE Multi-faceted industrial market in Apac has diverse growth opportunities Industrial S-Reits report positive rental reversions Singapore industrial space rents, prices continue to rise in Q1; occupancy falls: JTC INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY KNIGHT FRANK SINGAPORE PROPERTY Already a subscriber?
