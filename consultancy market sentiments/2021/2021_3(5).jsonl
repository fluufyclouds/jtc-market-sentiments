Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Manufacturing to Steer the Recovery Course Despite Singapore's record full-year GDP contraction of 5.4% in 2020, the manufacturing sector grew by 7.3% yoy, driven by the outperformance of biomedical manufacturing, electronics and precision engineering clusters. The purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a barometer for the manufacturing economy, maintains its affirmative market indication of 50.5 points as of February 2021. Amidst thriving demand for semiconductor and digital processing solutions, manufacturing, along with information & communications and finance & insurance sectors, are poised to drive growth. According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Singapore's economy is expected to grow by 4% to 6% in 2021. Sectorial Performance Continue to Diverge But Rents Show Signs of Stability City-fringe business parks rents recorded a marginal growth of 0.2% qoq, reaching $5.90 psf/mth in Q1 2021, amidst tight supply and demand from technology and biomedical companies who favour high-spec and well-located developments. On the other hand, outlying business park rents ($3.59 psf/mth) fell by 1.3% qoq, driven by lower rents at business parks at the west. Science Park rents ($4.23 psf/mth) registered a fall of 0.9% qoq. High-tech and conventional factory (ground floor) rents remained stable in Q1 2021, at $3.12 and $1.78 psf/mth respectively. Additionally, conventional warehouses (ground floor) and prime logistics rents remained flat in Q1 2021, at $1.54 psf/mth and $1.39 psf/mth respectively. The prevalence of retail, food and healthcare e-commerce will continue to drive demand for logistics spaces, while the accelerated digital transformation has sustained demand for well-located business park and high-tech spaces. Growing demand will be sustained by occupiers across technology, life science and logistics industries have largely thrived since the pandemic. For example, the warehouse capacity of GKE Corp was reported to be full at present and the company is on the lookout for additional storage space. Shopee also cited that it will need to build up its fulfilment capability, in areas such as warehousing and distribution centres. As such, prime logistics, city-fringe business parks, Science Park and high-tech factory spaces are expected to register growth in 2021 amidst prevailing megatrends. Influx of Supply Not Expected to Derail Broad Recovery Due to construction delays in 2020, there will be an influx of upcoming supply of 28.8 million sf (msf) in 2021. This compares to 2020's net supply of only 3.8 msf. However, majority of incoming supply in 2021 are single-user factory space (12.3 msf) and business park space (1.3 msf) which have been mostly pre-committed. Warehouse supply is expected to increase by 4.8 msf in 2021, higher than the 5-year average annual net demand of 3.9 msf. New warehouse supply should see relatively good take-up rates, amidst current strong demand in 2021. Nonetheless, conventional warehouse rents are expected to remain flat in 2021. Notably, there would be around 9.5 msf of multi-user factory space coming online in 2021. This could weigh on conventional factory rents, which are expected to decline by 1.5% in 2021.

This is a respectable volume considering there were no public sites transacted in the quarter.The residential sector was the outperformer, coming in at 37.8% of investment sales, with the sale of private sites and strong luxury sales. In an enbloc sale, three sites at Institution Hill were sold to a local consortium for $33.60 mil. In two other collective sales, 6, 6A, 6B Mount Emily Road was sold for $18.00 mil while Surrey Point was sold for $47.80 mil. For luxury sales, 18 good class bungalows were sold, and another 31 apartments above $10.00 mil were transacted, 20 units of which were from Eden by Swire properties and sold collectively for $293.00 mil. Coming in a close second at $967.46 mil was industrial sales, boosted by a portfolio transaction of assets injected into the Boustead Industrial Fund by Boustead Projects Limited. Other sizeable transactions came from the office sector; this includes the sale of a 50% stake in OUE Bayfront for $633.75 mil, and the $150.00 mil sale of CertisCisco Centre to a trust set up by Certisand Lendlease for redevelopment. Despite travel restrictions still in place, foreign interest in Singapore assets remain strong with funds still actively seeking out investments. Investment volume is likely to improvewith the rollout of vaccination programs globally, border restrictions easing, and business confidence returning.Although investors are likely to remain discerning and cautious, spurred by the low interest rate environment and ample liquidity, they will still be in search of investments that provide them with higher returns, coupled with stability and value at the top of their minds. Due to their limited stock, Grade A offices and shophouses will still be in high demand. CBRE Research believes that investment volume in 2021 is likely to rebound on the back of a recovering economy, led by residential, office, and industrial sales.

This stemmed mainly from Dyson Limited's lease commitment atSt James Power Station which was added into total office stock for Q1 2021. In the past six months, CBRE Research has noted an uptick in leasing momentum. In particular, the Grade A (Core CBD) market also registered positive net absorption, as occupiers capitalised on the declining rents and moved to prime office buildings. Demand came from firms in the technology and financial services industries such as asset management firms, and to a smaller extent, family offices. In addition, the displacement of tenants from buildings scheduled for redevelopment such as AXA Tower and Fuji Xerox Towers have contributed to increased occupier activity over the past few months. With more flight to quality movement, the difference in the Grade A and Grade B markets became more stark. Supported by the tight vacancy in the Grade A (Core CBD) market, the rental decline was arrested after four quarters of correction. In Q1 2021, Grade A (Core CBD) rents remained stable q-o-q at $10.40 psf/month. Conversely, the Grade B market continued to grapple with higher vacancy rates and the Grade B (Core CBD) rents saw a further rental decline of 1.3% q-o-q to $7.80 psf/month. Although there remain concerns around the existing pool of secondary space, healthy take-up of secondary space within the Core CBD has indicated that interest for such fitted out space remains strong. Going forward, demand is expected to be supported by employment gains, a gradual recovery of the economy and a tight supply pipeline. However, it will not be a uniform recovery; the Grade A market is expected to be the main beneficiary as large corporates leverage on the pull-back in rents for an upgrade in location and quality.

A negative net absorption of -35,817 sq. ft. was noted, contributed by the City Fringe submarket. Consequently, islandwidevacancy saw a marginal increase of 0.1 percentage points q-o-q to 12.9%.Leasing activity was relatively subdued in Q1 2021, with renewals and relocations continuing to feature. While leasing demand was led by the technology sector, expansions from other sectors have eased, as firms become more conservative in their take-up. Further, more downsizing by companies with portions of employees working from home could be expected as they recalibrate their space requirements.Some landlords are becoming more flexible in rental negotiations as they seek to maintain occupancy levels. CBRE Research noted a fall in rents for both the City Fringe and Rest of Island submarkets; the former saw a 0.9% q-o-q drop to $5.75 psf/month whereas the latter declined by 1.4% q-o-q to $3.65 psf/month.Amid construction delays, the pipeline for 2021 now totals 1.40 mil sq. ft. This may place some pressure on rents, in particular for the Rest of Island submarket with some projects in CleanTechPark slated to complete this year. In addition, the total future pipeline will further increase with the inclusion of Perennial Business City, which has yet to be added as it is still pending rezoning approval from URA.Looking ahead, the updated safe management measures at workplaces, which took effect from 5 Apr, is likely to lend support to renewals and gradually aid in the overall recovery of the business parks market. However, with many occupiers expected to adopt hybrid models for the time being, the return to workplaces may be phased out as companies relook at their workplace strategies and flexible working arrangements. Meanwhile, quality will continue to be a priority for occupiers looking to relocate or expand. Buildings with higher specifications are therefore expected to see greater demand.

MARKETVIEWRetail indicators have continued to show signs of recovery. Unemployment has declined, while with the return of shopper traffic, business expectations have improved. With the protracted closure of tourism borders, local spending has increased. Retail sales (excluding motor vehicles), posted a y-o-y change of -1.3% and 3.5% in Jan and Feb 2021 respectively, a marked improvement as compared to the pre-pandemic period. For Q1 2021, retailers from the F&B, convenience stores and supermarkets sector were seen to be increasing their footprint. At the same time, they have reinvented concepts, creating new and innovative brands to gain market share. Leasing enquiries from boutique gyms, beauty, health and wellness related sectors remain relatively active, although their decision making process are taking longer.It was observed that there has been a slowdown in rental declines of prime retail spaces, from -3.6% q-o-q in Q4 2020 to -1.2% q-o-q this quarter. Notably, landlords continue to maintain a flexible stance towards rental expectations and leasing strategies to support tenants' requirements, favouring tenant retention over occupancy.Even though demand indicators are improving, the retail sector has yet to reach full recovery; it will be highly dependent on the global vaccine roll-out and how soon Singapore can reopen its borders. With these considerations, the retail sector is expected to bottom out in late 2021. As such, the recovery of the retail sector is likely to be a gradual one, potentially from 2022 onward, given that the retail sector is still highly challenged by e-commerce competition and labour woes. The introduction of the Code of Conduct (effective 1 Jun 2021) is a much welcome change and tilts the scale to achieve a more equitable balance in the leasing dynamics. It seeks to increase the competitiveness of Singapore's retail sector, which will be timely as the economy recovers from the pandemic.

Preliminary estimates for new home sales volume for Q1 2021 came to 3,376 units, which was 57.1% higher than the same period last year. This was bolstered by the sales of Normanton Park (728 units), Midtown Modern (362 units) and The Reef at King's Dock (343 units), which were all newly launched this quarter. Q1 2021's performance also indicated strong demand for high-end homes among local homebuyers.According to URA's flash estimates, private residential property prices rose in Q1 2021 for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by increasing buyers' confidence, pent-up demand and the low interest rate environment. It grew by another 2.9% q-o-q in Q1 2021, after a 2.1% q-o-q increase in the previous quarter. This was mainly attributed to the RCR, which rose by 6.1% q-o-q in Q1 2021, a bigger q-o-q increase than the 4.4% registered in Q4 2020. Transactions at The Reef at King's Dock (median unit price of $2,257 psf) were likely to have contributed to the higher psf prices registered in the RCR. In addition, there was healthy take-up from earlier launches in the suburban market, which signifies resilient demand from upgraders.To date, private property prices have increased by 6.2% since Q1 2020. This also raises the possibility that more cooling measures could be rolled out. At this pace, it is likely to exceed the government's GDP growth forecast of 4-6%, while the launch of some upcoming projects at higher psf pricing might continue to push the price index higher.Although these projects are predominantly located in the CCR and RCR locations, smaller sized units which tend to have an affordable price quantum will still be attractive and palatable investments. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, CBRE Research expects new home sales to fall within the region of 9,000 to 10,000 units for 2021. In the longer term, the potential reopening of borders will also bring about the return of foreign investors to the residential market.

Manufacturing output rose by 16.4% y-o-y in Feb, following its 9.2% y-o-y expansion in Jan, supported primarily by the electronics, biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering clusters; while NODX similarly increased 4.2% y-o-y in Feb, extending its growth from the previous two quarters. SIPMM's PMI maintained its strong performance, posting its ninth consecutive month of expansion in Mar at 50.8.Leasing activity was stable in Q1 2021, albeit slowing down from the strong performance of the previous sector. Transactions consisted mainly of renewals and relocations, along with a handful of new set ups and expansions. In particular, the warehouse submarket continued to be driven from the third-party logistics, e-commerce and food logistics segments. Meanwhile, some leasing activity was also observed for hi-tech factory buildings, primarily from the semiconductor, precision engineering and technology segments.Both factory and warehouse rents tracked by CBRE Research remained resilient this quarter, staying flat q-o-q for both the ground and upper floors. On the other hand, as vacancy remained low and demand continued to be robust, prime logistics rents grew 0.7% q-o-q to $1.39 psf/month in Q1 2021.Moving forward, while the saturated factory pipeline may place pressure on rents, high-specsbuildings will continue to be in demand along with the recovery of the manufacturing sector. Nonetheless, the factory submarket remains two-tier, and older buildings may continue to weigh on overall rental performance. Meanwhile, warehouse leasing demand is likely to remain stable, with upcoming supply expected to be absorbed gradually by the market. However, external pressures remain; with the ongoing global pandemic, as well as the Suez Canal blockage which may have knock-on effects on global trade.

This is the first positive turnaround after three consecutive quarters of decline. The economy expanded by 2.0% qoq in 1Q 2021, compared to an expansion by 3.8% qoq in 4Q 2020. * Economic activities were ramped up at the start of the year as the economy entered Phase 3 of recovery from 28th December 2021. After posting a strong 10.3% yoy growth, the manufacturing sector expanded by 7.5% yoy in 1Q 2021. Clusters such as electronics, precision engineering, chemicals and biomanufacturing performed better than the transport engineering and general manufacturing clusters, which experienced output declines. As the construction sector gradually picked up due to public and private sector demand, the contraction moderated to a decline of 20.2% yoy in 1Q 2021, an improvement from the 27.4% contraction in 4Q 2020. * The services sector fell by 1.2% yoy in 1Q 2021, an improvement from the drop of 4.7% in 4Q 2020. Among the services sectors, wholesale, retail trade and transportation & storage fell by 4.1% yoy in 1Q 2021, a slight improvement from the decline of 6.4% yoy in 4Q 2020. Accommodation & food services, real estate, administrative & support services and other services dropped by -3.9% yoy in 1Q 2021 from -9.9% in 4Q 2021. The bright spot was the information and communications, finance and insurance and professional services sector which grew 3.7% yoy in 1Q 2021 yoy from 1.4% in 4Q 2021.

The labour market conditions improved slightly in February 2021, as Singapore's overall unemployment rates fell to 3% from 3.2% in January, signifying a renewed confidence by firms to add to headcount. The labour market has turned the corner for now due to the various job support/conversion schemes initiated by the government. * The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded in April this year its 2021 growth outlook for Asia to 7.6% in 2021, up from the 6.9% forecasted as of October 2020. Global economic prospects have also brightened although the rising interest rates in the US could translate into higher borrowing costs. * Business and consumer confidence are rising due to the easing of border restrictions and the gradual rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines. Apart from travel dependent industries, we expect most sectors to experience stronger growth in 2021. MAS estimates Singapore's GDP growth in 2021 to fall within the upper range of their official forecasted growth of 4 to 6%. Cognizant of ongoing global and regional risks, MAS has maintained an accommodative monetary policy, keeping the rate of exchange rate appreciation at 0% per annum. 2 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Market commentary Investment sales Total investment sales nearly doubled from $2.5bn in Q4 2020 to $4.8bn in Q1 2021 (Figure 1). This was likely due to the improved business sentiments arising from Singapore's Phase 3 reopening on 28 December last year and the commencement of the Ministry of Health's (MOH) national vaccination programme that was piloted on 27 January this year. The recovery in investment sales is also reflective of the gradual pick-up of the construction sector, which posted a more moderate contraction of 20.2% yoy in Q1 2021, compared to the 27.4% contraction in Q4 2020. The public investment sales market recorded no activity in this quarter, given that there were no sites awarded under the public land sales programmes. This was in part due to the government's cautious approach towards releasing sites for tender given the COVID-19 pandemic and the prevailing macroeconomic situation at the end of last year. Furthermore, land parcels released under the 2H2020 GLS programme were granted longer tender periods by URA due to the COVID-19 situation and would only be awarded from Q2 2021 onward. On the other hand, the private investment sales market witnessed brisk activities and recorded 156% qoq growth, from $1.9bn in Q4 2020 to $4.8bn in Q1 2021. This was led by strong performances in the residential and office sectors, which posted total transaction amounts of $1.8bn and $1.6bn respectively, or 39% and 34% of Q1 2021's total investment sales (Figure 2). For the remaining sectors, industrial transactions made up 19% of total investment sales, followed by retail and shophouse transactions, which represented 5% and 3% of total investment sales respectively. There were no investment sales in the hospitality sector.

Table 3: Investment sales summary Source: Various sources, EDMUND TIE Research 4 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Sector trends and outlook * There were three significant office transactions in Q1 2021, with the highest amount posted by the divestment of 50% of OUE Bayfront by OUE Commercial REIT to Allianz Real Estate for $633.8mn (Table 4). The other significant transactions were the sale of Certis Cisco Centre at 20 Jalan Afifi for $150mn, and 108 Robinson Road for $142.8mn. These key transactions marked a contrast to Q4 2020, where there were no significant office transactions, and point to a possible return of interest for the office sector given that with effect from 5th April 2021, 75% of staff can return to their workplace at any one time and working from home is no longer the default arrangement. * Industrial investment sales amounted to $897.4mn in Q1 2021, more than doubling the $375.4mn recorded in Q4 2020. There were three significant industrial transactions, namely the sale of 20 - 23 Rochester Park at $144.8mn, followed by BreadTalk Group's divestment of BreadTalk IHQ at 30 Tai Seng Street for $118mn, and AIMS APAC REIT's $102mn acquisition of Sime Darby Business Centre at 315 Alexandra Road. * For retail investment sales, the sole significant transaction in Q1 2021 was FCT's divestment of YewTee Point for $220mn to unrelated parties. The shopping mall has around 70 tenants spread over 74,000 sq ft of NLA. This transaction marked FCT's third retail mall divestment over three consecutive quarters, adding to the REIT's divestment of Bedok Point and Anchorpoint Shopping Centre in Q3 2020 and Q4 2020 respectively. * There were two significant residential transactions in Q1 2021. The first was the $293mn sale of all 20 units of Eden, a freehold luxury condominium by Swire Properties at 2 Draycott Park, to the members of the Tsai family of Want Want China Holdings. The second was the sale of a Good Class Bungalow (GCB) at 30 Nassim Road to a private investor for $128.8mn. Apart from these, the residential sector was abuzz with 10 other transactions greater than $30mn each in Q1 2021, of which 7 were recorded by GCBs. The stark pick-up in transaction activities in Q1 2021 relative to the previous quarter is indicative of the improving appetite amongst investors. As MOH's ongoing vaccination drive helps the nation achieve herd immunity against COVID-19 and consequently normalcy in the economy, investment activity could be bolstered for the rest of 2021.

Within the CBD and Non-CBD, there was a flight to quality by corporates. Due to the tight vacancies, premium grade office rents held steady in the quarter. In addition, with the impending redevelopment of AXA Tower and Fuji Xerox Towers, there is some leasing demand from the displaced tenants seeking to lease alternative office premises. The steepest declines were recorded in Raffles Place Grade A and Shenton Way/Robinson Road/Tanjong Pagar Grade B as vacancies rose. In the Orchard Road and decentralised areas, leasing activity was limited but rents were broadly unchanged. Office demand and occupancy rates * With effect from 5th April 2021, 75% of staff can return to their workplace at any one time and working from home is no longer the default arrangement. Even as more workers gradually return to their office premises, some employees have indicated a preference for work-from-home arrangements, citing productivity gains and reduced commute times. As a result, businesses remain cautious about expanding traditional office spaces as they deliberated on the ideal hybrid working model. * Major banks are reviewing their operations and shrinking their physical offices. It was reported that DBS plans to shed 75,000 sq ft at Marina Bay Financial (MBFC) Tower Three, while Standard Chartered is also considering giving up its space in MBFC Tower One. ANZ Singapore is also considering terminating one floor of its current existing space in Ocean Financial Centre in 2021. * Co-working operator Just-Co had recently announced in March 2021 that it will be opening another office in Tampines located at Asia Green, after an announcement for an expansion located in One-North (30,000 sq ft). Bridge+ by CapitaLand also opened another co-working office at 79 Robinson Road in January 2021, three years after the debut of its Bridge+ flagship co-working office in Ascent building at Singapore Science Park 1. * Based on EDMUND TIE Research statistics, overall net absorption islandwide declined from a robust 390,000 sq ft in 4Q 2020 to 74,000 sq ft in 1Q 2021. The islandwide occupancy rate remained stabilised remaining at 93.3% in 1Q 2021 (Figure 3).

Even as major banks continue to downsize their office spaces, demand for office spaces continues to be fuelled by technology, fintech and finance companies. Singapore has been a regional base for Western companies and is now becoming a hub for Chinese technology companies. This is supported by the office expansion of Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance, as they ramp up the hiring process to recruit more talents in Singapore, especially talents who are trained in the technology sector. The recent announcement of Google co-founder Sergey Brin opening a family office in Singapore will buoy investor confidence in Singapore as a financial hub. We expect more businesses to sign on leases with co-working operators due to the flexibility and shorter-term commitments. As companies endeavour to accommodate their employees' preferences to work with some form of flexibility, the trend of co-working spaces might be preferred by companies looking for a change from traditional workspaces. Even for traditional offices, we are seeing a gradual transition to integrate more communal spaces for people to connect and engage in meaningful collaborations. Supply pipeline Based on EDMUND TIE Research, there are nearly 4.5mn sq ft of new office space that will be completed from 2021 to 2024 (Figure 4). Most of the office developments will be completed in 2021 (28.03% or 1.36mn sq ft) and 2024 (28.05% or 1.4mn sq ft). Close to half (47.2%) of the supply pipeline from 2021 (28% or 1.4mn sq ft) to 2024 will be in the CBD, followed by 32.2% in Decentralised Areas. The larger developments include Central Boulevard towers (1.26mn sq ft) which is slated to be completed in 2023 and an office/ retail development by SP Group (640,000 sq ft) located at Pasir Panjang Road and scheduled to be completed in 2024. 7 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL Market commentary Key indicators The manufacturing sector expanded for the ninth consecutive months in March 2021 and the PMI reading is the highest since March 2019. The PMI reading expanded by 0.3 points from February 2021 to 50.8 in March 2021 (Table 6). NODX increased 9.7% yoy in 1Q 2021, after a -0.5% fall in 4Q 2020. Demand and occupancy * Based on JTC's statistics, overall industrial net absorption increased from 1.2mn sq ft in 3Q 2020 to 2.3mn sq ft in 4Q 2020. The full-year absorption declined from 7.9mn sq ft in 2019 to 7.5mn sq ft in 2020 (-4.0%). In 4Q 2020, occupancy rates of single-user factory space, multiuser factory space, and business park and warehouse space increased (Figure 5). The two industrial segments, which saw the greatest increase are multi-user factory occupancy, which improved by 0.8% qoq and business park occupancy, which improved by 0.5% qoq in 4Q 2020. Rents * Based on EDMUND TIE Research's industrial property basket, monthly rents were broadly flat for most industrial segments in 1Q 2021 (Table 7). Although upper-storey factory rents fell by -0.5% qoq in 1Q 2021, it was a smaller decline compared to 4Q 2020 (-1.0%). * We expect hi-tech industrial properties to perform better than the other industrial stock due to the government's push for Key economic indicators 4Q 2020 1Q 2021 Key trends NODX (Yoy) -0.5% 9.7% * NODX growth was led by the electronics sector (14.8%) in 1Q 2021 while non- electronic NODX posted growth of 8.4% in 1Q 2021. The largest contributor was China, which contributed 15.3% to exports. This is followed by United States, which contributed to 12.8% in exports.

Various major multinational firms have raised interest in developing facilities to develop and manufacture vaccines. Thermo Fisher Scientific will be investing $174 million, and their facility will be operational in 2022, the plant will manufacture a wide range of vaccines and therapeutics. Another global biopharmaceutical company Sanofi will be investing $639 million over five years for their new vaccine site, their first vaccine production centre in Asia, where construction is expected to start in Q3 2021. There has also been increasing focus on the environmental impact of industrial properties in Singapore, especially for data centres. Digital Realty recently opened its third and largest data centre in Singapore, which received the Building and Construction Authority's highest Green Mark Platinum certification. Moving forward, we can expect a shift towards more environmentally sustainable infrastructures, as companies increasingly adopt an ESG agenda. We expect industrial rents to bottom out this year, led by the high-tech and warehouse segment as the drive towards e-commerce and hi-tech manufacturing continues. However, the looming supply pipeline in 2021 will moderate such an increase. advanced manufacturing as Singapore prepares for Industry 4.0. In 1Q 2021, hi- tech industrial rents rose by 0.5% qoq. There has been a preference for modern specifications due to a rise in e-commerce, food logistics, and medical manufacturing. Older industrial buildings will likely see a decline in demand, resulting in a two- tiered industrial market. Supply pipeline * As of 4Q 2020, the supply pipeline from 2021 to 2024 is projected to be around 41.7mn sq ft (NLA). Approximately 53% of the pipeline will be completed in 2021, followed by 30.7% in 2022 (12.8mn sq ft). The hike in potential completions in 2021 was due to the delay in the completion of projects and new supply being rolled over from 2020. Multi-user factories accounted for the bulk (33%) of the supply pipeline (Figure 6). The larger multi-user factory developments in the pipeline are Solaris @ Tai Seng (929,000 sq ft) and Mapletree Industrial Trust located at Kallang Way (710,000 sq ft). With the excess supply of industrial projects in 2021, we will also expect to see more subdued rents for industrial spaces. 9 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH RETAIL Market commentary Key indicators * With the pandemic situation relatively well contained in Singapore, coupled with a stabilisation in the labour market, businesses and consumers have gradually regained a sense of normalcy. * Starting from 5th April 2021, the number of employees allowed to go back to work has been raised from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. This could potentially drive more footfall in the central area, as retail operators are largely dependent on the lunchtime working crowds for their business. * Traditional brick and mortar stores located in Chinatown ramped up digitalisation with a committee formed by IMDA, ESG and STB. Chope and Qoo10 have been appointed to assist the tenants to drive more sales and footfall into the area, by providing guidance and training on digital marketing. * Although the growth of e-commerce is set in motion, there is still a role for physical retail and placemaking activities, as consumers still need avenues for socialisation. * A set of guidelines termed the Fair Tenancy Framework Code of Conduct for Leasing of Retail Premises has been developed recently, which is set to come into effect from 1 June 2021. It is a set of guidelines to assist landlords and tenants of qualifying premises (which include, but is not limited to retail, F&B, clinics, and schools) to reach a fair and balanced position in lease negotiations. * The 3-month moving average retail sales growth (excluding motor vehicles) improved to -1.6% yoy in February 2021 from -5.1% in January 2021 (Figure 7). The Retail Sales Index improved 7.9% in February 2021, which marked the first month of growth since January 2020. This was driven by an improvement in consumer sentiment and greater shopping footfall. -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 Retail sales Index % Source: Department of Statistics Singapore Figure 7: Retail sales growth (Three-year moving average) (excluding motor vehicles) -60% -40% -20% 0% 20% 40% Department Stores Supermarkets & Hypermarkets Mini-marts & Convenience Stores Food & Alcohol Motor Vehicles Petrol Service Stations Cosmetics, Toiletries & Medical Goods Wearing Apparel & Footwear Furniture & Household Equipment Recreational Goods Watches & Jewellery Computer & Telecommunications Equipment Optical Goods & Books Others Retail sales excl motor vehicles Source: Department of Statistics Singapore Figure 8: Retail sales index (Feb 2021), yoy change * In February 2021, Watches & Jewellery saw the greatest improvement of 37% on a yoy basis, followed by Computer & Telecommunications Equipment which grew by 20% yoy (Figure 8).

However, due to the restrictions of large gatherings, this has resulted in lower demand for event catering.

Given the strong retail performance in Fringe/Suburban Areas, as a result of the catchment population and extensive work-from-home arrangements, rents have ticked up accordingly. Supply pipeline Based on EDMUND TIE Research, around 1mn sq ft of NLA is expected to be completed islandwide from 2021 to 2024. The bulk of the supply pipeline is expected to be completed in 2021 (39.0%) and 2023 (39.0%) (Figure 11). The majority (87.0%) of the supply pipeline will emerge from the Fringe/Suburban Areas. Outlook Following a series of closures by international brands, Abercrombie & Fitch is the latest international brand that is to exit from Singapore, as it closed its last physical retail outlet in Singapore and shifts to an exclusively online store.

We expect rents in the Orchard/ Scotts Road and Other city areas to trade sideways for the rest of this year amid continued border restrictions and flexible work arrangements. A bright spot would be suburban retail, which caters directly to the needs of residents in their catchment. Suburban rents will post an increase for the year, tempered slightly by the new forthcoming supply. 13 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Source: URA Figure 13: Private homes sales volume (excluding ECs) and URA All Residential Price Index * Total private home sales volume in 1Q 2021 amounted to 8,100 units, 16.9% higher than the sales volume of 6,929 units in 4Q 2020 (Figure 13). We believe that demand was driven by low interest rates, strong liquidity, improving buyer sentiment and the wealth effect of the rising financial markets. * New sales volumes increased from 2,603 units in 4Q 2020 to 3,493 units in 1Q 2021. New sales in 1Q 2021 were 62.5% higher than that a year ago and 34.2% higher on the quarter (Figure 13). The share of primary sales to total transaction volume rose from 37.6% in 4Q 2020 to 43.1% in 1Q 2021. * Secondary sales volumes increased slightly from 4,326 units in 4Q 2020 to 4,607 units in 1Q 2021. * In 1Q 2021, there were five new launches (Table 10), excluding ECs. 2,743 units were launched in 1Q 2021 compared with 2,422 units in 4Q 2020. * The Reef at King's Dock, launched in January 2021, is in the Keppel Bay precinct near Habourfront MRT station.

In a COVID-19 year, the resilient manufacturing sector played a huge role in cushioning the fallout on the economy, with substantial output expansions in the electronics, biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering clusters. Demand for electronics remains high due to the current global chip shortage. And with Singapore as a major manufacturer of semiconductors, chipmakers in the industrial sector may be compelled to expand existing facilities in order to increase output production. In March 2021, the Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) reported an expansion of 50.8, the highest since March 2019. The optimism among manufacturers prevailed in January and February where the PMI expanded by 50.7 and 50.5 respectively, indicating that the industrial sector is likely to see continued growth in 2021. 1The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of all industrial space in January and February 2021 are based on a two-month comparison; q-o-q (against October and November 2020) and y-o-y (against January and February 2020).

This is expected to churn out up to 1,000 tonnes of fish a year. By 2023, the total output capacity would be 2,700 tonnes a year. Emerging as the main driver of national growth in a pandemic-stricken year, the manufacturing sector is in pole position to lead the expected economic recovery in 2021. This will be supported by the electronics cluster given the heightened demand for 5G technologies as well as the production of electronic goods that has been affected by the global chip shortage. Additionally, the transport engineering cluster might turn a corner with controlled travel envisaged to rise with the implementation of bilateral travel corridors with low to moderate infection rate countries, most likely in the second half of 2021. Moving forward, about 56.1 million sq ft gross floor area (GFA) of new industrial space is forecasted to be completed between 2021 to 2024. Of these, about 51.3% of the new supply is projected to be completed in 2021, with single-user and multiple-user factory space forming a significant proportion. While this might put pressure on the rents of factory space, more firms may expand their headcounts and the size of their facilities to cater for increased output production in light of anticipated economic recovery. Factory space rents might increase marginally in 2021, between 1% and 3%. Market outlook"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

This turnaround occurred after fi ve consecutive quarters of decline. * Given the scarcity of such assets, prices of freehold properties remained resilient, inching up slightly by 0.2% to S$701 per sq ft. * Similarly, average prices across Savills basket of 60-year leasehold properties rose by 1.9% QoQ to S$432 sq ft. However, 30-year leasehold property values declined for a sixth straight quarter, falling by 2.5% QoQ to S$292 per sq ft. * With business parks facing challenges, evident from increases in vacancy, the average monthly rent in Savills basket of prime and standard business park properties contracted on a QoQ basis, by 0.9% and 1.2% to S$5.76 and S$3.96 per sq ft respectively. * While some of business park occupiers moved to less costly high-spec industrial space, the average monthly rent for Savills high-spec industrial basket also fell by 0.5% QoQ to S$3.48 per sq ft, after a 0.9% QoQ increase in Q4/2020. * With some industries are performing better than others, our rental forecast for multiple-user factory and warehouse space is maintained at -3.0% to 0% (multiple-user factory) and +1.0% to 3.0% (warehouse).

This came as a surprise as economists had previously forecast a contraction in GDP. The growth in GDP was largely attributed to continual expansion in the manufacturing sector of 7.5% YoY in the fi rst quarter, after growing 10.3% in Q4/2020, along with moderated contractions in the construction and services sectors. Output expansions in the electronics, precision engineering, chemicals and biomedical manufacturing clusters outweighed output contractions in the transport, engineering and general manufacturing clusters. Manufacturing sentiment continued to improve with the overall Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) in expansionary mode for nine consecutive months. In March 2021, the PMI recorded a faster rate of growth by 0.3 points from February to 50.8, the highest since March 2019 when the PMI was also 50.8. Similarly, the electronics sector PMI also registered its eighth straight month of expansion, albeit a dip of 0.2 points from February to 50.6 in March. Despite a global chip shortage which may aff ect consumer electronics, the electronics sector is still expected to grow on the back of higher demand for semiconductors. Moreover, external trade was also largely healthy, with non-oil domestic exports (NODX) recording a YoY growth for Q1/2021. In March 2021, NODX expanded by 12.1% YoY, stronger than February's 4.2%. Electronics NODX rose 24.4% in March 2021 from a low base a year ago, which was led by an increase in exports of integrated circuits amid strong global semiconductor demand and chip shortages. Non-electronic NODX growth accelerated to 9.4% in March 2021 after registering 3.2% in the previous month. This was largely attributable to petrochemicals, specialised machinery and pharmaceuticals. RENTAL MARKET The leasing market remained active in Q1/2021, with leasing volume1 increasing for a third consecutive quarter by 1.3% QoQ and 21.2% YoY to 2,950 transactions. Among the property types, leases of multiple-user factories increased the most, rising by 23.9% YoY to 2,320 transactions. This may be due to tenant relocations and renewal of leases with some downsizing due to cost-cutting measures. Apart from multiple-user factories, rental transactions of other property types also rose on a YoY basis. The leasing volume of single- user factory units increased by 14.3% YoY to 184 transactions while for warehouses volumes 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factories as well as warehouse space). grew by 11.5% from 400 in Q1/2020 to 414 in Q1/2021. Rental demand for warehouse space continued to be supported by logistics and e-commerce players as they looked to expand their operations, sourcing larger units to house their operations in a single location. The overall industrial vacancy rate eased for a fourth consecutive quarter in Q1/2021, albeit a slower pace of 0.1 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to 10.0%, the lowest since Q1/2016, when vacancy rates were below 10.0%, at 9.9%. This was due to increasing demand as conditions in the manufacturing sector start to improve, as well as delayed completions. The QoQ decline of 0.5 of a ppt for multiple-user factory space outweighed the QoQ increases of 0.1 of a ppt in vacancy rate for single-user factory and warehouse space respectively. As the economic recovery broadens across various fronts, JTC's rental indices refl ected this with increases across all property types. The rental index of all industrial property grew by 0.6% QoQ in Q1/2021. Similarly, for Savills basket of industrial properties, the average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 rebounded, increasing by 1.1% QoQ to S$1.72 per sq ft. This turnaround came after fi ve consecutive quarters of decline and was led by the strong growth in the manufacturing sector. In the same light, the average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics3 properties continued to inch up further, albeit at a slower pace, rising by 0.5% QoQ to S$1.44 per sq ft. This was supported by strong demand for warehouse space from e-commerce, logistics, stockpiling and shifts in supply chains. SALES MARKET In the strata sales market, after two consecutive quarters of increase, sales volumes declined 21.6% QoQ to 366 in Q1/2021. However, on a YoY basis, the transaction volume in Q1/2021 almost doubled from the 196 recorded in the same period last year. Demand came from local fi rms such as those in the disposable Tupperware and frozen food processing business. Local companies which had in the past leased space are now willing to purchase as they see attractive pricing in the market. Many of the local companies buying have benefi ted from the fallout from the pandemic. The improvement in the industrial market was observed with the JTC price index of all industrial property registering a 0.9% QoQ growth for a second consecutive quarter. However, on a YoY basis, the price index recorded a decline of 1.3%. The 0.9% increase was largely led by a 1.1% QoQ growth in the price index of single-user factories, while multiple-user factories rose by 0.9% QoQ.

After four consecutive quarters of decline, prices for 60-year leasehold properties rebounded by 1.9% QoQ to S$432 per sq ft in Q1/2021. On the other hand, prices of 30-year leasehold properties fell for a sixth straight quarter, declining 2.5% QoQ from S$299 per sq ft in Q4/2020 to S$292 per sq ft in Q1/2021. More properties with shorter leases have been for sale in the market. Sellers of such properties do not see the need to hold on to their assets, particularly due to uncertainties arising from the pandemic. Separately, prices of freehold properties remained resilient, with a marginal QoQ increase of 0.2% to S$701 per sq ft. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPECS INDUSTRIAL After registering positive net demand for the past two quarters, net demand fell back into negative territory of -75,300 sq ft in Q1/2021. This was largely led by a decline in take-up of 161,500 sq ft in the Central Region. As a result, the islandwide vacancy rate rose by 0.7 of a ppt from 14.2% in Q4/2020 to 14.9% in Q1/2021, the highest since vacancy rates reached the 15.1% registered in Q4/2018. The increase was mainly due to fi rms moving out of business parks. While occupancy rates of new business parks increased in the quarter, older parks continued to face greater challenges in attracting or retaining tenants. Nevertheless, demand for business park space continued to emanate from technology and fi ntech fi rms which have thrived during the pandemic. However, for some fi ntech companies, they may still prefer to take up conventional offi ce space which imparts a more professional image compared with business parks or high spec industrial space. Although the JTC rental index for business parks recorded a marginal QoQ increase of 0.1% for a second consecutive quarter, the average monthly rent in Savills basket of prime business park properties5 registered its fi rst decline since Q2/2020 of -0.9% QoQ to S$5.76 per sq ft. Similarly, the average monthly rent of Savills basket of standard business park properties6 declined for a fourth consecutive quarter by a larger 1.2% QoQ to S$3.96 per sq ft as this type of space needs to provide greater fl exibility in rental negotiations to maintain occupancy rates. As companies adopt cost-cutting measures amid uncertainties from how the pandemic will pan out, some of the demand for high-spec industrial space came from fi rms moving out of business parks to high-spec industrial units, which are less costly (for older buildings) but still able to provide a respectable corporate look. Nevertheless, as with business parks, the average monthly rent for Savills 4 Only include upper-storey strata-titled factory (single- and multiple-user factory) and warehouse units, excluding all ground fl oor units. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. high-spec industrial basket7 declined by 0.5% QoQ to S$3.48 per sq ft in Q1/2021 after a QoQ increase of 0.9% in Q4/2020. With fi rms remaining budget conscious, older high-spec buildings may be better received by tenants. Demand for such space is expected to be stable in the long term, emanating from the technology, media and telecommunications and electronics sectors, which continue to perform well. OUTLOOK One year into the pandemic, driven by the need to buff er against supply chain disruptions, demand for biomedical devices and a global shortage of semiconductors, the industrial market continues to perform better than most other real estate sectors. The heavy demand for the products from the latter two industries have spurred on the chemical industry as well. Broadly speaking, the manufacturing and logistics sectors have two driving forces. One is knowledge intensive while the other is basically supply chain in nature. Between these two lie pockets of demand from the food industry and those who try to save rental overheads by moving to lower cost premises. How these two tracks will fare in the coming year will determine the outlook for the factory, warehouse and business park markets. Notwithstanding the broad vaccination program underway here, the pandemic has reared its head again with community cases spiking in late-March to the time of this writing. Overseas, the pandemic in some countries has been counted in multiple waves. So long as the threat of a resurgence in infections lingers, the demand for industrial space should remain fi rm. Remote working and the drive to achieve ESG (Environment Social and Governance) targets will spur demand for new technologies and materials. All these are likely to result in greater manufacturing activity in the semiconductor and chemical sectors here as most of the global companies have set up operations. The knowledge intensive industries are likely to continue to operate and even expand at the various locations earmarked for specifi c clusters. Local Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) are often not in such industries and their performance will be patchy. However, at a micro-locational level, they are likely to continue to look to set up in more central locations. The pandemic has decimated the industrial market in various ways. While the traditional users from industries such as oil & gas and ship building are still weighed down by problems which affl icted them prior to the viral outbreak, others who were doing well prior to 2020 are now starting to settle down to a lower level of activity. However, there are those who have not been faring well over the past few years, who have started to see their fortunes brighten. The following points highlight some of the observations that we have noticed of late. 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft. * Local Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) have been active in the quarter in review and are expected to remain interested in acquiring industrial properties for their own use. Examples of such companies are those in the manufacturing of Tupperware (mainly for export), processing of frozen food (the latter often needing 5,000 built in to 40,000-50,000 sq ft of land). These local enterprises are taking this opportunity where prices softened to acquire properties where the lease is often less than 30 years. The shorter-term lease means they can rein in non-production related capital expenditure. Food zoned industrial buildings and central kitchens located in the Central and Eastern parts of the island are still highly sought after. * Warehouse - rental demand from e-commerce (200,000 sq ft leasing demand). Companies in the e-commerce and last mile transportation industries have been actively looking for logistics space. A year ago, the pandemic was viewed with uncertainty and short-term leases for stock piling were popular. However, with the realization that COVID is not likely to go away anytime soon, these short leases have extended from half a year to a year or more. E-commerce fi rms have been sourcing in the Central and Eastern regions for space, often <100,000 sq ft. These are often around Kallang, Bendemeer and Tampines where easy access to expressways makes them more conducive for last mile delivery. They would have liked to lease larger areas but for the fact that most of the warehouse space in the abovementioned regions is smaller than in the West. For the Western region, as these areas have more warehouse space which off ers larger fl oor plates and higher ceiling heights, they are popular amongst tenants who require general storage facilities e.g. fashion companies, where there is less of a delivery time requirement. * Self-storage - Investor demand and rental demand have remained elevated. As they are the equivalent to co-working operators providing short term fl exi leases, they have become popular amongst tenants who have downsized from larger premises where lease terms are more rigid. * Light and high-spec industrial space - Tenants signing up for <20,000 sq ft in the quarter have been those from the IT, procurement and technology companies. For the rents charged, the look and feel of the buildings present it as value for money. * Business Parks - First generation parks are generally facing challenges. Counterintuitively, for some of the newer and well-located ones, there has been some resistance by tenants to Industrial 4 savills.com.sg/insight-and-opinion/ expand or locate there. Some technology fi rms with smaller spatial needs are fi nding Grade B offi ce space in the CBD to be an attractive proposition because rents for such buildings have fallen signifi cantly since the start of the pandemic and now overlap some of those charged in better located business parks. Although the performance of the industrial market is still mixed, we see that the worst is behind us. It is not that it is about to expand sharply across locations and types of buildings, but there will be PERIOD YoY % CHANGE IN MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY RENTS YoY % CHANGE IN WAREHOUSE & LOGISTICS RENTS 2021F -3.0% to 0.0% +1.0% to 3.0% TABLE 1: Rental Forecast For Multiple-User Factory And Warehouse & Logistics Segments Source Savills Research & Consultancy some that are growing whilst some still languish due to COVID-related reasons.
