Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Manufacturing Sector Leading Economic Growth Singapore's economic performance improved, with a contraction of only 5.8% yoy in Q3 2020 as compared to 13.2% yoy in Q2 2020. Economic growth was driven by the phased resumption of activities, following the Circuit Breaker in Q2 2020. The manufacturing sector was the star outperformer and expanded by 10.0% yoy in Q3 2020. Manufacturing expansion was largely attributed to output growth in the biomedical manufacturing, electronics and precision engineering clusters on the back of a global boom in the semiconductor industry. Also, the Singapore's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a key barometer for manufacturing sentiments, remains in positive territory at 50.5 points for six consecutive months since July 2020. This bodes well for the industrial market as the manufacturing economy is showing signs of recovery. Demand for Good Quality Business Parks Decentralised and high-quality business park space will be in demand, as firms explore new ways of working. The adoption of flexible working arrangements are expected to increase, supporting a flight-to-value trend. The rationale for a central office location due talent retention should weaken as the adoption of flexible working arrangement increases. Good quality decentralised business park spaces offer a credible alternative for eligible companies seeking to reduce costs. Given the rising demand for such spaces, investors are on the look out for redevelopment or asset enhancement opportunities. For example, Perennial Real Estate Holdings recently acquired Big Box in Jurong East and obtained permission to rezone the site to business park. The redeveloped development will be renamed as Perennial Business City and will offer around 1.1 million square foot (NLA) of business park space in Jurong. A Mixed Bag of Performance The outlook for industrial market is mixed depending on the segment. City Fringe business parks rents have risen by 1.6% for the whole of 2020 and is expected to continue to rise in 2021, on the back of a flight-to-value trend for quality business parks. Outlying business parks rents have fallen by 5.3% in 2020, but this was mainly due to older stock in the submarket. Science park rents registered mild growth in 2020, growing 0.3% yoy. Prime logistics rents which have risen by 1.7% yoy in 2020, will continue to outperform on the back of an e-commerce boom and preference for ramp-up logistics facilities. Also, conventional warehouses rents have largely remained resilient and grew 0.3% in 2020. Overall high-tech and conventional factory rents have declined in tandem with weak economic conditions. For 2021, high-tech factory rents should stabilise, bolstered by bio-medical, electronics demand. On the other hand, conventional factory rents are expected to remain weak amidst an uncertain economic recovery and a continued slowdown in construction activities.

MARKETVIEWAlong with improving economic indicators, preliminary real estate investment volume in Singapore increased by 15.7% q-o-q, to $3.248 bn for Q4 2020, a second consecutive quarter of increase. This amounts to $11.142 bn of investment volume for 2020, which is a 52.4% drop from the previous year, and also marks the lowest volume since the financial crisis in 2009 ($7.700 bn).The residential sector was the outperformer, coming in at 58.5% of investment sales this quarter, due to the sale of two public sites, as well as a selection of private residential sites. The office sector also came in strongly at 23.4% of sales with the sale of Keppel Bay Tower to Keppel REIT for $657.20 mil. Retail sector sales came in at $187.80 mil, or a decline of 72.1% q-o-q, with the sale of Anchorpointfor $110.00 mil. On the other hand, industrial volume came in at $181.98 mil, a drop of 56.1% q-o-q, with the sale of Big Box, for $118.00 mil. The project will be converted into a business park, Perennial Business City. Investment market activity is likely to continue to be dominated by local players, with foreign investment volume easing by 86.6% q-o-q. Existing travel restrictions are attributed as a large deterrent factor.Nevertheless, real estate investment sales in Singapore is likely to get a shot in the arm as vaccination programs are rolled out, with business sentiments picking up and border restrictions gradually eased. Although investors are likely to remain discerning and cautious, spurred by the low interest rate environment and ample liquidity, they will still be in search of investments that provide them with higher returns, coupled with stability and value at the top of their minds. As an investment destination, Singapore fits this bill with its proven ability to handle the pandemic, macroeconomic stability and political-neutrality. CBRE Research believes that investment volume in 2021 is likely to rebound, led by residential, office, and industrial sales. There could also be renewed interest in acquiring retail and hospitality at more opportunistic levels.

Despite the ongoing downsizing exercises, preliminary estimates for Q4 2020 indicators seemed to suggest that the reduction in occupied space has slowed. In the absence of no new completions, the office market registered a net absorption of -14,800 sq. ft. Cumulatively, net absorption for the whole of 2020 amounted to -0.56 mil sq. ft. This trailed behind its annual net supply of 0.32 mil sq. ft. Coupled with lower occupancy of the new-builds upon completion, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, vacancy rate rose from 4.5% in Q4 2019 to 6.0% in Q4 2020.The impending vacancy rise in the market has led to continued downward pressure on office rents. In Q4 2020, Grade A (Core CBD) office rents declined for its fourth consecutive quarter to $10.40 psf/month. This represented a full year decline of 10.0% in Grade A (Core CBD) office rents, which reversed the rental growth of 6.9% in 2019.Some cutback in large occupiers' footprint has resulted in an increase in secondary space, however this also presented more quality, fitted-out options for incoming potential tenants. It was observed that such tenants were open to taking over fitted premises as it reduced the need for capital expenditure.In the wake of the pandemic, demand is likely to remain subdued in 1H 2021. Nonetheless, there are some bright spots for demand. Chinese technology companies and non-bank financial services firms continue to display expansionary appetite. Also, the displacement of tenants from buildings slated for redevelopment will contribute to overall occupier activity. Should economic activity and business sentiment improve on the back of the vaccine rollout, the office market is poised to benefit from employment gains. Coupled with the improved leasing activity and limited Grade A supply in 2021, there are prospects for rents to turn upwards by 2H 2021.

Islandwidenet absorption was 50,488 sq. ft. in Q4 2020, its second consecutive quarter of positive net absorption. This was primarily contributed by a pick-up in demand within the Rest of island submarket. This led to islandwidevacancy rate dipping from 13.0% in Q3 2020 to 12.8% in Q4 2020. Renewals continued to feature prominently in leasing activity. For 2020 as a whole, the technology sector continued to be a demand driver for the business park market, especially in the City Fringe submarket. At the same time, JustCois opening a 30,000 sq. ft. centre within the upcoming South-east Asian headquarters of Razer Inc. This co-working facility is scheduled to open in Q2 2021. Given the tight vacancy in the City Fringe submarket, more cost conscious occupiers are seeking space within the Rest of island submarket. This is further spurred by the wide rental delta between the two tiers of the business park market. With the performance of the business park market displaying some resilience in this quarter, rents in the City Fringe and Rest of Island submarkets kept steady at $5.80 psf/month and $3.70 psf/month respectively. In December, it was announced that the former Big Box was acquired by a consortium led by Perennial Real Estate Holdings Pte Ltd. Renamed Perennial Business City, it was reported that Perennial has obtained JTC's confirmation to rezone this site from Business-1 (White) to Business Park. This will introduce approximately 1.10 mil sq. ft. of business park space into the market as the redevelopment project completes progressively from Q4 2021. Given the strong emphasis of high-tech industries, demand for business park market will continue to remain steady. However, with limited opportunities within the City Fringe submarket, this may result in more transactions within the outlying decentralised areas.

Nonetheless, compared to the previous quarter, there was greater positivity in the retail market with shopper traffic recovering to about 60% to 80% of pre-COVID-19 levels. The slight pickup in economic activities, travel restrictions and mega sales events have also led to a higher consumption of goods and services domestically. Retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) declined by 2.5% y-o-y in Nov 2020, as compared to a decline of 12.4% y-o-y in the previous month. Leasing activity for expansions and new openings accelerated slightly, but this was mainly confined to the F&B and supermarket segments. On the other hand, prominent closures were recorded in the weaker performing segments. Robinsonsannounced the closure of its last two department stores, Marks & Spencerconsolidated by closing its Raffles City outlet, while AW Lab, multi-brand sportswear retailer exited Singapore after their debut in 2017.Rental performance of suburban malls remained resilient but further q-o-q declines were registered in all other submarkets due to their higher reliance on tourist and office footfall. This led average prime islandwide retail rents to fall by a further 3.4% q-o-q in Q4 2020. Notably, landlords prioritised maintaining occupancy and rental expectations have become more realistic, particularly for spaces in secondary locations and floors. To date, average prime islandwide retail rents declined by 8.6% for 2020. While the economy is stabilising and Phase 3 of reopening will lend some positivity to the sector in 2021, hiring sentiments are still cautious and there are still uncertainties on the vaccine efficacy and how the global pandemic is going to pan out. The sector will continue to remain under pressure. However, landlords and tenants who are quick enough to readapt and seize opportunities could establish a head start in an environment where market recovery could be a long and uneven one.

Market sentiment and buyer's confidence remained strong, undeterred by the woes surrounding the pandemic.Preliminary estimates for new home sales volume for Q4 2020 amounted to 2,510 units, which was 2.7% higher than the same period last year. Sales in the resale market also helped to prop up the new home sales market. At 3,540 units, this was equivalent to an increase of 51.2% y-o-y. According to URA flash estimates, the private residential property price index rose for the third consecutive quarter, as it increased by a further 2.1% in Q4 2020. The pace of private home prices was also the fastest since Q2 2018, supported mainly by benchmark prices set by new project launches in Q4 2020, though it was mainly driven by transactions in the RCR (4.8% q-o-q) and CCR (3.3% q-o-q).Developers are observed to be beginning to be more aggressive to replenish their land inventory. This came on the back of unsold inventory declining to 26,483 units in Q3 2020 since its last peak in 2018, coupled with the limited injection of land though government land sales. Hence, collective sales and private land sales gained traction this quarter. In addition, the tenders at Tanah Merah KechilLink and Yishun Ave 9 GLS sites, which closed in Oct 2020, were also highly contested.According to preliminary estimates, take-up for new home sales for 2020 reached 9,889 units while the overall private home prices increased by 2.2% for the full year. Moving forward, market performance is likely to be positive, driven by optimism surrounding the nationwide vaccine rollout, stabilisation of the economy and most importantly, low interest rates.

The performance of key industrial indicators was a mixed bag -manufacturing output rose by 17.9% y-o-y in Nov, reversing its surprise fall of 0.8% y-o-y in Oct; whereas NODX sustained its decline from the previous month in Nov by 4.9% y-o-y. Meanwhile, PMI posted its sixth consecutive month of expansion in Dec at 50.5.Leasing activity in Q4 2020 saw an uptick from the preceding quarter, on the back of improved global demand for pharmaceuticals and electronics. Majority of transactions conducted this quarter comprised renewals and relocations, with only a handful of new set ups and expansions. In particular, warehouse leasing demand was propped up by third-party logistics and e-commerce players. While prime logistics vacancy remained compressed in Q4 2020, it is likely to begin increasing around mid-2021 with some pockets of space slated to be released.The healthy warehouse leasing demand contributed to an increase in rents in Q4 2020, bringing them back to pre-COVID-19 levels on a y-o-y basis. On the other hand, the factory market remains two-tiered, with older stock counterbalancing the demand for high-specs factory spaces. As such, factory rents stayed flat q-o-q, with full-year contraction coming in at 4.2%. Looking ahead, with construction delays pushing back the completion dateline for a significant portion of 2020's pipeline, CBRE Research expects some of the supply to begin materialising towards mid-2021, barring any unforeseen circumstances. On the demand side, the government has been spearheading efforts to have sufficient vaccines for the entire population by Q3 2021 as well as aiming to be the vaccine distribution hub for the region. As such, specialised cold chain is poised to drive logistics demand in the coming year to handle the incoming vaccine shipments.

Manufacturing had been the most resilient sector in 2020, growing 7.3% YOY despite the pandemic, while construction and services contracted 35.9% YOY and 6.9% YOY respectively. In Q4 2020, GDP growth contracted 2.4% YOY but grew a seasonally adjusted 3.8% QOQ, once again driven by the manufacturing sector, which expanded 10.3% YOY. Going forward, manufacturing could be supported by robust semiconductor demand from the 5G and automotive markets. The IT services sector could benefit from firms' continued demand for IT and digital solutions. According to Colliers' research, average monthly industrial gross rents fell by 0.6% HOH in Q4 2020 as Covid-19 continued to dampen business sentiment and leasing activities. For the full year, factory rents declined the most at 1.9% YOY, while business parks and high-spec buildings have been the most resilient (-1.0% YOY and -0.9% YOY respectively). Rents of warehouse- logistics space were down 0.6% HOH and 1.2% YOY in Q4 2020 to SGD1.22 (USD0.92) per sq foot, despite higher take-up as landlords prioritised occupancy over rents. Based on data from JTC, all-industrial occupancy increased by 0.7ppt to 89.9% in 2020 (+0.5 ppt HOH in H2 2020), as warehouse occupancy rose 1.9ppt to 89.9%. Barring further construction disruptions, supply in 2021 looks abundant at 24.5 million sq feet (2.3 million sq metres), 76% of which is factory space. This is equivalent to 1.8x the 10-year historical average as factory supply is scheduled to increase 6.4x YOY. As such, we expect all- industrial vacancy to rise 1.7 ppt to 11.8% by end of 2021, while rents for factories remain flat. Recovery expected in 2021 In 2021, we expect a recovery in most industrial segments along with the overall economic rebound, with Oxford Economics forecasting a GDP growth of 5.6% in 2021. We forecast continued and growing demand for warehouse space to drive a 1.3% YOY rental growth, the highest among all segments, led by ramp-up logistics space. Factory rents, on the contrary, should stay flat in 2021, before recovering in 2022, as ample supply suppresses rental growth. We expect rents of business parks and hi-specs space to grow 1%, supported by the thriving technology sector.

This brings the full year price decline to 2.7% YOY, dragged by multi- user factories, reflecting the weaker factory rents. Notably, the number of transactions recovered to normalised levels in H2 2020 from abysmal levels in H1 2020 due to lock-downs. In H2 2020, the number of transactions for factory units increased 1.4x HOH to 792 (2015-2019 5-year semi-annual average 553), while that of warehouse units jumped 3.2x HOH to 54 (5-year semi-annual average 34), reflecting some pent-up demand.

The near-halving of total investment sales in 2020 was a likely by-product of the COVID-19 situation, which resulted in reduced activities in the construction sector as well as the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. The public investment sales market saw the award of a single site at $0.62bn for a Residential with Commercial at 1st Storey development in 4Q 2020.

The majority stake of the new development will be held by Perennial with the remaining stake shared by other investors such as HPRY Holding, which is the investment vehicle of Perennial. * For retail investment sales, there was just one significant transaction for 4Q 2020: FCT's divestment of Anchorpoint shopping centre for $110mn to unrelated parties. The shopping centre has around 50 tenants spread over close to 7,000sqm of NLA. * For residential investment sales, the sole significant transaction of 4Q 2020 came from Mediacorp's sale of the site occupied by the former Caldecott Broadcast Centre for $280.9mn (Figure 2). It will explore redevelopment options for the site that was previously granted an Outline Approval to be redeveloped into a cluster of 2-storey bungalows with a minimum land area of 800sqm per house. Apart from the Caldecott site, there were 13 other landed residential transactions greater than $20mn each in 4Q 2020. The decline in transaction activity in 4Q 2020 showed the uncertainties given the ongoing weakness in the economy. However, according to the Singapore Commercial Credit Bureau's Business Optimism Index, business optimism improved for the second consecutive quarter to -1.03 percentage points in 1Q 2021 from -4.97 percentage points in 4Q 2020. As the economy resumes greater normalcy, the financial, manufacturing and service sectors anticipated a slightly better outlook in 1Q 2021.

The islandwide occupancy rate inched up slightly by 0.2% pts qoq to 88.2% in 4Q 2020 (Figure 3). The demand in office spaces can be attributed to the technology sector due to the conducive business environment in Singapore. The occupancy rate in CBD rebounded by 1.1% pts qoq to 93.1% in 4Q 2020. * The technology and financial sectors were some of the sectors that supported demand in 4Q 2020 (Table 5).

Within the CBD, premium grade buildings in Shenton Way/Robinson Road/Tanjong Pagar ungraded rents at Shenton Way/Robinson Road/ Tanjong Pagar faced the greatest pressures and decline by 1.5% qoq.

Most of the office developments will be completed in 2021 (28.03% or 1.36mn sq ft) and 2024 (28.05% or 1.4mn sq ft). Close to half (47.2%) of the supply pipeline from 2021 (28% or 1.4mn sq ft) to 2024 will be in the CBD, followed by 32.2% in Decentralised Areas. In the CBD, Afro-Asia I-Mark is estimated to complete by end 2021 and currently has a 70% pre-commitment rate, with Delivery Hero, The Great Room and Foodpanda leasing space. Outlook The office market outlook should gradually improve with the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines. Trends which are underway such as the proliferation of working from home arrangements that started since the Circuit Breaker period may also further encourage the decentralisation trend. With the recent announcement of Google co-founder Sergey Brin opening a family office in Singapore, this signals investors' continuous confidence of Singapore as a financial hub. We expect that co-working space will continue to be favoured, even amid the pandemic, as it provides companies with the flexibility to amend their workspace needs and not be tied down to long-term leases. 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2021 2022 2023 2024 Under Construction Planned mn sq ft Source: EDMUND TIE Research Figure 4: Office development pipeline 6 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL Market commentary Key indicators The manufacturing PMI reading increased by 0.2 points from December 2020 to 50.7 in January 2021 (Table 7). This was the third month of expansion for the overall manufacturing sector, signalling the possibility of a recovery. NODX dropped by -0.5% yoy in 4Q 2020. The decline was mainly driven by the non-electronics sectors such as non-monetary gold, pharmaceuticals, and petrochemicals. Demand and occupancy * Based on JTC's statistics, overall industrial net absorption increased from 1.2mn sq ft in 3Q 2020 to 2.3mn sq ft in 4Q 2020. The full year absorption declined from 7.9mn sq ft in 2019 to 7.5mn sq ft in 2020 (-4.0%). In 4Q 2020, occupancy rates of single-user factory space, multiuser factory space, and business park and warehouse space increased (Figure 5). * Demand for warehouses is projected to be supported by the rise of e-commerce amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as more logistics facilities and fulfilment centres are required to meet the demand for faster deliveries, higher efficiency and lower costs.

Approximately 53% of the pipeline will be completed in 2021, followed by 30.7% in 2022 (12.8mn sq ft). Multi-user factories accounted for the bulk (33%) of the supply pipeline (Figure 6). The larger multi-user factory developments in the pipeline are Solaris @ Tai Seng (929,000 sq ft) and Mapletree Industrial Trust located at Kallang Way (710,000 sq ft).

The capacity limit had increased from 10 sqm per person to 8 sqm per person. However, overall retail sales are not back to pre-Covid-19 levels yet. * With the rise in e-commerce, brick and mortal retailers are jumping on to the bandwagon of online shops. CapitaLand and Shopee will debut Singapore's first virtual shopping centre, IMM mall, featuring popular retailers and discounts for shoppers to enjoy. Additionally, retailers who participate in the campaign will receive subsidies and marketing channels for their products. * Retailers are finding new ways to attract consumers. Example, Zall Bookstore from Hubei, China opened its first outlet here located at Wheelock place. The 2-storey space features a cafe and an art gallery. * The 3-month moving average of yoy change in retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) improved slightly to -5.7% in December 2020 from -9.5% in September 2020 (Figure 7). While retail sales continued to fall, the decline has been more moderated, implying a stabilisation in retail sales since the reopening of Singapore's economy. * For 2020, supermarkets & hypermarkets reported the greatest growth in sales of 31.0% (Figure 8). However, department stores sales declined the most by 41.0%. Apart from cautious spending by consumers, the large decrease can also be attributed to more people purchasing goods online instead.

The bulk of the supply pipeline is expected to be completed in 2021 (39.0%) and 2023 (39.0%) (Figure 11). The majority (87.0%) of the supply pipeline will emerge from the Fringe/Suburban Areas. Outlook With the COVID-19 pandemic, many retailers were forced to shutter their outlets in 2020, reflecting the challenges in the retail industry. Traditional brick and mortar retailers are moving towards online sales with more consumers opting for delivery services rather than patronising retailer stores. Moving forward into 2021, retailers could face better prospects when consumers are more confident in terms of their income and in the recovery of Singapore economy. The trend of experiential retail is being accelerated, as retailers find ways to attract consumers to continue patronising their stores. Additionally, businesses can also reassess their digital strategies and adopt sound multi- channel strategies to connect their physical stores and e-commerce presence. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 2021 2022 2023 2024 Orchard/ Scotts Road Other City Areas Fringe/Suburban Areas '000 sq ft Source: EDMUND TIE Research Figure 11: Retail development pipeline 11 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH RESIDENTIAL Market commentary Key indicators * According to the URA All Residential Property Price Index (PPI), overall private home prices rose for the third consecutive quarter in 4Q 2020, rising by 2.1% qoq.

Around 47.7% of the supply pipeline (25,011 units) have been sold, while the remaining 27,392 units are still unsold. Outlook * Despite the plunge in property demand in 1H 2020, housing demand picked up in 2H 2020 with healthy sales for both landed and non-landed segments. Notwithstanding the new policy relating to OTP re-issuance by the URA, homebuyers will adapt to the new policy and manage their finances. Homebuyers who are in a better financial position will be driving the demand * The number of flats reaching five-year MOP is expected to rise. Coupled with the low interest rate environment, this is expected to support residential demand. Market sentiment will continue to be optimistic for both domestic and international investors with the nation accelerating the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine.

THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET PULLED THROUGH A COVID-19 YEAR RELATIVELY UNSCATHED TAN B O O N LEONG, E X E C U T I V E D I R E CTO R , I N D U ST R I A L , CAPITAL MARKETS Based on advance estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the Singapore economy contracted by a lesser 3.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the fourth quarter when compared to Q2 and Q3 2020. This brings the total decline in the overall gross domestic product (GDP) for the year 2020 to 5.8%. The improved performance in Q4 2020 was led by the manufacturing sector which grew by 9.5% y-o-y, primarily driven by output expansions in the electronics, biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering clusters, offsetting declines in the transport engineering and general manufacturing clusters. The Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reported continued expansions in Q4 2020, with the latest month of December tracking an expansion of 50.5. Simultaneously, the Electronics Sector PMI for the same month registered a reading of 51.2, the highest since September 2018. The continued adoption of the 5G network as well as other high- end electronic parts and components are expected to fuel the demand for electronics. Together with the news of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and improved sentiment, economic recovery remains on track in 2021. In light of global food supply uncertainties brought about by the pandemic, there were more initiatives to support the agri-food industry in Singapore in order to create some level of self-sufficiency. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) introduced the \"30x30 Express\" From Q4 2020 to 2024, some 53.8 million sq ft gross floor area (GFA) of industrial space is slated to be completed. Of these, about 43.2% of the upcoming supply is expected to be completed in 2021, with a significant proportion being multiple-user and single-user factory spaces. Coupled with the phased withdrawal of government fiscal support for businesses, multiple- user factory prices and rents are likely to come under pressure, falling by not more than 5% in 2021 while single-user factories could fare slightly better. However, with the anticipated distribu- tion of viable COVID-19 vaccines, the city-state's strategic location and devel- oped IT infrastructure would position 1The percentage changes for the total number of tenancies of multiple-user factory space in October and November 2020 are based on a two-month comparison q-o-q (against July and August 2020) and y-o-y (against October and November 2019). The median rent for multiple-user factory spaces island-wide in the fourth quarter stood at S$1.73 per-square-foot per month (psf pm), declining 3.1% quarter-on- quarter (q-o-q) and by a more marginal 0.9% y-o-y (Exhibit 1). The leasing volume of 1,562 transactions (S$6.2 million) for such industrial space in October and November represented an increase of 16.8% from 1,337 transactions in the same period last year, as activity returned to this market segment despite the current external headwinds. Prices of multiple-user factory space were fairly steady in the fourth quarter, averaging about S$357 psf, representing a decrease of 3.8% y-o-y. Units with 61 to 99 years left in the lease registered the largest growth of 19.0% y-o-y to average S$379 psf in Q4 2020, with demand for these spaces fuelled by the comparatively lower availability of multiple-user factory units with longer tenures (Exhibit 2).

This move to encourage more indoor farming requiring less space to grow crops as well as to ensure food security would generate additional demand for suitable industrial properties that can provide the facilities to support high- rise vertical farming and high-density agricultural production through new technologies.

SINGAPORE VIEW 22ND EDITION Singapore as a key warehousing and storage hub, and logistics properties are expected to benefit with price and rent increases ranging from 1% to 3% in 2021. Especially so, for cold-storage facilities that cater to the requirements of housing the temperature-controlled vaccine. While business sentiment has improved with the release of the vaccine, cautious optimism remains and Singapore needs to be prepared for possible recurring infections. Therefore, the production of hygiene- or health-related products such as hand sanitisers, masks as well as gloves remains necessary, maintaining the demand for industrial spaces geared towards the production and stockpiling of these essentials.

However, that of standard business parks fell for a third consecutive quarter by 1% to S$4.01 per sq ft as landlords are required to be more realistic with their rental expectations to maintain occupancy. * After two quarters of decline, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket rose by 0.9% QoQ to S$3.50 per sq ft in Q4. * In 2021, the rental forecast for multiple-user factories is expected to be between -3% and 0% while that for warehouses is projected to increase by between 1% and 3%. Multiple-user factories are faced with a surge in the pipeline supply in the near term as the backlog from 2020 (due to construction delays) gets completed. On the other hand, the growth in warehouse rents continues to be supported by the logistics sector.

This was largely attributed to the 10.3% YoY expansion in the manufacturing sector, extending the 11% growth in Q3. The growth was led by output expansion in the electronics, biomedical manufacturing, precision engineering and chemicals cluster. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic still took a toll with Singapore's economy contracting by 5.4% in 2020, a reversal from the 1.3% expansion in 2019. However, the manufacturing sector posted growth of 7.3%, in contrast to the 1.5% contraction in 2019. This was supported by expansion in the biomedical manufacturing, electronics and precision engineering clusters, arising from strong demand for pharmaceutical products, semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment respectively. With the pickup in manufacturing demand following the reopening of the economy, the manufacturing sector ended on a positive note in 2020. In December, the overall Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) remained in expansionary mode for a sixth straight month. Similarly, manufacturing output grew by 14.3% YoY in December, bringing overall growth to 7.3% in 2020. The expansion in December was supported by the electronics, chemicals and precision engineering. On the other hand, after an increase of 6.5% in Q3/2020, non-oil domestic exports (NODX) recorded a 0.5% YoY decline in Q4/2020. Nevertheless, NODX expanded by 4.3% in 2020, a reversal from the 9.2% drop in 2019. Despite global economic uncertainties, the overall growth in 2020 was led by increased shipments of electronics and non-electronics products. RENTAL MARKET Following the spike in industrial leasing activity in Q3/2020, the momentum continued into Q4/2020, with leasing volume1 increasing by 17.2% YoY to 2,913 transactions. For the whole of 2020, despite the pandemic, leasing transactions expanded by 2.3% to 10,705 transactions. While leasing volume in warehouses fell by 1.4%, it was outweighed by increases in leasing transactions of both single-user and multiple-user factories. For multiple-user factories, the higher rental volume may be attributed to higher supply of such properties. Nevertheless, in general, leasing demand largely emanated from e-commerce (including e-sports), central kitchens and precision manufacturing, which have been the trending sectors since the pandemic begun. The overall industrial vacancy rate eased further in Q4, decreasing by 0.3 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ and 0.7 of a ppt YoY to 10.1%. This is the lowest level 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). recorded since Q1/2016 when the vacancy rate was 9.9%. The decrease in vacancy rate can be attributed to resilient demand for industrial space amid limited new supply arising from construction delays due to the pandemic. Among the property types, the largest YoY drop in vacancy rate was most evident in warehouse (-1.9 ppts), followed by multiple-user factory (-1.0 ppt). The stable occupancy rate for both property types can be attributed to the proliferation of e-commerce companies, remote working and rising demand for semiconductors due to the roll-out of 5G. JTC's rental indices inched up marginally by 0.1% QoQ in Q4/2020, but on a YoY basis, it fell 1.5%. For Savills' basket of industrial properties, the average monthly rent for prime multiple-user factories2 declined for the fi fth consecutive quarter by 0.9% to S$1.70 per sq ft. On the other hand, the average monthly rent for prime warehouse and logistics3 properties continued growing, rising by 1.1% QoQ to S$1.43 per sq ft in Q4 after a 0.9% increase in Q3. This was due to sustained demand for last-mile delivery facilities which corresponded with the boom in e-commerce and also stockpiling needs as companies build buff er against disruptions. Additionally, as more COVID-19 vaccines arrive in Singapore, they add an additional source of demand for storage space. Cold store logistics warehouses are therefore expected to be sought after, supporting rental growth. SALES MARKET In the strata sales market, following a spike in strata sales volume in Q3/2020, strata sales inched up marginally by 0.8% QoQ to 369 in the fi nal quarter of 2020. Despite the increase in sales volume for 2H/2020, it was insuffi cient to outweigh the decline in sales volume for 1H, leading to a 2.2% YoY fall in 2020. This was the fi rst decrease after two consecutive years of growth. While strata sales volume of multiple-user factories and warehouses contracted, strata sales of single- user factories grew on a YoY basis. The resilient demand for industrial space in Q4/2020 was refl ected in the JTC price index which showed that overall industrial prices rose by 1.0% QoQ. This was a turnaround after four consecutive quarters of decline. However, on a YoY basis, prices are still down by 2.7% in 2020, a larger drop than the 0.3% fall in 2019.

On the other hand, due to limited supply, prices of freehold industrial properties remained strong, rising for a fi fth consecutive quarter with an increase of 0.8% QoQ in Q4/2020 to S$700 per sq ft. The lower supply also resulted in reduced transaction volumes. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL SPACE Net demand improved in Q4/2020 with a rise in demand in the Central Region outweighing the drop in the East Region. This led to the islandwide vacancy declining 0.4 of a ppt QoQ to 14.2% in Q4/2020. However, this was still higher than the 13.8% recorded in Q4/2019. Out of the regions, the vacancy rate in both the Central and West Regions posted QoQ declines of 0.7 of a ppt and 0.2 of a ppt respectively while the East Region grew by 0.4 of a ppt QoQ. The improvement in both the Central and West Regions was seen in the newer business park clusters such as Mapletree Business City, one-north and Cleantech Park, which registered increases in occupancy rates. However, business parks such as International Business Park and Changi Business Park have been aff ected due to their location and age. The business park sector was resilient with limited new supply and demand emanating from the technology, media and telecommunications sector. While the JTC rental index for business parks inched up slightly by 0.1% QoQ in Q4 after two consecutive quarters of decline, the average monthly rent in Savills' basket of prime business park properties5 remained unchanged at S$5.81 per sq ft. On the other hand, the average monthly rent of Savills' basket of standard business park properties6 declined for a third consecutive quarter by 1% QoQ to S$4.01 per sq ft as landlords have been more realistic with their rental expectations in order to maintain occupancy. 5 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 6 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. For high-spec industrial properties, demand remains strong and is expected to stay healthy in line with the thriving technology, biomedical and electronics sectors. After two consecutive quarters of decline, the average monthly rent for Savills' high-spec industrial basket7 grew by 0.9% QoQ to S$3.50 per sq ft in Q4/2020. Demand from these segments remains high as Singapore progresses to higher-value manufacturing. Also, with limited new supply, rents are expected to remain strong. Amongst the range of high-spec buildings, the newer and better-located ones are performing well. To meet the needs of occupiers from emerging and trending industries, landlords are undertaking asset enhancement works. As an example, AEI works are scheduled for 61 and 63 Alexandra Terrace to become a high-spec industrial building, providing a lifestyle and wellness-oriented business environment for users. OUTLOOK At the end of 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its 2021 forecast of global economic growth upwards by 0.3 of a ppt from its previous forecast to 5.5% in 2021. In 2022, the global economy is projected to grow by 4.2%. Similarly, with Singapore's COVID-19 situation largely under control and the vaccination programme currently underway, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects a gradual recovery over the course of 2021, with GDP growth forecast at 4.0% to 6.0%. The manufacturing sector is forecast to grow at an 7 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft.

The importance of the manufacturing sector to Singapore's economy is also evident with the introduction of a new 10-year plan which aims to expand the sector by 50% and maintain its share of around 20% of GDP. As such, instead of lowering production or labour costs, the manufacturing sector must hone its competitiveness through innovation and the production of higher-value products, hence the need to focus on sub-sectors such as advanced manufacturing. As construction work resumes, there will likely be a surge in pipeline supply in the near term as the backlog from 2020 gradually gets completed. While demand drivers such as e-commerce and logistics are expected to continue trending, it is yet to be seen whether demand for space from these sectors will be suffi cient to absorb upcoming completions. Despite some positive economic sentiment alongside hopes of containing the pandemic, uncertainties persist and industrialists are expected to remain cautious with their spatial needs as Singapore is very dependent on international trade. Hence, rental growth is expected to remain depressed, particularly for factories. For warehouses, apart from increasing demand from e-commerce and stockpiling needs, cold chain logistics may become another demand driver as Singapore aims to become a COVID-19 vaccine distribution hub for the region.

On a positive note, the electronics PMI rose by 1.4 to 50.6 in the same month, the highest reading since September 2018. Business Park and Logistics Segments Doing Well Business park space is still in demand by firms seeking cost-effective space for their workforce. Kajima Corporation started construction of its first overseas innovation centre at Changi Business Park. Kajima will be investing $100 million in the property, which will span around 141,000 sf of business park space and R&D lab space. Upon its completion in 2023, Kajima Global Hub will serve as the firm's regional headquarters and conduct research and development into advanced building technologies for the construction industry. The logistics sector continues to see expansion. German logistics firm DB Schenker recently opened its 550,000 sf warehouse at Airport Logistics Park. The firm invested $163 million in the property, which increased its number of warehouses in Singapore to 13 and its total warehouse footprint to 2.8 million sf. Automation technologies used in the facility will result in a 40% speed increase in the handling of air freight imports and exports, which will enable DB Schenker to handle high order volumes. In addition, the facility will have sustainable features such as photo-voltaic solar panels which will reduce energy use by around 35%. Mixed Outlook for Industrial Rents The outlook for industrial rents is mixed depending on the segment. Rents for business parks in the city fringe are projected to do well as demand remains sustained by firms seeking to cut their real estate costs by relocating to business park spaces in the city fringe which have similar specifications to Grade A office space. Science Park rents are also expected to increase slightly due to the growth of the pharmaceutical and biomedical sector. However, rents for business parks in the outlying areas will decline due to the older stock in these areas. Factory rents are likely to moderate as global demand has yet to recover, while high-tech rents may remain stable due to the growth of the electronics sector. Rents of the prime logistics segment are expected to increase due to the strong preference for ramp-up facilities, while those of conventional warehouses could remain flat.

This marks the first increase after three consecutive quarters of decline in investment volume. OFFICEThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to pile pressure on the economic performance of Singapore. Coupled with the bleak employment outlook, office demand continued to dampen. BUSINESS PARKSOverall demand in the business park market was relatively subdued in Q3 2020 as illustrated by the islandwidenet absorption of a mere 15,960 sq. ft. in Q3 2020. RETAILRental correction accelerated, as rental rebates passed down from the government have mostly expired by the end of Q3 2020. RESIDENTIALThe residential market continued to surprise on the upside despite the economy undergoing a recession from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Additional Support Measures Extended support measures for SMEs A Timeline of Events in 2020 Q3 2020 CBRE Research MARKETVIEWAlong with the lifting of some COVID-19 restrictions, real estate investment volume in Singapore for Q3 2020 came to $2.789 bn, a 23.2% increase from the previous quarter. This marks the first increase after three consecutive quarters of decline in investment volume.The residential sector was the outperformer, coming in at 33.5% of investment sales, due to strong sales of good class bungalows and detached houses. The office sector also came in strongly with two major deals propping up volume: the sale of Robinson Point for $500.00 mil and ABI Plaza for $200.00 mil.Retail sales also came in higher at $672.00 mil, or 1.85 times q-o-q, due to the sale of the south wing of Northpoint City for $550.00 million. Despite the absence of public land sales, industrial volume remained robust coming in at $396.60 mil, an increase of 26.2% q-o-q, with several sales to end-users and a data centredeal.Prices have declined slightly due to the poorer rental and occupancy outlook. However, prices remain supported by the limited supply of prime assets and holding power of asset owners.Buyers have been very selective with the market in a stalemate; several tenders have closed without bids. Nevertheless, investors are still looking out for office assets, while watching closely for signs of distress in the retail and hospitality sectors. Foreign investment volume dropped by 26.4% q-o-q due to travel restrictions. Going forward, market activity is likely to be dominated by local players.The shrinking universe of investible assets in Singapore may lead to fewer transactions crossing the billion-dollar mark, but this will also continue to drive interest in niche asset classes such as shophouses and value-add opportunities. Nonetheless, the retail sector is getting a respite from the resurgence of food & beverage, residential sales are supported by pent-up demand, while industrial assets are riding on the e-commerce wave. For the office sector, news of Chinese tech firms coming to Singapore have provided a silver lining. As such, the current situation could present opportunities for investors with a longer-term view.

Coupled with the bleak employment outlook, office demand continued to dampen. Islandwidenet absorption registered -445,491 sq. ft., which was the second consecutive quarter of negative net absorption.Cost efficiency continued to be the main driver for leasing enquiries. In Q3 2020, the sectors that contributed to occupier activity were the insurance and technology sectors. However, challenges in most sectors have reduced the volume of occupied space by firms. This resulted in an emerging volume of secondary space which will raise the spectre of competition for tenants. Nonetheless, the quality, fitted-out secondary space in prime locations are poised to attract tenants seeking to relocate.In Q3 2020, Shaw Towers was removed from stock as it commenced construction works. With no new supply over the past three months, the negative net absorption resulted in a marginal increase in the islandwidevacancy rate from 5.6% in Q2 2020 to 5.9% in Q3 2020. With vacancy rates expected to rise, landlords are realigning rental expectations, and thus narrowing the rental expectations gap between tenants and landlords. However, the rate of rental decline was cushioned by the stimulus packages and rental relief schemes. In Q3 2020, Grade A (Core CBD) office rents declined for its third consecutive quarter at 4.0% q-o-q to $10.70 psf/month. In the short term, occupier movement is likely to stem from the displacement of tenants from upcoming redevelopment projects. Furthermore, Chinese technology firms and family offices are establishing offices here, which reinforces Singapore's status as a financial and technology hub. On the supply side, concerns around the next wave in 2022 have dissipated as the expected completion of upcoming developments are delayed by at least three months. This will allow supply and demand dynamics to recalibrate.

Overall demand in the business park market was relatively subdued in Q3 2020 as illustrated by the islandwidenet absorption of a mere 15,960 sq. ft. in Q3 2020. Occupier activity was relatively muted, with some leasing demand from the technology sector. Renewals were a prominent feature and some large occupiers were cutting back on requirements. At the same time, the stringent qualifying requirements for business park space served as a high barrier to entry for tenants. With no new supply over the past three months, islandwidevacancy eased slightly from 13.1% in Q2 2020 to 13.0% in Q3 2020. The rental disparity between both submarkets has led cost conscious occupiers to consider the Rest of Island submarket. At the same time, with limited availability of large contiguous space in the newer buildings within the City Fringe submarket, occupancy is unlikely to dip significantly.On the back of lacklustre demand and rising vacancy in the older buildings, some landlords are adjusting their rental expectations. The rents in the City Fringe submarket eased 0.9% q-o-q to $5.80 psf/month, and the Rest of Island submarket declined 1.3% q-o-q to $3.70 psf/month. The disruptions in the construction industry resulted in construction delays of ongoing business park projects. This has pushed back the expected completion of projects by at least three months. From Q4 2020 to 2023, 4.41 mil of future supply is expected to come on stream, with an estimated 31.5% of this upcoming supply pre-committed by end-users.Looking ahead, more downsizing could be seen in the horizon as tenants recalibrate their footprint. Nonetheless, business parks still feature prominently in the long-term plan for firms. The City Fringe business parks continue to attract interest despite its tight supply and rental premium over Rest of Island business parks.

While sentiments have improved, the retail market continues to be affected by the absence of international tourists and work from home measures. Consolidation activity increased from poorer performing stores as businesses are unable to sustain current rental and labour costs in this challenging climate. For example, retailers such as Naiiseand Charles & Keith have downsized their store footprint to enhance business efficiency while Topshopand Hotwindexited the Singapore market entirely.Landlords have become more realistic in their rental expectations as they attempt to strike a balance between rental and occupancy. In addition, some landlords are undertaking more flexible leasing terms given the fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic. These include shorter lease terms, longer rent-free periods and changing of rental structure. Rental correction accelerated, as rental rebates passed down from the government have mostly expired by the end of Q3 2020. Average prime islandwide retail rents reported a steeper decline of 3.1% q-o-q in Q3 2020, after -1.8% q-o-q in Q2 2020. Submarkets which have a higher reliance on tourist and office footfall suffered higher degrees of stress. This is with the exception of the suburban market, where shopper traffic has recovered strongly. Given the resilient nature of the suburban market, the premium between prime suburban and Orchard Road has decreased to an all time low of 3.5%.To date, rental correction has not been as severe due to tenant support and government measures which have cushioned the negative impact. Although shopper traffic has improved, the sector is still plagued by uncertainty over the recovery of the tourism industry, lifting of safety management measures and prolonged disruptions from the global pandemic. Occupancy and rents are expected to remain under pressure, although the extent will be mitigated by the limited new retail supply. 6 SINGAPORE RETAIL Chart 7: Retail Economic Indicators Source: STB, MTI Economic Survey of Singapore, CBRE Research, Q3 2020 Table 6: Estimated Gross New Supply* Source: CBRE Research, Q3 2020 *excludes projects with a NLA of less than 20,000 sq. ft.

A total of 3,564 caveats were lodged for new private residential homes in Q3 2020, a 4.8% y-o-y increase, attributed to healthy take-up from new launches. Prices exhibited a similar trend as flash estimates of Q3 2020 private residential property price index increased 0.8% q-o-q, following the pick-up of 0.3% q-o-q in Q2 2020. Buyers for new homes were in favour of larger units, considering that the median unit sizes increased from 721 sq. ft. in Q2 2020 to 753 sq. ft. in Q3 2020.New sales volume (non-landed) in the RCR accounted for 52.6% of all new sale transactions in Q3 2020, supported by new launches such as Forettat Bukit Timahand Penrose. These projects secured take-up rates of 39% and 64% which are considered healthy given today's challenging macro-environment. Key contributing factors included pent-up demand, low interest rates, as well as the holding power of buyers strengthened by the economic support measures which has helped cushioned the recessionary impact and job losses. Given the robust market activity, unsold inventory is expected to decline further, from 27,977 units in Q2 2020.Year to date, take-up for new home for 2020 reached 7,426 units while the overall private home prices increased by 0.1%. CBRE Research has revised its forecast for new home sales in 2020 to about 9,000 units, given the possibility of sales momentum from a healthy project pipeline scheduled for Q4 2020. On the other hand, there could be a minor correction towards the end of the year, especially if developers adopt a more flexible pricing strategy to move units.That said, the URA recently unveiled new guidelines stating that developers can no longer re-issue the option to purchase (OTP) to the same buyer multiple times. This may cause a slight dampener to future sales numbers, particularly for uncertain buyers who are unable to commit during this period.

Nonetheless, positive blips were observed across industrial indicators -manufacturing output rose by 13.7% y-o-y in August following three consecutive months of contraction, while NODX expanded for the third consecutive month in the same month by 7.7% y-o-y. Sentiments similarly improved, as PMI recorded its first expansion since January at 50.2 in July and sustained its expansion in August and September at 50.1 and 50.3 respectively. Leasing activity in the quarter consisted mainly of renewals and relocations. While government stockpiling eased off, leasing demand was stable for warehouse and prime logistics spaces, supported by e-commerce, food logistics and third-party logistics players. Prime logistics vacancy remained compressed, with most buildings nearing full occupancy. In addition, there were some leasing enquiries for factory spaces with higher specifications. Meanwhile, some non-renewals by master lessees were reported by landlords, including SabanaREIT and A-REIT, for both factory and warehouse properties.The resilient leasing demand for logistics spaces lent support to rents, with both ground and upper floor warehouse rents increasing by 0.5% q-o-q in Q3 2020. On the other hand, the demand for factory buildings with higher specifications was balanced out by the lack thereof for older non-high-specs stock. As such, both ground and upper floor factory rents stayed flat in the same quarter. Notably, there was a decrease in the supply pipeline for the rest of the year, due to construction delays vis-a-vis the pandemic. Consequently, most factory and warehouse completions have been pushed back by three to six months, and further delays could be expected moving forward.

The two quarters marked the steepest declines in the post Global Financial Crisis period (Table 1). On a quarter-on-quarter (qoq) basis, the Singapore economy expanded by 7.9% in 3Q 2020, an improvement from the decline of 13.2% in 2Q 2020. * As Singapore moved into Phase 2 of its recovery from 19 June 2020, the majority of industries, except for the entertainment sector, had restarted operations. The manufacturing industry recorded a 2.0% yoy growth in 3Q 2020, a rebound as compared to -0.8% yoy in 2Q 2020. The construction and services producing industries also moderated to -44.7% and -8.0% yoy in 3Q 2020 respectively as compared to that in 2Q 2020. * Given the earlier economic contraction, inflationary pressures have eased while labour market pressures rose. Inflation declined by 0.5% in 2Q 2020, extending from the -0.1% in 1Q 2020. The unemployment rate also increased to 2.9% in 2Q 2020, from 2.4% in 1Q 2020 (Table 2).

As a result, investment sales grew by 33.8% qoq to nearly $2.5bn in 3Q 2020 after three consecutive quarters of decline (Figure 1). There were no significant GLS sites being awarded in 3Q 2020, resulting in no public investment sales for the second consecutive quarter.

Table 3: Investment sales summary* Source: Various sources, EDMUND TIE Research all from the office sector, the major transactions in 3Q 2020 were from various property sectors, with three from the industrial sector (Table 3). The buoyant demand for industrial and logistics assets arose from rising warehousing needs during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. * Refers to any property transactions with value above S$10mn. 3 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Sector trends and outlook * After two consecutive quarters of increase, office investment sales declined by 46.3% qoq to $711mn in 3Q 2020 due to lower investment activity in the sector. Two office buildings and one strata office unit were sold in the quarter. The largest deal in 3Q 2020 was the sale of Robinson Point for $500mn ($3,721 psf NLA) from Tuan Sing Holdings to a British Virgin Islands-incorporated investment holding company (Table 4). The office building was previously acquired by Tuan Sing in 2013 for $348.9mn and has undergone asset enhancement works to the main lobby, carpark lobby and loading bays. In 3Q 2020, ABI Plaza was also sold to a private fund managed by CapitaLand Fund Management for $200mn ($2,162 psf NLA) after it was put on the market by MYP since June 2020 at a guide price of above $280mn. The ABI Plaza site will benefit from the grant of bonus GFA under URA's CBD Incentive Scheme upon redevelopment into a mixed- use project. * On the other hand, industrial investment sales more than doubled to $397mn in 3Q 2020 despite lower transaction volume as the price quantums of the transactions were significantly larger. Three of the four investment sales in 3Q 2020 were more than $100mn, with the largest being a ramp-up logistics warehouse at 7 Bulim Street for $129.6mn ($353 psf land area) purchased by AIMS Apac Reit. With an existing master lease, a net property income yield of nearly 7% is expected to be obtained, which is deemed to be rather attractive. The sale of 26A Ayer Rajah Crescent followed closely behind; the property was sold to Equinix by Mapletree Industrial Trust for $125mn. A seven-storey build-to-suit data centre for Equinix is situated at the site. Another significant transaction was the acquisition of the freehold Thye Hong Centre at 2 Leng Kee Road for $112.5mn by SLB Development. The industrial sector has been proven to be resilient amid the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly with data centres and warehouses being sought after. * Retail investment sales increased the most among the property sectors in 3Q 2020, recording $550mn from $43mn in 2Q 2020. There was only one (related party) transaction in 3Q 2020, which was the sale of a 50% stake in Northpoint City (South Wing) based on the property valuation of $1.1bn. Frasers Property sold 50% of its stake in the shopping mall to a division of TCC Group, whose controlling shareholders are that of Frasers Property.

Investment sales almost tripled qoq to $778mn after three consecutive quarters of decline. This was supported by the resumption of home viewings from 19 June 2020. While there were only two Good Class Bungalows (GCBs) sold in 2Q 2020, eight GCBs were sold in 3Q 2020. The largest GCB deal was a GCB on 101,550 sq ft of freehold land in Garlick Avenue for around $93mn ($916 psf land area). The site, which is reported to be purchased by Mr Goh Cheng Liang, founder of Wuthelam Holdings, is large enough to be subdivided for redevelopment into 5/6 bungalows. Apart from an active GCB market, the collective sales market also saw modest activity. After the en bloc sale of Casa Sophia in 1Q 2020, 3Q 2020 saw the second en bloc sale in 2020 with the sale of Yuen Sing Mansion for $15.2mn, lower than the reserve price of $17mn. This followed its last unsuccessful tender in 2018. Separately, a four-storey residential mixed use building at 320 Balestier Road was sold in 3Q 2020 for $18.1mn to LHN Limited, which had intentions to operate the property as a co-living space. LHN had previously developed Hmlet at Cantonment jointly with Hmlet. Source: EDMUND TIE Research Figure 2: Total investment sales by asset type 72% 14% 9% 3%2% Office Residential Industrial Shophouse Retail The improved transaction activity in 3Q 2020 offered some glimpse of hope for the investment sales market, but there are still uncertainties given ongoing weakness in the economy. Business sentiment among local firms remain pessimistic for 4Q 2020 despite an improvement from 3Q 2020, according to the Singapore Commercial Credit Bureau's Business Optimism Index. However, some sectors such as the professional and IT services, as well as the manufacturing and financial services sectors anticipated a slightly better outlook in 4Q 2020. As Singapore prepares for the next phase of reopening the economy, as well as more green lanes being implemented, this may provide further confidence for foreign investors whose footprints in the market have been on the rise in recent quarters. 3Q 2020 2Q 2020 5 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH OFFICE Office demand and occupancy rates * Based on EDMUND TIE research, net absorption remained in the contractionary zone of -374,000 sq ft in 3Q 2020. The islandwide office occupancy rate contracted by 0.3% points qoq to 92.5% in 3Q 2020 (Figure 3). The decline was largely due to the contraction of office space demand in the CBD, where the occupancy rate declined by 1.1% points to 92.0% in 3Q 2020. The majority of employees continued to work from home as a default in 3Q 2020. * The technology and financial sectors were some of the sectors that supported demand in 3Q 2020 (Table 5). Sun Life has set up a new office in Singapore in One Raffles Quay North Tower. It was also reported that technology and e-commerce giant Amazon had leased around 90,000 sq ft on three levels at Asia Square Tower 1.

Within the CBD, premium grade buildings in Shenton Way/Robinson Road/Tanjong Pagar were generally more resilient as compared to other subzones, recording a 1.5% qoq contraction in 3Q 2020 as the buildings there were newer and had more efficient floor plates. Monthly rents of office buildings in the Decentralised areas held steady in general as rents were already relatively competitive. Supply pipeline Based on EDMUND TIE Research, there is approximately 3.8mn sq ft of new office space estimated to be completed from 3Q 2020 to 2024 (Figure 4). Most of the office developments will be completed in 2022 (49.7% or 1.9mn sq ft). Additionally, more than half of the supply pipeline will be in CBD, followed by 26.9% in CBD fringe. In the CBD, Afro-Asia I-Mark is estimated to complete by end of the 2020 and currently has a 62% pre-commitment rate, with Delivery Hero and The Great Room leasing space. Besides Afro-Asia I-Mark, the additions/alterations to existing HSBC building will complete in 2021, with WeWork taking up the entire office space. 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 3Q-4Q 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Under Construction Planned mn sq ft Source: EDMUND TIE Research Figure 4: Office development pipeline Outlook Looking ahead, we expect a decline in overall office rents for the rest of 2020 and continued weakness in early 2021. Companies are considering a variety of work arrangements in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Demand for office space is still broadly intact though tenants are generally asking for shorter leases. Landlords are likely to be more flexible on lease terms and other fit-out incentives. The growth of technology companies will continue, as businesses are increasingly adopting greater telecommunications tools and improving their processes. In the co-working market, we may see more mergers or consolidation in co-working firms as the market becomes increasingly saturated, especially in the CBD. 7 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH INDUSTRIAL Market commentary Key indicators According to the PMI reading, the manufacturing sector recorded its second month of expansion in August 2020 (Table 7). This was driven by a faster rate of expansion in factory output and an improvement in the new orders index in the PMI index in August 2020. However, the pace of manufacturing expansion was slightly slower in August 2020. Besides the PMI, the NODX performance in August 2020 was driven mainly by the non- electronics sector. Both the PMI and NODX showed an improvement in manufacturing performance, though it has slowed. * There are continued risks arising from geopolitical tensions and anti- globalisation sentiments, such as increased protectionism, which could result in further disruptions to global supply chains. Such risks could adversely impact the overall recovery of the market. * Based on JTC's statistics, overall industrial net absorption expanded from 1.5mn sq ft in 1Q 2020 to 2.2mn sq ft in 2Q 2020. While the occupancy rates of multiple- user factory and business park space contracted qoq in 2Q 2020, the occupancy rates of single-user factory space and warehouse space increased (Figure 5). Key economic indicators 2Q 2020 3Q 2020 Key trends NODX 16.1% 7.7% (Aug 2020) * NODX grew by 7.7% in August 2020, after the 5.9% increase in July 2020. Growth was mainly in non-electronics sectors. PMI* 48.0 50.1 (Aug 2020) * The PMI declined by 0.1 points from 50.2 in July 2020 to 50.1 in August 2020.

All 28 strata units at SLB's MacTaggart Foodlink were reportedly taken up recently. During the Circuit Breaker, F&B operators could only do food delivery or takeout. As a result, some of the big restaurant chains took up industrial space to house a central kitchen or consolidate their outlets. Besides food factories, there was also demand coming from the logistics and warehousing sectors due to the growth in e-commerce. * Notable leases secured in 3Q 2020 included: - Pacific Integrated Logistics, a global logistics provider, which relocated to 8 Tuas South Lane - Royal's Engineering & Trading, a construction industry specialising in plumbing and electrical works, which also relocated to 8 Tuas South Lane 8 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH Industrial type* Subcategory 2Q 2020 3Q 2020 Qoq change (%) Multiple-user factory First-storey 1.84 1.84 0.0 Upper-storey 1.35 1.32 -2.0 Warehouse/logistics Overall 1.58 1.59 0.5 High-tech industrial Overall 2.95 2.92 -1.0 Business park Central Region 4.87 5.00 2.5 Suburban 3.68 3.68 0.0 Table 8: Average monthly gross rents (islandwide) (S$ per sq ft) Source: EDMUND TIE Research * In-house estimates of key selected private industrial premises. Rents * According to EDMUND TIE research, while the monthly average rental rates for upper-storey multiple-user factory and hi-tech industrial properties declined qoq in 3Q 2020, the monthly rents of warehouse/logistics as well as business park (central region) improved (Table 8). * For example, the average monthly rents for warehouse/logistics improved by 0.5% qoq to $1.59 psf in 3Q 2020, on the back of robust demand coming from e-commerce services and stockpiling activities done by supermarkets. Supply pipeline * As at 2Q 2020, the supply pipeline from 3Q 2020 to 2023 is around 40.8mn sq ft or an average of 11.7mn sq ft per annum, which is comparable to the 3-year annual average of 12.0mn. Around 33.8% of the pipeline will be completed between 3Q to 4Q 2020, followed by 27.5% in 2021 (11.2m sq ft). Multiple-user factories accounted for the bulk (34.9%) of the supply pipeline (Figure 6). Solaris @ Tai Seng by SB (Ipark) Investment Pte. Ltd. is the largest multiple-user factory development at 929,000 sq ft.

However, recovery is expected to be different across the various industrial sectors. For instance, rising online and groceries sales will incentivise retailers to stockpile and expand their warehouse facilities to cater to the increasing demand. As demand for industrial properties is also largely dependent on their location and efficiency of their floor plates, industrial developments that are located close to transportation nodes and have efficient floor plates will have greater advantage in attracting tenants. Landlords of older developments could make use of this downtime to upgrade their facilities, so that they can meet with the demand when the market recovers. 9 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH -80% -40% 0% 40% Supermarkets & Hypermarkets Computer & Telecommunications Equipment Furniture & Household Equipment Mini-marts & Convenience Stores Recreational Goods Total (Excluding Motor Vehicles) Others Watches & Jewellery Optical Goods & Books Petrol Service Stations Wearing Apparel & Footwear Cosmetics, Toiletries & Medical Goods Department Stores Food & Alcohol RETAIL Market commentary Key indicators * As Phase 2 of Singapore's reopening begun on 19 June 2020, retail shops started to operate and dine-in activities were allowed. However, overall retail sales are not back to pre-Covid-19 levels yet. * Many retailers have been introducing various promotions to woo shoppers back to malls as it is a challenging period. For instance, the Orchard shopping belt was packed during the National Day weekend, with long queues outside popular stores like Tangs which was offering promotions. * Besides retailers, shopping malls have also begun adopting an online presence. Marina Square collaborated with Lazada as the platform's first shopping mall, working with its tenants to create a virtual mall on the app. Frasers Property Retail is also launching an e-commerce marketplace, Frasers eStore, offering a 'store-to-door experience' for tenants and consumers. * Landlords are also offering spaces to less conventional tenants. For instance, co-working operator JustCo, has taken up space in Cross Street Exchange and Marina Square. In 4Q 2020, JustCo will also be opening another outlet at The Centrepoint. To retain its members, JustCo offered rental rebates of between 15% and 30% for the month of May 2020. * The three-year moving average of retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) growth moderated to -25.4% in July 2020 from the -34.1% in June 2020. (Figure 7). The various promotions introduced by malls and retailers in Phase 2 of Singapore's reopening helped boost retail sales. * In July 2020, the worst performing sectors were food and alcohol as well as departmental stores (Figure 8). On the other hand, supermarkets, computer and telecommunications and the furniture and household equipment sector reported yoy increases in retail sales. Overall, total retail sales (excluding motor vehicles) declined by 7.2% yoy in July 2020. -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 % Source: Department of Statistics Singapore Source: Department of Statistics Singapore Figure 7: Retail sales growth (Three-year moving average) (excluding motor vehicles) Figure 8: Retail sales index (Jul 2020), yoy change 10 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH * The food and beverage index trended downwards by 25.7% yoy in July 2020, and food caterers were the hardest hit, contracting by 45.1% yoy (Figure 9).

Monthly rents of first-storey retail in the Fringe/Suburban areas were supported by the proximity of residential estates in these areas, as people continued to work from home as their default. Additionally, first-storey retail is more well-located and visible as compared to upper-storey retail. All other subzones reported a decline of 2.0% qoq in 3Q 2020 (Table 9).

This is much lower than the three-year annual average supply of 1.0mn sq ft. Most of the supply pipeline (43.0%) is expected to complete by end-2021 (Figure 11). One of the developments that will be completed in 2021 is i12 Katong mall. Outlook Moving forward, we expect the retail market to remain subdued and demand for retail space will continue to slow. The retail market may still be weak in Orchard/Scotts Road due to the dearth of tourist arrivals. Similarly, in the Other City Areas, the retail market is impacted adversely as employees are still working from home as a default. As employees gradually return to their offices, we expect retail sales in the CBD area to pick up. However, retail in the Orchard/Scotts Road subzone will remain weighed down due to the restrictions on foreign visitors into the country. The Covid-19 pandemic will accelerate transformation in the retail scene. With the presence of more firms offering an omnichannel approach, retailers will need to ensure complementary online and offline offerings. In addition, we also see greater use of retail spaces being converted to office use due to the slowing demand. 13 EDMUND TIE RESEARCH RESIDENTIAL Market commentary Key indicators * Based on 3Q 2020 Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) flash estimates, private home prices continued to increase by 0.8% qoq, after 0.3% in 2Q 2020 (Table 10). This was driven by the landed segment, which surged by 3.8% qoq after staying constant in 2Q 2020. * Private non-landed property prices held firm qoq in 3Q 2020 after a qoq growth of 0.4% in 2Q 2020, with prices in the RCR and OCR expanding by 3.3% and 1.7% qoq respectively. On the other hand, prices in the CCR declined by 4.9% qoq, a reversal from the 2.7% growth in 2Q 2020. * Housing loans value rose for the fourth consecutive quarter by 9.7% yoy in 2Q 2020 (Figure 12). However, on a qoq basis, housing loans fell by 5.0% amid the economic gloom, job uncertainties and prohibition of home viewings. * On 28 September 2020, URA prohibited developers from re-issuing options to purchase (OTP) to the same buyer of the same unit within 12 months after the expiry of the earlier OTP. Upfront agreements to buyers to re-issue OTPs were also prohibited. The move aimed to improve the reliability of developer sales figures and encourage financial prudence in home purchases amid the current economic uncertainties.

New sales continued to increase for the fifth consecutive month in September 2020, reaching 1,329 units, which was 5.6% and 4.6% higher on a m-o-m and yoy basis respectively. This could be driven by buyers seeking stable assets in a low-interest rate environment amid volatile equity markets and economic uncertainties, as well as having more choices from the increased launches. * In 3Q 2020, there were six new launches (Table 11). Two of the projects recorded take-up rates of above 60%, aided by their competitive pricing. The 50-unit freehold project NoMa at District 14 saw 36 units sold, with a take-up rate of 72%. Its one-bedroom units were fully sold during the early bird preview sales and 66% of the total units were sold. Prices at NoMa ranged from $1,480 to $1,808 psf.

About 341 units of the total 566 units (60.3%) were reportedly sold on its launch weekend, a remarkable reception given the current climate. As at end 3Q 2020, 389 units have been sold. One-and two-bedroom units priced below $1mn attracted many homebuyers. * Resale volume more than tripled from 951 units in 2Q 2020 to 3,149 units in 3Q 2020. This was attributed to home viewings being allowed once again. Covid-related construction delays also may have led homebuyers to consider the resale market. * Despite the Hungry Ghost Festival, total private homes sales volume in 3Q 2020 amounted to 6,819 units, a significant growth from the 2,664 units in 2Q 2020, and 18.3% higher than the 5,763 units a year ago (Figure 13). * Despite the border closures, demand from foreigners have improved. In 3Q 2020, foreigners purchased 225 private residential properties, which was 89% more than that in 2Q 2020 and even exceeded the 216 units in 1Q 2020. * In the private residential leasing market, total rental volumes rebounded to 26,462 transactions in 3Q 2020 after a qoq decline in 2Q 2020 (Figure 14). Nevertheless, the rental volumes were still 2.1% lower than 3Q 2019, amid pressures on the expatriate employment market. With softening leasing demand, rents are anticipated to decline in 3Q 2020. 153.8 125 130 135 140"}], "max_tokens": 10}}
