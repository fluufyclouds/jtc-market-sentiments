Compared to the initial estimate for new completions in FY24 (more than 2.0mn sqm), the current estimate for new supply expected to come onstream in FY24 has been tapered to c.1.7mn sqm. Although estimates have been lowered, it still represents a spike in new completions, marking the highest level of supply in over five years, since FY17. Single-user factory space continues to make up the bulk of the new supply for the rest of this year - about 61% - while business parks constitute c.21%, with warehouse and multiple-user factory space making up c.14% and c.4%, respectively. During 1Q24, all four industrial segments reported a dip in occupancy rates, mainly due to the delivery of new supply outpacing take-up. Despite this, occupancy rates for multi-user factories and warehouses remain at multi-year highs, above 90%. In contrast, occupancy rates for business parks have fallen to c.78%, similar to levels last seen in early FY11, while occupancy rates for single-user factories have fallen to c.88%, the lowest level on record. Both segments have largely been reporting negative net absorption rates in the past few years as take-up has been slower than the delivery of new supply. For single- user factories, there has been the addition of more than 1.7mn sqm of new supply over the past five years, while take-up was only c.0.7mn sqm, making up only slightly more than 40% of the new stock. Similarly in the business park segment, although new supply over the past five years has been relatively limited, take-up has also been slow and we note that there has been a divergence in performance between business parks in the city fringe area and those in the rest of Singapore. Business parks in city fringe areas such as Harbourfront, Buona Vista, and One North have been faring better in terms of both occupancy and rental rates, as compared to areas such as Changi, Jurong, and Tuas. Singapore PMI continues to expand for the ninth consecutive month. Singapore's May Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) continued to be in expansionary mode for the ninth straight month, recording a 0.1 m/m uptick to 50.6 in May. The electronics sector, which accounts for a third of manufacturing activity, expanded for the seventh consecutive month to 51.1 in May. The overall expansion came from the faster growth in new orders, new exports, and factory output. Finished goods and employment also continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate. In contrast, input prices for manufacturing and supplier deliveries for the electronics sector contracted during the month. Overall business sentiment in the manufacturing sector remains positive. Businesses surveyed by the Economic Development Board (EDB) generally anticipate more favourable business conditions in the next six months, as compared to 1Q24. Among them, firms in the semiconductor and electronic module and component segments are especially upbeat. Their optimistic outlook stems from higher demand for consumer electronic devices, and strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers, which require memory, storage, and networking chips. Firms in the precision engineering, transport engineering, and general manufacturing segments also anticipate an improvement in business conditions in the next six months. What are we watching? Take-up rates of industrial properties. With the continued delivery of new supply of industrial stock, occupancy rates across the various segments posted a slight dip q/q. Only the multiple-user factory segment saw occupancy rates remaining flat q/q, while all the other segments reported a 0.2-0.5ppt decline. As more than 1.6mn sqm of new supply is projected to be delivered for the rest of FY24, we believe it would put further downside pressure on occupancy rates, especially for the single-user factory and business park segments. For the business park segment, we believe the divergence in performance between the city fringe and precincts in the rest of the island could widen further. With c.233,000sqm of new business park supply at Punggol Digital District (PDD) expected to come online in FY24, we believe that tenants who are currently based in precincts outside of the city fringe could be tempted to relocate to PDD.

Rental Index: Rentals for industrial properties are at an all-time high Source: JTC Corporation, DBS * Overall Industrial Properties Rental Index has been on an uptrend since late FY20, likely due to a lack of new supply as construction delays hit. * The Industrial Properties Rental Index is currently at an all-time high of 108.2. The rise has been primarily driven by the multiple-user factory and warehouse segments, which reported a 7.5% and 6.6% increase in rents in FY23, respectively. * The multiple-user and warehouse rental indices are currently at 108.7 and 102.3, respectively, the highest levels on record. * The Single-User Rental Index is currently at 110.5, also the highest level on record. Despite vacancy rates inching up over the past few years, rents for single-user factory space have been increasing, likely due to inflation. * The Business Parks Rental Index is currently at 120.5, the highest level since FY10. This phenomenon is likely due to the addition of the higher quality business park space, with higher specifications that are able to command higher rents. 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 2012Q2 2012Q3 4Q12 1Q13 2Q13 3Q13 4Q13 1Q14 2Q14 3Q14 4Q14 1Q15 2Q15 3Q15 4Q15 1Q16 2Q16 3Q16 4Q16 1Q17 2Q17 3Q17 4Q17 1Q18 2Q18 3Q18 4Q18 1Q19 2Q19 3Q19 4Q19 1Q20 2Q20 3Q20 4Q20 1Q21 2Q21 3Q21 4Q21 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 Industrial Property Multi-user Single-user Warehouse Business Park Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 4 . Key Charts: Industrial Sector Bumper crop of new supply expected to continue into FY24F Source: JTC Corporation, DBS * A total of c.0.9mn sqm in new industrial space was added to the market in FY23, c.0.4mn sqm less than the amount last year. Similarly, the amount of new supply during these two years is now at the highest level since FY17, a result of a rollover in project completions from prior years, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to construction delays and disruptions to supply chains. * Of the c.0.9mn sqm of new supply that was delivered in FY23, single-user factory space contributes c.33%, which is likely to have been developed by industrialists for their own use. * Delivery of new warehouse space in FY23 constituted c.23% of the supply, easing the strong demand and shortage seen in the previous two years. * Multiple-user factory space and business parks make up the remaining 44% of new supply delivered in FY23. * Take-up of multiple-user and warehouse space has been robust in FY23, with positive net absorption over the past three years despite the delivery of the new stock. However, the spike in supply expected in FY24F and FY25F may put some pressure on occupancy and rental rates going forward. * More than 1.6mn sqm of new industrial properties are expected to be completed in FY24, the largest amount of new stock since FY17. - 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F 000' sqm Supply Demand Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 5 . Spike in new supply in 2024F likely to lead to continued negative net absorption Source: JTC Corporation, DBS * Net absorption in FY20 and FY21 was positive due to the delays in construction and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. * Although the amount of new industrial supply in FY21 was more than twice FY20's amount, pent-up demand and expansion needs led to a slightly positive net absorption in FY21, with the multi-user factory and warehouse segments being partially offset by the negative net absorption from the single-user factory and business park segments. * With the spike in new industrial supply (c.1.3mn sqm) that hit the market in FY22, we saw negative net absorption, mainly contributed by the single-user factory segment, while other segments like warehouse and business parks reported a slowdown in take-up. * Net absorption in FY23 continued to be negative as new supply continued to outpace demand. Once again, only the multi-user and warehouse segments recorded positive net absorption, while the negative net absorption in the single- user and business park segments continue to weigh down on the overall reading. * In the medium term, we expect net absorption to continue to stay in negative territory as more supply comes online, potentially leading to the softening of occupancy and rental rates in the long term. 10.7% 10.8% 10.1% 9.8% 10.6% 11.0% 11.4% 11.7% 11.8% 12.0% 1.0% 3.0% 5.0% 7.0% 9.0% 11.0% 13.0% (6.0) (4.0) (2.0) - 2.0 4.0 6.0 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F m' sqft Net Absorption Rate Market Vacancy Rate (%) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 6 . Rental reversion trend expected to remain healthy in the medium term Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS * After several years of negative rental reversions (three-year cycle) for the factory and warehouse segments, the trend reversed in FY21. * Positive rental reversions started to pick up pace in FY22 as take-up from pent-up demand quickly backfilled vacant space, especially in the multi-user and warehouse segments. * The positive rental reversion cycle continued into FY23 for the warehouse and factory segments, owing to strong demand, despite the pick-up in new supply. * Overall rentals in the near term are expected to continue to remain healthy, even as more new supply is expected to come online, mainly due to the \"low base\" effect in the prior years. * Over the last two years, the logistics sector has been driven by the advancement of e-commerce and stockpiling activities. This has led to the outperformance of rentals for the warehouse segment, and we believe its outperformance will continue through to the coming years. * Most rents expiring in the near term were signed during the lows of the COVID-19 pandemic (FY20/21). As such, we expect rental reversions to remain in positive territory in the coming years before tapering off in FY26. -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% 30% 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F % reversions (3-year cycle) Business Park Warehouse Factory Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 7 . Industrial Sub-sector - Multi-User Factory Multi-user factory supply: Supply spike has been well absorbed and will normalise in the next few years Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS Bank * New completions picked up in FY22 after more than three years of construction delays. A total of 634,000sqm of new supply of multi-user factory space was delivered in FY22, the largest increase in annual supply in over a decade. * Despite the spike in supply, take-up of multi-user factory space was very strong. A total of 442,000sqm of space was taken up in FY22, thereby cushioning the increase in the vacancy rate. The vacancy rate in FY22 was 10.9% - an increase of only 100bps. * The sudden spike in both supply and demand in FY22 was likely a result of construction delays over the past three years as well as pent-up demand from businesses waiting to occupy the newly completed projects. * In FY23, the multi-user factory segment reported another year of very healthy demand. Approximately 460,000sqm of space was taken up in FY23, the strongest annual take-up seen on record. * Looking ahead, we see a slight increase in the vacancy rate over the next two years as delivery of new supply normalises and the rising vacancies at single-user factory space could flow over and sub-letting could lead to competition for tenants that would have otherwise taken up multi-user factory space. * We also expect to see a divergence in performance between newer properties with higher specifications that cater to specific industries (e.g., food manufacturing, life sciences, technology, etc.), and older general industrial properties with lower specifications. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% (1.0) - 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F '000 Sqm Multi-User Factory Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 8 . Multi-user factories: Rebound in occupancy rate as delivery of new stock slows down in FY23 Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS * Rentals surprised on the upside, with a c.8.2% increase in FY22 despite the spike in new supply delivered. This was likely due to cost inflation as well as higher rents commanded by the newer multi-user factory. * In FY23, occupancy and rental rates also continued to surprise on the upside despite the spike in delivery of new supply. Occupancy and rental rates hit record highs in 4Q23, and have seemingly not slowed down y/y. * However, we expect some downward pressure in occupancy rates going ahead, as the market must gradually backfill the bumper crop of new supply in FY22 and FY23. * Rents could also see some downward pressure, but we believe it will remain relatively sticky in the near term. In fact, rentals in 1Q24 remained on an upward trajectory, rising 1.3% q/q. * The rising vacancy rate in the single-user factory segment could lead to a spillover effect, with industrialists sub-letting some of their factory space to tenants that would have taken up space in multi-user factories instead. 85% 86% 87% 88% 89% 90% 91% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024f 2025f 2026f 2027f 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 S$ psf pm Multi-User Factory Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 9 .

Excluding FY20, this has been the slowest pace of delivery of new supply in the past decade. * With the logistics sector's continued expansion in FY22 and FY23, demand remained relatively healthy, and we saw a strong backfilling of available space in the market. Occupancies remained high through FY23, at levels not seen since FY14. * Third-party logistics businesses and those supporting the e-commerce sector are expected to continue driving demand for modern warehouse space in the medium term. * Even with more new supply expected to be added to the market in FY24, we believe occupancy rates will remain relatively stable, with continued strong demand for modern warehouses and the redevelopment of older stock. * We may start to see a divergence in performance between modern logistics warehouses and traditional cargo lift warehouses as occupiers opt for newer, ramped up facilities. 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% - 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 12.0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F '000 Sqm Warehouse Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 10 . Warehouses: Despite some new supply coming online, occupancy and rental rates are expected to remain robust Source: JTC Corporation, Urban Redevelopment Authority, DBS * After six years of consecutive declines in rents, rental rates for warehouses started to pick up from early FY21 as supply was absorbed, boosted by demand for stockpiling and the growth of the logistics sector. * Riding on the surge in demand for storage and delays in the completion of new supply, occupancy rates remained stable at 92% in FY23 despite the increase in new completions. * Rents also continued to pick up along with improving occupancy rates and are currently at levels not seen since FY15. * Although the warehouse segment is expected to experience another spike in new supply in FY24, we expect overall warehouse occupancy and rental rates to remain relatively stable and even continue inching up, driven by the continued expansion in the logistics sector. * Moreover, the redevelopment of older warehouses could see some stock being taken offline, moderating the growth in warehouse space in the coming years. * Despite some softening in occupancy rates earlier in FY23, healthy take-up rates in the past two quarters led to an improvement in occupancy rates, to c.91.6%, in 4Q23. * However, we could start to see a divergence in occupancy and rental performance between the modern logistics warehouses and the older general warehouses, which could all face stiff competition. 85.0% 86.0% 87.0% 88.0% 89.0% 90.0% 91.0% 92.0% 93.0% - 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 2019 2020 2021 2022 2025f 2026f 2027f 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 S$ psf pm Warehouse Rental (LHS) Occupancy (%) (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 11 .

However, we believe that there has been a divergence in performance among business parks in the city fringe and elsewhere. * Vacancy rates have continued to inch up, reaching c.22.0% at present, and we believe that the spike in new supply in FY24 could lead to further pressure on occupancy rates. * Although the bulk of the new supply of business park space is coming from the Punggol Digital District, which is understood to be significantly pre-committed, we believe demand will not grow as quickly as new supply. * As business parks in the city fringe precincts of Buona Vista and Alexandra are favoured over the rest of the island, we believe these will outperform business parks in other areas such as Jurong, Changi, and Tuas. * Moreover, business park precincts in Buona Vista and Alexandra are expected to remain more resilient than the rest of the island due to its unique positioning of catering to tenants from the biomedical, life sciences, technology, and R&D sectors. 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% (0.5) - 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024F 2025F 2026F 2027F '000 Sqm Business Park Supply Demand Vacancy (RHS) Industry Outlook Singapore Industrial REITs Page 12 .

Understanding the fine print: Standard terms & conditions 7 2 Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide 1. Leasing a logistics & industrial facility 3 Successfully navigating the leasing process for your logistics and industrial facility calls for meticulous attention to detail and consideration of various factors. To start off on the right foot, it is crucial to stay updated on the latest market data, trends, and insights. This knowledge will empower you to make informed, future- proof real estate decisions that unlock the full potential of your logistics and industrial operations. Key factors to prioritise when selecting a suitable location for your new facility include proximity to major transportation routes and the ability of the facility to effectively optimise space utilisation. In addition, it is important to ensure that the chosen location aligns with the specific operational requirements of your business. Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide When it comes to negotiations, engaging a real estate advisor allows you to leverage well-established relationships with landlords to discuss favourable lease terms, while avoiding potential pitfalls or hidden expenses in the process. Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide 2. Different types of leases explained 4 When it comes to leasing your new facility, be it a basic warehouse or a specialised industrial facility, there are three lease options to consider. Leases of ready-built logistics and industrial facilities These leases are for facilities that are currently on the market, which are recently developed or are previously occupied by other tenants. Second-hand facilities tend to be more affordable, although the price may vary depending on factors like the building's specifications, location, as well as market supply and competition. For occupiers seeking a cost-effective, time-efficient option, a ready-built facility is the ideal lease choice. Assuming there is suitable space available, a lease can be negotiated and agreed upon within a few months. Furthermore, occupiers typically only need to commit for a maximum of three years, making it a flexible option. Pre-leases for new developments Pre-leases are leasing agreements involving developments that are either still in the planning stage, or are nearing completion, where the developer has built the facility speculatively without any tenants confirmed. For such facilities, occupiers have the opportunity to secure a pre-lease before completion if they are satisfied with the location. By committing early, occupiers may enjoy additional benefits such as improved incentives including lower rent, longer rent-free periods, or the ability to request specifications that align with their operational requirements. Leases for build-to-suit facilities This option caters to occupiers with precise requirements and flexibility on timelines. These occupiers often require a custom-built facility that perfectly aligns with their specific needs and cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. However, this customised process comes with a significant investment of time and cost, as the completion timeline for the facility could be years away. Typically, the lease commitment for a build-to-suit facility will be a minimum of 10 to 15 years, and often at a higher rent. Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide 3. Six steps to negotiate your next lease 5 To kick-start your leasing journey, follow these six key steps for a smooth, effective negotiation process: 1. Capture your detailed requirements Start by identifying and documenting your needs and preferences for the leased space. Consider factors like size, layout, amenities, location, and specific technical requirements. This will serve as your guiding document throughout the negotiation process. 2. Research and provide all potential options currently available in the market and any off- market opportunities Work with your real estate advisor to conduct comprehensive market research to get an overview of all potential leasing options available. 3. Inspect all shortlisted options Schedule visits to the shortlisted properties to assess their suitability for your requirements. Take note of unique features, practicalities, or concerns during these inspections. 4. Analyse options, form tailored strategy, and agree next steps Analyse and weigh the shortlisted options based on your requirements, preferences, and needs. Formulate a tailored negotiation strategy, which may involve prioritising certain properties or considering alternative negotiation tactics for each property. 5. Engage and negotiate with shortlisted landlords Initiate negotiations with the landlords of the shortlisted properties to communicate your requirements before settling on the terms and conditions including lease terms, rent, incentives, and other commercial considerations. 6. Review commercial terms in formal documentation Once an agreement is reached, review the final commercial terms in the lease agreement with help from your real estate advisor and legal team. Carefully review all clauses, including rent, lease duration, renewal options, maintenance responsibilities, and any special provisions or conditions. Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide 4. When should you start negotiating your next lease? Now that you're aware of the steps involved, it's necessary to plan ahead and account for the timeline needed in the negotiation process. This can vary depending on the size and type of space, but it typically takes a few months to secure ready-built space. If you opt for a pre-lease or build-to-suit option, it may take longer. Indicative timeline for leasing a 5,000-10,000 sq m logistics and industrial facility Total estimated time: 12 to 16 weeks * Preliminary option evaluation and shortlisting * Site inspections * Review potential options internally * Work on cost estimates * Request for proposals sent out * Negotiation with shortlisted landlords and test-fit * Choose between renewing/ relocating/downsizing * Conclude discussions and provide initial deposit * Project appointment * Discussion on space utilisation/ spot cost-saving opportunities, timeline, and criteria * Issue, negotiate offer letter * Review, agree, sign offer letter * Agreement issuing, reviewing * Signing of agreement * Serve notice to discontinue the lease with current landlord 1 4 2 5 3 6 * Handover date/fit-out period * Designer briefing, bidding, selection * Designer appointment * Design and approvals * Fit-out construction/Reinstatement of existing leased premise * Conclude facility relocation or expansion Requirements 1-2 weeks Legalities 2-3 weeks Market review 1-2 weeks Project management 4-6 weeks Negotiation 2-3 weeks Transition 1-2 weeks 6 Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide 5. Understanding the fine print: Standard terms & conditions The lease is basically a written agreement outlining the rights and responsibilities of both the tenant and the landlord. To ensure that all parties are well-informed and protected, having a clear understanding of every aspect, down to the fine print, is essential before putting pen to paper. Below are some of the important terms and conditions (T&Cs) to watch for, and what they entail: Lease terms Lease terms in Asia Pacific are typically for three years, potentially with an option to renew every three years. Longer terms are possible and, in the case of build-to-suit facilities, landlords will typically demand a longer lease commitment. Security deposit Equivalent to three to six months of gross rental and service charges on average. One month is deposited upon the execution of the offer letter and the remaining upon executing the lease and service agreement. Rent Rent is generally paid monthly and is calculated with reference to the leased area as defined by the landlord. The rent is often exclusive of service fees and is typically fixed for the lease term, or until the agreed rent review date. Utilities service All payments and charges for the use of electricity, direct telephone lines, air-conditioning, water supply, communication services and other utilities and facilities provided by the service provider in the agreement. 7 Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide Sub-letting, alienation and early termination rights Such lease flexibilities can be included within the lease contract but are dependent on the local market practice and landlord's approval. Insurance Procurement of all-risk and third-party insurance with a reputable insurance company (approved by the owner) against all risks of damage, loss, theft, or destruction. Stamp duty The tenant is usually responsible for paying the stamp duty for the duration of the lease where applicable. In Thailand, for instance, the stamp duty stands at 0.1% of the rental and service costs. Management fee The fee is payable monthly in advance and based on the leased area. Management fees generally include building security, lift maintenance and cleaning of common areas. Fit-out period and rent-free period The fit-out period allows the tenant to install necessary equipment for the intended purpose, while the rent-free period is generally offered by the landlord to provide a limited period during which rental is not payable under the lease. The duration of these two periods is subject to negotiation. Reinstatement provisions Standard reinstatement terms in an agreement typically specify that the facility must be restored to its original condition upon handover. 8 Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide Option to renew Options to renew may be considered, subject to market conditions and a cap on increase in rent. Sale or redevelopment clause In situations where there are ownership changes or redevelopment plans for the site where the leased facility is located, the landlord may have the right to regain possession of the property. Occupiers should seek legal advice to understand and navigate their rights and obligations in such circumstances. Rent reviews Long leases (over three years) normally incorporate a rent review prior to the expiry of the third year. Rent is normally reviewed to the current open market level and capped at a pre-agreed cap rate, which will vary from lease to lease. Fit-out subsidies Capital contributions for fit-outs are generally not open for negotiation. 9 Logistics & industrial / A comprehensive leasing guide 10 Space occupiers should be aware of and prepared for additional costs. It is important to have all the necessary information beforehand, so here is a list of the associated costs that you should be aware of and budget for in advance. Fit-out costs Possession of the premises is normally provided in pre-decorated (i.e. warm-shell) condition. Cost associated with fitting out the space will be borne by the tenant. Fit-out insurance To cover any damage to the building or third party during the fit-out period. It is usually paid for by the contractor. Value Added Tax (VAT) and other taxes For countries where VAT is applicable, the occupier is responsible for the payment of VAT charges. Anything in excess levied by the government shall be borne and paid by the occupier. Associated costs Legal fees Both landlord and occupier will bear their own legal costs in the negotiation and execution of the lease and any further documentation required. Vetting fees Landlords may charge a fee for the vetting and approval of layout plans, together with a management charge for works in progress. Reinstatement Tenants must reinstate their premises at their own cost before the expiration of their tenancy. Agency fees * New letting: If an occupier enters into a lease agreement with a new landlord, the landlord typically pays the agent a fee, which is normally a month's rent for a standard lease term. * Renewal: The occupier typically pays appointed agent an agency fee.

The 1.7% rental growth marks the 14th consecutive quarterly increase.. The rise in rent was led by business parks and single-user factory space, which grew 2.1%, respectively. For the business park segment, the 2.1% q-o-q growth in 1Q2024 is an acceleration from the 0.3% q- 0-q increase in 4Q2023 and is likely to be driven by selected deals in premium spaces, says Tricia Song, CBRE head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia. CBRE\u2019s Song points to the rents in one-north, which increased the most last quarter, up 16.3% q-o-q. However, she adds that the overall demand for business parks has remained cautious. The warehouse and multiple-user factory segments also rose this quarter, reporting a 2% and 1.3% increase, respectively. \u201cDemand for high-spec warehouse space in ramp-up developments remains resilient,\u201d says Song. While some occupiers have shown resistance to increasing rents, she notes that they remain keen on new projects, for instance, 4 Benoi Crescent, which was fully leased upon completion. Multiple-user factory rents showed the highest y-o-y growth, rising 8.9% compared to 1Q2023. Warehouse rents grew by 7.5%, followed by single-user factories and business parks at 6.1% and 5%, respectively. However, rental transaction volume fell by 9% y-o-y, which Lee Sze Teck, senior director of data analytics at Huttons Asia, attributes to a weakening demand for industrial spaces. Growth in the manufacturing sector slowed to 0.8% y-o-y in 1Q2024, a drop from the 1.4% y-o-y growth in 4Q2023, he says. In comparison, flash estimates put Singapore's overall economic growth for 1Q2024 at 2.7%. Demand drops Demand for industrial space in 1Q2024 contracted by 19,000 sqm (204,516 sq ft) for the first time since 4Q2022, adds Huttons\u2019 Lee. Coupled with the large completion of 126,000 sq m (1.36 million sq ft) of industrial space, the occupancy rate of industrial space eased by 0.3 percentage points to 88.7% in 1Q 2024. Weakening demand was also reflected in transaction prices, which fell 0.2% across all segments in 1Q2024. It marks the first time prices have fallen after 13 straight quarters of price growth. The drop was underpinned by the single-user factory space, which fell 1%. Prices in the multiple-user factory segment saw a growth of 0.5% since the start of the year. JTC data showed that the Islandwide industrial vacancy rate climbed to 11.3% in 192024, the highest in 23 quarters. Tan Boon Leong, executive director of logistics & industrial, JLL, attributes it to the near doubling in new space from 65,000 sq m (699,660 sq ft) in 4Q2023 to 127,000 sq m (1.37 million sq ft) in1Q2024. On an annual basis, industrial prices reported an overall growth of 3.3%, led by multiple-user factories which grew by 4.6% since 1Q2023. Prices of single-user factories also grew by 1.8% y-o-y. Overall sale transactions for industrial properties also dropped 2% y-o-y. CBRE\u2019s Song attributes the fall to more buyers and manufacturers adopting a cautious approach to purchases. \u201cWhile investors generally expect interest rates to come down by year-end, the uncertainty over the timing of these interest rate cuts could have dampened sentiment for some investors,\u201d say Huttons\u2019 lee. Occupancy rates, new supply Occupancy rates also fell across the board last quarter except for multiple-user factories which maintained its 90.5% occupancy rate. Occupancy in single-user factories fell by 0.2% to 87.8%, and business park occupancy fell by 0.4% to 78%. Warehouse occupancy fell the most last quarter, with a 0.5% drop to 91.1%. Compared to the same period last year, this reflects a drop of 0.1% in occupancy rates across all segments. JTC attributes the fall in occupancy to an increased supply in the market last quarter. Over 126,000 sqm (about 1.36 million sq ft) of new industrial supply was introduced in 1Q2024, a 0.2% increase from the previously available stock. This brings the total available supply as of end-March to 53 million sqm (570.5 million sq ft). About 1.6 million sq ft more industrial space is due for completion for the rest of 2024, which is higher than the average new supply of | million sq ft, seen in the last three years. Demand for industrial space over the same period averaged at 600,000 sq ft. As new supply comes onstream, landlords may have to soften rents and be more flexible to smaller space requirements to remain competitive, says Catherine He, head of research at Colliers Singapore. Currently available older stock may also undergo redevelopment or refurbishments as the market continues its flight to high-quality modern facilities, she adds. Colliers forecasts overall industrial rents in 2024 to grow between 3% to 5%, while overall prices is projected to grow between 1% and 3%."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Business parks and single-user factory drove overall industrial rental growth at 2.1% q-o-q each; this is also the highest quarterly growth recorded for business parks since 2Q 2017. The price index declined by 0.2%q-o-q, its first decline after thirteen quarters of consecutive growth. Growth for both price and rents are expected to continue moderating in light of slowing global growth and higher supply. Factory The rental indices for multiple-user/single-user factory have increased by 1.3%/2.1% q-o-q respectively, to come in at 8.9%/6.1% y-o-y. Demand at multiple-user factories, especially higher specification spaces, were driven by biomedical and engineering firms, albeit at a slower pace, with most tenants looking at smaller spaces (<10k sf). For single-user factories, there is a surge of supply coming on stream in 2024 though these are typically developed by the industrialists for their own use; demand in this segment has been supported by advanced manufacturing players. However, together with overall softer demand and leasing activity, rental and price growth for both types are likely to slow going forward. Warehouse The segment registered a rental increase of 2.0% q-o-q and saw occupancy decline to 91.1% from 91.6% in the previous quarter. Supply continued to be tight this quarter, especially in the prime logistics space where there is no upcoming supply for the rest of the year. 3PLs and consumer products are the main demand drivers for warehouses. However, more space will be coming to the market as some tenants downsize or relocate in view of elevated rents, coupled with higher supply completing in 2025. Occupiers might also be resistant to the higher rents and more may opt to develop sites themselves, partner with a developer, or relocate to cheaper locations. This is likely to cause occupancy rates and rents to ease further. Business Park rents grew by 2.1% q-o-q in Q1 2024, the fastest growth since 2Q 2017. This is likely to be driven by the newer and better located business parks. On the other hand, occupancy has declined by 40 bps to 78.0% this quarter, with vacancies remaining elevated, especially in the outlying and older business parks, which could lead to softening rents. Overall demand for business park spaces remained muted, with more renewals and occupiers right-sizing. Space requirements are also small, at <10k sf. Older buildings or those in decentralized areas have been observed to be more flexible in rental and incentive negotiation to attract or retain tenants. There are also companies looking for corporate offices in these spaces after relocating their manufacturing operations. Nevertheless, leasing activity may pick up with new supply coming on stream in the later part of the year. 3 Lynus Pook Executive Director Industrial Services Singapore \"The global demand for artificial intelligence chips is expected to have spillover effects and provide tailwinds for the industrial sector, while international firms continue to set up or expand their manufacturing operations in Singapore.\" However, rental growth is expected to moderate in light of the higher cost of capital, tenant resistance to higher rents, and the higher upcoming supply. There has also been more renewals and consolidations than relocations or expansions, highlighting the financial constraints occupiers are facing. On the investment front, there is likely to be more sale and leaseback transactions or portfolio sales to monetize assets. There are also likely to be more redevelopments and refurbishments of older assets in view of the preference for high quality modern industrial facilities. In anticipation of an economic recovery, REITs with sufficient debt headroom may also be on the lookout for suitable assets to acquire. In light of slower global growth under elevated capital costs, Colliers is projecting the overall industrial rent growth for 2024 to moderate to between 3 to 5% and price growth to between 1 to 3%. Rental growth will likely be led by the warehouse segment at 4 to 6%. There will continue to be a ramp-up of supply in the next few years; from 2024 to 2026, there is an average annual supply of 1.1 mil sqm coming onstream, exceeding the average annual supply and demand of 1.0 mil sqm and 0.6 mil sqm respectively over the past three years.

Forecast 12-Mo. Forecast Gradual Manufacturing Recovery Singapore's economy is anticipated to grow by 2.7% yoy in 2024, accelerating from 1.1% in 2023. The official 2024 forecast for non-oil domestic exports (NODX) has been upgraded to 4.0%-6.0% yoy, due to optimism of a gradual recovery in global electronics demand as inventory levels normalise. The latest economic indicators signaled at a gradual recovery of the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing output grew 3.8% yoy in February, led by the biomedical manufacturing cluster. The Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remained in expansion territory for the sixth consecutive month in February. Rent Growth to Moderate due to Increasing Tenant Resistance Due to a persistent tight supply situation and resilient demand from third-party logistics (3PL) players, prime logistics rents rose by 3.6% qoq in Q1 2024, according to C&W's basket of industrial properties. A flight to quality continues to characterise the business park and high-tech markets. High-tech properties recorded rental growth of 4.0% qoq, driven by newer and better-located properties. City fringe and suburban business parks saw diverging performance with city fringe business park rents inching up slightly by 0.4% qoq while suburban business parks saw a rental decline of 0.9% qoq. On the other hand, factory and warehouse rents remained flat in Q1 2024. Leasing activities are expected to pick up in 2024 alongside an improving manufacturing economy. However, the manufacturing recovery remains fragile and moderate rental growth is expected in 2024 due to increasing tenant resistance, still-elevated financing costs and higher supply pipeline for most property types. Many industrial tenants are choosing to renew rather than relocate, highlighting current CapEX constraints amidst a tight financing environment. With a tight supply situation persisting, prime logistics could witness still-strong but moderating rental growth of 5.0% yoy in 2024 from previous year's 9.7% growth. Warehouse rental growth is forecasted to ease to 4.0%, on the back of a surge in supply this year. Other assets are expected to see mild rental growth of between 2.0%-3.0% yoy in 2024. Industrial Investment Interest Remains Steady On the investment front, interest for industrial properties remains healthy due to their relatively higher yields and favourable long-term prospects. Assets with value-add potential are sought after, particularly for assets which can cater to emerging new economy industries such as self-storage, cold chain and data centers. For example, a notable industrial transaction in Q1 2024 was BDx's acquisition of their own data center (OneTen Paya Lebar) for about SGD 140 million, at an estimated net yield of 3.4%. The acquisition allows BDx the flexibility to asset enhance or redevelop the site in line with robust data center demand in Singapore.

The manufacturing sector grew by 0.8% y-o-y in the first three months of the year, slower than the 1.4% y-o-y increase in the fourth quarter of 2023. GDP growth forecast for 2024 is projected at 1.0% to 3.0% for the whole of 2024. In February 2024, Singapore's total manufacturing output was reported by the Economic Development Board (EDB) to have increased 3.8% y-o-y. Four out of the six manufacturing clusters recorded growth, with expansions of 27.4% in biomedical manufacturing, 19.6% in transport engineering, 11.2% in chemicals and 2.6% in electronics. The other two clusters, general manufacturing and precision engineering recorded declines of 3.4% and 19.9% respectively. Business expectations for the manufacturing sector were cautiously positive with all clusters expanding except for chemicals, as a net weighted balance of 10% of manufacturers anticipated overall improvement for the period between January and June 2024. The overall Singapore Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) recorded 50.7 in March, a marginal increase of 0.1 from 50.6 in February. The electronics PMI showed a larger increment of 0.4 to 50.8 in March from 50.4 in February with the recovering global semiconductor industry. With demand for artificial intelligence memory chips, the electronics sector is expected to be a key driver in 2024 that mitigates economic headwinds and sustains recovery in the manufacturing sector and exports for the rest of the year. WANING PRICES AND RENTS OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES Sales activity slowed in the first quarter of 2024 with 337 caveats lodged, a decrease of 21.3% from the previous quarter when 428 caveats were lodged (Exhibit 1). However, industrial sales value was similar to the previous quarter at S$709.7 million, a 1.0% increase from the S$702.7 million in the previous quarter. Despite this, a few large industrial deals were successfully transacted during the quarter. For instance, the sale of a data centre named OneTen Paya Lebar to BDx Data Centres from Hwa Hong Corporation Group for S$140.0 million, the sale of a single-user factory located at Senoko Loop for S$53.2 million, and the sale of two industrial properties located at Commonwealth Drive situated within Tanglin Halt Industrial Estate for a total of S$50.6 million, all of which were transacted in February. Notwithstanding the slowdown in sales, interest based on enquires from both end-users and investors remained healthy and could translate into more transactions, especially when interest rates are cut. End-users remain keen on shorter tenure facilities to mitigate their capital costs, while investors are predisposed towards assets with longer tenures. In the first quarter of 2024, industrial leasing volume amounted to 2,948 transactions, showing a decline of 6.5% compared to the corresponding period in the previous quarter. However, the value of rental transactions was 9.5% higher at S$28.5 million, as demand for \"Sentiment in the manufacturing sector has turned a corner and this will in turn contribute to the continued resilience of industrial real estate.\" NORISHIKIN KHALIK, DIRECTOR, OCCUPIER STRATEGY AND SOLUTIONS knightfrank.com.sg/research Q1 2024 2,948LEASES Number of Industrial Tenancies 6.5% Q-O-Q | 8.7% Y-O-Y S$709.7MILLION Total Industrial Sales 1.0% Q-O-Q | 24.5% Y-O-Y 38.4 Upcoming Supply (2024 to 2028) MILLION SF GFA Singapore Research Industrial & Logistics Exhibit 1: Industrial Sales Performance Number of Transactions Average Price (S$ psf) Source: JTC J-Space, Knight Frank Research Note: The average unit price is based on a four-quarter moving average of strata transactions. *Q1 2024 data is based on transactions downloaded as at 12 April 2024. $1,200 $1,000 $800 $600 $400 $200 $0 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2019 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2020 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2021 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2022 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Multiple-user Factory Single-user Factory Warehouse Number of Transactions (Bar), Average Price (Line) industrial properties remained intact, contributing to the increase in the total value of rental transactions.

MANUFACTURERS CONTINUED TO START OR EXPAND OPERATIONS IN SINGAPORE Singapore received S$1.7 billion in fixed asset investment (FAI) in the last quarter of 2023, bringing the total for the whole of 2023 to S$12.7 billion. The flow of incoming manufacturing investments to Singapore trickled towards the end of the year declining 76.9% from Q3 2023 when S$7.4 billion in FAI was recorded. It is likely that the pause in investments in the near term is due to the shift in global tax changes with large multinational enterprises (MNEs) evaluating the incentives offered by other countries as Singapore introduces a minimum effective tax rate of 15% for MNEs from January 2025 to align with the second pillar of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative (BEPS) 2.0 - a global tax pact comprising more than 140 countries. Nevertheless, with access to talent, political stability, and greater ease of entering Southeast Asian markets, global firms continued to exhibit interest to open new headquarters and factories in Singapore. For example, Japanese manufacturer Toppan Holdings reportedly invested S$450 million into building a semiconductor packaging materials plant located at Pesawat Drive in Jurong. The plant is expected to begin operations at the end of 2026. Additionally, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis will be injecting S$342.3 million to expand its biopharmaceutical manufacturing plant here, with the enlarged plant also expected to be operational by early 2026. The stream of entry and expansion of international manufacturers into Singapore shows the potential and opportunities to establish a stable manufacturing location in SUBSCRIBE to updates and reports delivered to your inbox SIGN UP ONLINE About Knight Frank Singapore Knight Frank LLP is the leading independent global property consultancy.

MARKET OUTLOOK Although the industrial real estate sector was quiet in Q1 2024, the return to growth in the manufacturing sector will underpin its stability, a stability that is important to globally linked producers. Key industrial indicators such as prices, rents and occupancy levels are anticipated to remain relatively stable across the various industrial property types for the rest of the year. Economic indicators of GDP, manufacturing output and PMI showed positive returns, signalling a more optimistic outlook for the remaining three quarters of 2024 despite challenges and global tensions. International firms continue to view Singapore to be a suitable place to enter and/or expand their operations due to a quality workforce and proximity to the Southeast Asian market. Overall factory rental and price growth for 2024 is expected to grow by 3% to 5%, with a more optimistic increase of above 5% for warehouses as demand for high quality storage spaces is expected to remain strong.

While manufacturing growth moderated from 1.4% YoY in the previous quarter to 0.8% YoY in Q1/2024, overall services growth improved from 2% YoY to 1.7% YoY in Q1/2024. Despite ongoing uncertainties resulting from geopolitical confl icts and an elevated interest rate environment in most major economies, manufacturing sentiments improved in Q1 with the Singapore's purchasing managers' index (PMI) in March reaching 50.7 - the highest reading since December 2021. On the other hand, Singapore's key exports shrank further in Q1 and posted a steeper contraction in March. Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) shrank 20.7% YoY in March. It was largely attributed to continued weakness in non-electronics shipments, which include pharmaceutical shipments. RENTAL MARKET Industrial leasing momentum has slowed on the back of weak global trade demand. The overall industrial leasing volume1 registered a decline of 7.7% YoY to 2,866 tenancies in Q1, hitting the lowest level since 2020. Leasing volume tapered off across all segments, especially for single-user factory space (-11.3% YoY). While demand for factory space softened as some fi rms could have curtailed expansion plans as part of their cost saving strategies, the momentum in the logistics leasing market also moderated amid weaker ecommerce demand and international trade. Furthermore, the gap between landlord and tenant expectations on rents may have widened, especially for more recent completions which incurred higher development costs. Besides the rental increase, the increase in the total value of rental transactions (+3.0% YoY) could be due to growing interest in larger premises, especially for multiple-user factory and warehouse spaces. In terms of vacancy, single-user factory vacancy inched up again by 0.2 of a percentage point (ppt) QoQ to a new record high at 12.2% in Q1. While vacancy for multiple-user factories remained fl at at 9.5% in Q1, those for warehouses rose to 8.9% (+0.5 of a ppt QoQ) as supply outweighed demand. The index of general industrial rents tracked by JTC showed that industrial rents extended growth into 2024, rising by 1.7% QoQ again in Q1. While rents for the single-user factory and warehouse segments recorded a faster pace of growth at 2.1% QoQ and 2.0% QoQ respectively, those for the multiple-user factory segment rose at 1 Based on JTC's rental data (excluding business park spaces, only comprises single- and multiple-user factory as well as warehouse spaces). a moderated pace of 1.3% QoQ. Meanwhile, Savills' monthly prime industrial rents reached a record high since our data was constituted. While warehouse and logistics property2 rents rose 2.0% QoQ to S$1.68 per sq ft, multiple-user factory3 rents saw an uptick of 0.5% QoQ to S$2.23 per sq ft in Q1. SALES MARKET Strata industrial sales activity4 remained lacklustre in Q1, falling at a faster pace of 21.8% QoQ to 319 transactions. This marked the lowest point since 2020 when the market was hit by the pandemic-led disruptions. Despite the muted appetite in the strata sales market, there is a healthy interest for industrial properties among investors and end-users, which in turn helped to improve the overall market sentiments. In Q1/2024, median prices for multiple- user factory and warehouse increased by 9.1% and 6.3% QoQ respectively, reversing two quarters of decline. This is in line with the 0.5% QoQ increase in the JTC price index for multiple-user factory in the same quarter. Savills' basket of industrial properties also showed prices rising across all tenure types in Q1. Prices for freehold and 60-year leasehold industrial properties increased at a faster rate at 2.2% to S$826 per sq ft and 1.6% QoQ to S$512 per sq ft respectively, while that for 30- year leasehold industrial properties inched up 0.3% QoQ to S$324 per sq ft in Q1. BUSINESS PARK AND HIGH-SPEC INDUSTRIAL The islandwide vacancy level for business parks rose again by 0.4 of a ppt QoQ to 22.0% in Q1, reaching the highest since 2011. This was mainly due to softer demand in the East Planning Region5, where vacancy level in Q1 went up by 1.3 ppt QoQ to 29.4%, hitting a record high since 2009. Business parks in suburban areas remained under pressure as some tenants rightsized their backend operations and more tech companies kept in pace with hybrid work adoption. Although business parks in the Central Planning Region6 showed greater resiliency, nevertheless, the vacancy level also worsened to 11.6% (+0.6 of a ppt QoQ) as the take-up rate remained weak. Meanwhile, a pick-up in demand in Clean Tech Park ended a two-year increase in vacancy level in the West Planning Region, reducing it by 1.1 ppt QoQ to 41.1% in Q1. Nonetheless, business park rents in Q1 were lifted by newer developments.

The ramp-up in supply is likely to put pressure on the vacancy rate and hinder rental growth. On the other hand, upcoming supply for multiple-user factory space will taper to 558,000 sq ft NLA this year, down from the four-year average of 3.2 million sq ft NLA. Although this is not expected to translate to robust rental growth, the tapered supply could help to ease vacancy. With the expected completion of Punggol Digital District by 2024 (which will bring about 3.2 million NLA of new business park space), business park vacancy rate is likely to hit a new high. However, modern and well-managed business parks and high-spec industrial space are expected to see further rental growth. The question remains why, despite rising vacancy levels, are rents still rising? (Please refer to Graph 4) We believe that this seemingly illogical phenomenon has a rational explanation, namely that of tenancy of last resort. As business conditions become more and more challenging, if a company decides not to wind up, the need to contain costs then becomes paramount. SMEs, be it those in the traditional industries or software developers, downshift from larger and more expensive industrial building types to lower cost ones. Also, some SMEs who require small storage space but cannot fi nd those sizes in warehouses - since their lettable area off ered is often much larger - resort to storing it in factories. Therefore, factory space renting for S$1.90 psf pm has now become the backstop for the SMEs who are still not giving up the fi ght in this diffi cult environment. Over time, if business conditions do not improve, we believe that rents may ultimately have to refl ect that. For now, we are maintaining our rental change forecast for multiple-user factories at 0% YoY while those for warehouses are expected to rise between 0% and 3%. PERIOD YoY % CHANGE IN MULTIPLE-USER FACTORY RENTS YoY % CHANGE IN WAREHOUSE & LOGISTICS RENTS 2024F 0% 0% to 3% TABLE 1: Rental Forecast for Multiple-user Factory and Warehouse & Logistics Segments Source Savills Research & Consultancy by JTC posting a strong growth of 2.1% QoQ, Savills' prime business park7 monthly rents increased by 3.7% QoQ to S$6.11 per sq ft in Q1. Some landlords of standard business park properties are keeping their rental expectations realistic to improve occupancy, hence Savills' standard business park8 monthly rents saw a slower growth of 0.8% QoQ to S$4.06 per sq ft in Q1. High-spec industrial spaces, especially those with good accessibility, remain attractive as the supply of such premises has been limited. With the new completions last year, healthy demand supported the rental growth for high-spec industrial space. According to Savills' high-spec industrial basket9, the average monthly rent increased 1.7% QoQ to S$3.96 per sq ft in Q1. This increase is driven mainly by buildings located close to MRT stations and a wide array of amenities. OUTLOOK The global economy is expected to recover this year as infl ation eases and improved supply chain conditions drive consumer expenditure and other economic activities. However, the recovery is likely to be modest as numerous headwinds continue to raise uncertainty levels, impacting investment and consumption decisions. Geopolitical tensions remained the primary upside risk to global infl ation, and thus could potentially weaken the economic recovery momentum this year. Singapore's manufacturing and trade-related sectors are projected to post a gradual pick- up in growth in tandem with the expected turnaround in global electronics demand. The various metrics representing the industrial property market are therefore also expected to see further growth, though at a slower rate. Rents are projected to continue to climb for some segments, led by new and quality developments. While prime warehouse and logistics are likely to lead growth, it could be tempered by the bulk of the supply pipeline slated to come onstream this year (estimated at around 3.7 million sq ft NLA), compared with the average historical completion of 2.5 million sq ft NLA in the last four years. 7 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the newer clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$5.50 per sq ft. 8 Based on business park-zoned spaces in the older clusters which range from 1,000 sq ft to 5,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3.50 per sq ft. 9 Based on offi ce-like industrial space which ranges from 2,000 sq ft to 4,000 sq ft in size, with an average monthly asking rent of at least S$3 per sq ft.
