The planning permission for a residential SoHo unit, for instance, gives it clearance to be used as a home. A separate application has to be made for it to be used as a home-office, and several restrictions apply on the kind of business that can be conducted there.The liberal use of the \"SoHo\" label has drawn flak, given that such units tend to be marketed at a higher price, and buyers find out - too late - that they cannot be freely used as a home and an office.Donald Han, managing director at Chesterton Singapore, said: \"A lot of people bought shoebox units on the basis of the developer describing them in their brochures as SoHo. With more shoebox units headed for completion, there could be grouses on the ground when people realise that there is no such thing as SoHo use.\"The URA has thus issued a circular to developers and their marketing agents, urging them to make it clear to prospective buyers upfront on the approved use of the development. \"Buyers should also find out the approved use of the development before committing to a purchase,\" said a URA spokeswoman.Developers who choose to continue marketing their projects under the \"SoHo\" banner will have to spell out the approved use of the unit in the sale-and-purchase agreement. With residential SoHo units, they must include a clause to specify that the unit is to be used primarily as a home, but that the purchaser can, if he wishes, apply for permission to use the unit as a home-office.Lee Liat Yeang, a partner at Rodyk & Davidson Real Estate Practice Group, said: \"I think URA is concerned that when developers say your unit can be converted to a home office, agents may represent that it can be any kind of office.\"Terms and conditions apply under the Home Office Scheme. One of these is that the business should not hire more than two non-resident employees. Businesses not allowed in home-offices include maid agencies, beauty or massage services, commercial schools, sales or marketing businesses, courier services or businesses which cause disruption in the neighbourhood.Mr Lee said: \"Potentially, you can apply for home office use for any residential property. Of course, the nearer you are to town, the more likely it is. But with town centres now split among Woodlands, Jurong, and Paya Lebar, I won't be surprised if people buy a residential unit there and apply to convert it into a home office.\"On the commercial front, developers and marketing agents can no longer use the term \"SoHo\" to market office developments, given that offices are not allowed for residential use.Mr Lee said this appears to be a clear statement from the URA to discourage developers from using the phrase \"SoHo\" to market office developments.The circular issued yesterday came on the back of a string of both residential and commercial developments being marketed under the SoHo banner, such as Far East Organization's residential projects The Siena and The Cape and its commercial project PS100 in Peck Seah Street. All 100 strata office units at PS100 were snapped up over its launch weekend.That Far East features so prominently in the SoHo space is unsurprising. The group introduced the SoHo concept to Singapore, and unveiled a dedicated Far East SO/HO brand in 2011.Far East's executive director of property services, Chng Kiong Huat, said the group supports the greater clarity on the use of \"SoHo\". None of Far East's commercial developments are currently being marketed for sale under the SO/HO brand, although future residential projects that align with the specific brand attributes will continue to be marketed as such.Mr Chng said: \"We have made it a point to highlight to prospective homebuyers the approved use of the relevant units under the Planning Act. Specifically, we take care to highlight to purchasers of our SO/HO properties that they will need to comply with the requisite conditions set out by the relevant authorities should they intend to use their residential unit as a home-office.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Property prices have appreciated by 85.9% and 60.8% respectively in 4Q13 since the trough in 2Q09. However, there is more to it than just price performance when it comes to landed properties. We uncover a sub\u2010segment that has an unfair advantage. In 2013, the private landed residential property segment in Singapore registered the lowest number of transactions since 1995. Sales dived by 55.7% y\u2010o\u2010y from 3,068 transactions in 2012 to 1,359 transactions (excluding bulk sales) in 2013 despite its raving performance in terms of capital appreciation. Based on URA\u2019s Property Price Index (PPI), landed property prices appreciated by 85.9% in 4Q13 since its last trough in 2Q09, whereas non\u2010landed property prices rose 60.8% during the same period. Landed property prices have outperformed non\u2010landed property prices in two previous cycles. The first happened from 1993 to 1998 and the second, occurring 12 years later, from 2010 to the present (Figure 1). Owners who bought their landed properties during the peak of the cycle in 1996 were the worst hit when property prices toppled in tandem with the declining economy as a result of the Asian Financial Crisis. The property market remained bleak in the early years of the new millennium. Although the market recovered slightly in 1999 but the recovery was short\u2010lived as a result of a series of economic shocks that followed during the early 2000s such as the dot com bubble and SARS. Vacancy rate spiked to an average of 8%, the property market was oversupplied. It took a good 7 years for the property market to recover. The oversupply in the property market was finally reversed in 2006 following a rapid increase in population, especially nonresidents with immediate housing needs, which brought back demand for housing. In addition, the onslaught of new launches as well as a growing interest from foreign investors also helped to invigorate the property market. Owners who bought their landed properties at the peak of the property market in 1996 finally saw the day when they could divest their decade long investment at a profitable price. Transaction volume (excluding bulk sales) in the secondary market grew by 40.1% y\u2010o\u2010y in 2006 and 54.4% in 2007 where it peaked with a total of 4,848 transactions, according to URA. Foreign Ownership In general, the private landed residential market can be divided into 3 main classes, namely, Good Class Bungalows (GCB), conventional landed units and strata landed units. Unlike non\u2010landed properties, foreigners are not allowed to purchase landed properties (restricted residential property under the Residential Property Act) with two main exceptions, (1) landed units located in Sentosa Cove, in which approval from the authority is still required and (2) strata landed units built within a nonlanded development that has been accorded Condominium status. Foreigners who are interested to buy landed properties beyond the two exceptions can seek approval from the Singapore Land Dealings (Approval) Unit if they are permanent residents. The applicant would need to go through a stringent screening process and fulfill criteria such as having significant contributions to Singapore\u2019s economy. Successful candidates are then entitled to purchase only 1 landed home in Singapore slated for their own occupancy. Appeal of Landed Housings The landed segment of the private residential market is mainly driven by home\u2010stayers\u2019 penchant to own a landed house, which is often associated with prestige and exclusivity. In addition, the scarcity of land in the second most densely populated country in the world heightens the appeal and intrinsic value of landed housing in Singapore. As Singapore continues to grow its population from the current 5.4m to the estimated 6.9m in 2030, the need to optimise and intensify land usage will translate to a declining proportion of landed housings in Singapore, adding on to its appeal (Figure 2). Landed housings are less susceptible to speculative purchases due to its high premium, which raises the entry bar. The restriction imposed on foreigners acts as a safety net to prevent speculative bubbles from arising as the inflow of \u2018hot money\u2019 brought about by foreign investors will have limited impact on this segment of the property market. A good proportion of landed units are bought for owner occupation as seen from the significantly higher occupancy rate and low rental volume relative to nonlanded units (Figures 3 and 4). Occupancy rate of landed housings is also observed to be relatively more stable. However, as the segment sees low volume, average prices can fluctuate widely in the short to medium term if market conditions turn unfavourable. The ability to tide through difficult period is essential to getting the most out of the segment, financially speaking. Recent Trends The private residential market reached its pinnacle in 3Q13 where the landed segment appreciated 87.8% since its last trough in 2Q19 and 27% peak to\u2010peak since its previous historical high in 2Q96 whereas its non\u2010landed counterpart grew by 62.3% and 19.2% respectively during the same period. Sales in the landed segment, however, remained feeble with transaction volume falling by 55.7% y\u2010o\u2010y to only 1,359 transactions in 2013, the lowest since 1995. The significant drop in sales in 2H13 (Table 2) may be inherent to the introduction of total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) introduced in 3Q13, where the tighter financing rules may have a direct impact on one\u2019s buying power. A collective decline in prices across all landed types, the first since 2Q09, observed in 4Q13 may hint at a price correction in the landed segment as we move towards a buyer\u2019s market. Freehold versus Leasehold Freehold landed properties (including 999\u2010year) have been shown to be more resilient. In terms of capital appreciation, freehold landed properties performed better than leasehold landed properties (Figure 4) with price growth of 96.5% (nearly doubled) and 74.1% respectively from 2Q09 to 4Q13. This is also evident from the widening gap between median transaction price for freehold landed terrace and median transaction price for leasehold landed terrace (Figure 5). Strata Landed Unlike conventional landed housings, owners of strata landed do not actually own the land title but rather the strata title of their landed units. Similar to high\u2010rise developments, strata\u2010titled cluster housings/townhouses get to enjoy communal facilities where owners collectively maintain by paying a fee monthly. Another key difference is that a landed unit can be rebuilt whereas a strata\u2010titled landed unit cannot be rebuilt on its own. As described previously, foreigners are generally not allowed to own landed properties with two main exceptions. Purchasing a strata\u2010titled landed unit within a development with Condominium status is the only option where approval is not required. However, this avenue has been tightened in 2012 after URA announced that it will no longer grant condominium status to new high\u2010rise developments that comprise strata\u2010landed units, thus limiting the number of such developments available. We believe this category of landed properties will do well given that it remains the only avenue where foreigners are able to purchase without approval. In fact, about 75% of the total buyers of landed units in this category are foreigners based on new projects launched since 2007 (Table 3). Conclusion A decreasing proportion of landed housing bodes well for the segment. The 1H2014 GLS Confirmed List is expected to yield more than 4,600 new non\u2010landed units but not any landed units. Similarly, the 1H2014 GLS Reserve List does not have any landed residential sites. In areas where the government still has a stockpile of vacant sites such as Sengkang and Punggol, the current supply of landed units is not expected to increase in the future (except for cases where existing landed units are collectively purchased and developed into more units), as all of the residential sites have been set aside for high\u2010rise developments, based on details from the Draft Master Plan 2013. Landed properties may not be the best segment to invest if a quick return is expected. Due to its high price tag, rental yield is generally unattractively low. In addition, due to the low transaction volume, average prices can fluctuate widely so speculators can be caught wrong\u2010footed should market conditions turn unfavourable quickly. However, due to its increasing scarcity, we believe the segment remains fundamentally attractive in the long run. Strata Landed in High-rise"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

He also asked the government to reverse its land divestment policy, which he deems a key reason behind high industrial rents.Companies are facing a \"triple whammy\" of rising rents and utility bills, growing wage costs, and a shortage of workers, said Mr Singh, himself a businessman. And this \"chronic\" cost issue does not affect SMEs alone. \"The top management of some large MNCs here ... have expressed their serious concerns about the unrelenting increases of the cost of doing business coupled with the unavailability of workers,\" he said.Iskandar's industrial parks are a \"huge threat\", he said. If Singapore's SMEs are forced to move to Johor, MNCs may follow their SME suppliers and subcontractors. \"The exodus may be larger than we imagine ... We risk hollowing out our economy in the future, and I would like to sound an alarm that we are close to the tipping point.\"His response to the Budget was more strongly worded than that of business associations, most of whom were relieved at the absence of additional across-the-board foreign manpower curbs and glad at the extension of the Productivity and Innovation Credit. Though he acknowledged that PIC and PIC+ would help with topline revenues growth, Mr Singh said: \"We are just trying to do too many things too fast, and this is hurting many companies.\"Both he and nominated MP R Dhinakaran, who is also managing director of Jay Gee Group, pointed to rising industrial and commercial rents as a key culprit of the high costs of doing business in Singapore.Citing Association of Small and Medium Enterprises president Kurt Wee's comment at BT's Budget Roundtable that rents rise as much as three-fold when leases are renewed, Mr Dhinakaran said: \"In this economic climate, rental increases of this magnitude will be fatal for a large number of SMEs.\"Both Mr Singh and Mr Dhinakaran also linked the high rental costs to the government's land divestment policy. \"JTC was a landlord for 18 per cent of industrial property some 10 years ago, but today manages only 3 per cent of the market. This is a huge shift, and the government lost the ability to influence rental prices resulting in developers and investors making the money,\" said Mr Singh.\"We have to reverse this policy, even if it means the government having to buy back some of the Reits. In any case, the biggest Reit players are government-linked entities like Mapletree and CapitaLand,\" he added.Denise Phua (Moulmein-Kallang) felt that certain cost increases - the restoration of CPF contribution rates for older workers, higher progressive wages for low-income earners and cost hikes due to tighter low-skilled foreign manpower policies - are justified, with \"strong rationale\".But she also said that business rents need \"the touch of the State\", and asked the government to consider \"cooling measures, especially for business rents\".Rents are a challenge for micro-enterprises in the creative industries too, said nominated MP Janice Koh. \"Their operations are often too small or too labour-intensive to benefit from automation, and they rarely have sufficient upfront capital or cashflow to upgrade and expand,\" she added, citing how an independent boutique, stocking designed-in-Singapore fashion and accessories, closed down due to a steep rise in rents.\"A dollar spent on a local product goes further than one spent on an import,\" Ms Koh added, proposing \"cluster\" housing for creative enterprises in unused government buildings or conserved spaces at affordable or low rents.Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang) suggested that productivity transformation for micro-enterprises can be done in clusters too, for instance, by connecting retail shops and food centres with shared services, or e-payment service providers. \"One retail shop on its own may not find automation useful without scale. But a business community put together may find automation or shared services useful in lowering their business costs and enhancing customer experience,\" he said.Citing evidence of the business community's struggles - cleaning contractors unable to hire workers and restaurants closing down or downsizing because of the same - Arthur Fong (West Coast) urged the government to stay vigilant over Singapore's global competitiveness.Cleaning and F&B are examples, however, of Singapore's less productive sectors. These and sectors such as construction, security and retail have been hiring more workers and thus continue to pull down Singapore's overall labour productivity growth, said Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Lim Swee Say.This is why Singapore's labour productivity was flat last year, a cautionary sign that despite \"healthy signs that the economy is shifting to a new trend ... we are not full steam ahead yet\", said Mr Lim. Singapore thus needs a \"greater and broader sense of urgency\" in its productivity efforts, he said."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Analysts expect MRT ridership numbers to grow 7 percent in the 2009 financial year, so why are people switching from private cars and taxis to public transport? Last year, we launched the Go Green with SMRT promotion where we gave away free travel on SMRT trains and buses as prizes to encourage more people to choose public transport as a green mode of travel.Our post-campaign studies showed that some of our customers switched from cars to public transport because they find it a cost-effective, eco-friendly option.Last years spike in ridership numbers were the result of the 2007 taxi fare increase, and drivers switching from private cars to public transport due to higher costs of driving cars.The shift in support of public transport is good for Singapore and for the environment, as it reduces congestion on the roads, cuts down pollution and allows people to travel more efficiently. Q. SMRT added 700 trips in May 2008 to cut the waiting times for trains before and after peak hours. But shouldnt SMRT be adding more trips in the peak times instead? Currently, the 22 year-old system is being operated at its optimum level. During peak hours, the maximum number of trains are deployed for service at system-capable shortest frequency.Even during off-peak hours we are running at optimum level with longer waiting times as we have to withdraw some trains to return to our depots for maintenance works so as to ensure system safety and reliability.With the spike last year, the government and SMRT are working together closely to bring forward the improvement works to the system infrastructure and the purchase of new trains to improve frequency. Q. In January 2008, SMRT was fined S$387,176 for a train service disruption between Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah that lasted for seven hours, so what happened and how did the disruption affected SMRTs earnings? The incident occurred during non-operation hours, while our staff were doing maintenance works.We were extremely careful and meticulous in the retrieval of the damaged equipment, to prevent any damage to the track.Our decision to take extreme care in the retrieval process which resulted in the seven-hour service stoppage was at the expense of a shorter recovery, as we did not want to compromise our system and the safety of our passengers.In reviewing the incident we found that our procedures remain relevant and robust, and the incident occurred solely as a result of non-compliance by staff. We continue to seek improvements so as to deliver safe, efficient and affordable service. Q. The Circle Line will open with stage 3 in the middle of 2009. But when will the project be finished?Phase 3 of Circle Line will open 30 May, followed by Phrases 2, 1, 4 and 5. The other stages are at various stages of completion and will open from 2010 onwards. Q. Analysts say that when the Circle Line is fully ramped up, after tax profit should increase by at least S$15 million? But dont you think this is a bit of a stretch?We are confident that the convenience of the Circle Line will draw more commuters. Q. The Land Transport Authority will undertake centralised bus planning in 2009, so what will change and how will SMRTs bus division be affected?LTAs central bus planning initiative will enhance bus services with optimal routing and eliminate duplication.It will allow more operators to compete in the bus service sector. And it is a good opportunity to grow our bus business, which is currently limited to the North and North-West areas. Q. How is SMRT dealing with the Ministry of Transports new operating standards, the liberalisation of bus routes and the construction of new lines?The new initiatives open up a new world of possibilities for SMRT. Firstly, the metro system will double and SMRT is well-positioned to compete for these new lines as we have proven to be the most cost-efficient metro in the world while also delivering the best service standards. Q. SMRT is planning to acquire Chinas Zona Transportation, so what other plans does SMRT have for acquisitions and expansion?In addition to our current negotiation to acquire Zona, we have also been successful as part of a consortium in winning a coveted 10-year media contract in late December 2008, to plan the advertising space, attend to design, operation and marketing of media services for the Dubai Metro. Q. Analysts say that a two percent fare increase is expected to help SMRT mitigate the impact of rising operating costs. But are higher energy and staff costs grounds enough to allow SMRT to increase its fares by 2 percent?As evidenced in the past year, SMRT as been focused on cost management while introducing innovative initiatives to increase income, by encouraging and incentivising an increase in ridership and growing revenue through the development of retail and media spaces.We have been investing in improvements to our advertising and retail assets, to increase income from them. Q. SMRTs dividend policy suggests that it must pay at least 60 percent of net profit and at least maintain the level of dividend in absolute terms. The 2008 dividend payout was 6.25 cents, so what dividend payout do you think SMRT can support in 2009?SMRT is committed to give fair returns to our shareholders. Q. Analysts say that taxi fares will be increasingly priced as premium products and that taxi fares are set to be raised in the future instead of being lowered. So what do you have to say about that?Taxis are premium, point-to-point transport service options for commuters.Fares are an important factor to a drivers income and hence it would determine the viability of driving as a career. Successful drivers attract other drivers to the industry, and extremely low fares will not benefit commuters as there will be insufficient drivers interested to remain in the industry, compromising the availability of taxis to commuters. Q. Newer taxi models are obviously in greater demand by drivers. So how successful has SMRT been in converting its existing drivers onto the newer taxi models which could potentially fetch higher rental rates? Various taxi models serve different needs from the drivers and commuters point of view.SMRT has been successfully opening up various niche markets as we have seen very strong responses to our Chrysler, Ssyanyong SPACE and SMRT Eco green taxis."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It was launched at an average price of $900 psf.According to HSR, this development could possibly be one of the last high-end condominium offerings in this area to be sold, on average, under the thousand-dollar psf mark this year.Mr Alan Tan, Head of Local Projects for HSR International Realtors said: As Government Land Sales (GLS) bids for city fringe residential land parcels l crossed $1,100 psf per plot ratio (the most recent being at Kim Tian Road, was priced at $1,162 per plot ratio), it is inevitable that the prices of future residential projects would be launched at even higher price points in line with an overall increase in property prices.Head of Research for HSR Property Consultants, Ms. Elaine Chow found evidence that as at May 2, 2013, the median sales price for some new sales and sub-sales projects in Pasir Ris have already exceeded the $1,000 psf benchmark.According to URA, the Property Price Index of Uncompleted Non-Landed Residential Properties in Outside Central Region (OCR) has increased by around 4% y-o-y both in Q1 2012 and in Q1 2013, and by an average of 7% for the past five years and has already crossed the average, $1,000 psf selling mark.Specifically in Pasir Ris, HSR notes that uncompleted residential projects saw median price increases of 7% y-o-y in Q1 2012 and 12% y-o-y in Q1 2013.We have conservatively assumed (in tandem with an economic outlook) that there will be a 2% to 5% increase in prices on a y-o-y basis. But even with this estimate, the median price for new private residential projects in Pasir Ris will certainly breach the $1,000 psf by end-2013, if not earlier.Sizes range from 432 sq ft for a studio to 2,446 sq ft for a five-bedroom duplex penthouse.According to HSR, the development is conceptualized around an idyllic tropical resort style living theme, and is complemented with terraced landscape, an infinity-edge pool, floating cabanas, water jet plaza, gymnasium tennis court and two impressive size pools of 50 and 30 metres."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The building features contiguous floor plates of up to 80,000 square feet per floor, the largest of its kind in Singapore.Changi City is a 50:50 joint-venture development by Ascendas and FCL. The 4.7-hectare development embodies the live-work-play concept, seamlessly integrating business spaces in ONE@Changi City; retail, F&B and entertainment operations in Changi City Point mall and a hotel residence at Capri By Fraser, all in one location.Changi City Point is managed by FCL, and was opened in November 2011. The 207,000 sq ft mall (net lettable area), which is the first within a business park, has seen its shopper traffic increase, from half a million a month since end-2011, to almost a million a month now. Capri By Fraser, which is managed by Frasers Hospitality, is FCLs first hotel residence, which opened its doors in September last year. It currently enjoys an average occupancy of about 85%.According to its developers, \"the opening of ONE@Changi City heralds the completion of Changi City as one of Singapores largest integrated community within a business park. It represents a vibrant economic hub with attractive features in a suburban location to cater to the expectations of the new generation workforce, while keeping costs affordable for corporations.\"In 2012, Changi City achieved international recognition as a Highly Commended Mixed-Use Development at the Asia Pacific Property Awards.Mr Manohar Khiatani, President & CEO of Ascendas Group, said: Ascendas is excited to be part of Singapores largest integrated business park development merging high-quality business space with retail and hospitality elements. The successful completion of Changi City sets a new benchmark for business park development in Singapore. It demonstrates the added value that a vibrant, integrated community can bring to businesses. This flagship project also epitomises the innovative customer-centric solutions that Ascendas always strives to provide to our valued customers.Mr Lim Ee Seng, Group CEO of Frasers Centrepoint Limited, said: The completion of this integrated hub fulfills a shared vision between Ascendas and Frasers Centrepoint to develop a landmark business park. At Changi City, we have created an inspiring oasis in the midst of an urban jungle, and successfully integrated the live-work-play concept. This has led to the tremendous growth in visitorship and a high demand for our business and hospitality spaces, which bears a strong testimony to the strategic fit of two bestin-class developers and managers.With the Singapore Governments plan to decentralise economic activities outside the city area, developers expect the completion of ONE@Changi City is to draw renewed interest in Changi Business Park from companies seeking alternative spaces to the new central business district.Changi City is the latest addition to a suite of iconic integrated projects pioneered by Ascendas, which includes the International Tech Park Bangalore in India, Dalian Ascendas IT Park and Ascendas OneHub GKC in China."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Despite talk of a bubble, investors unwilling to jump onto the buyers' bandwagon can still take bets on property developers themselves.Jubilee Industries Holdings - formerly loss-making plastic injection mould producer JLJ Holdings - appears poised to be the latest intriguing Iskandar play on Singapore Exchange.A proposed reverse takeover (RTO) announced in mid-October will see Singaporean businessman Dennis Ng inject Tenderside Ventures, a subsidiary of his Malaysian property development company Jewelstone Properties, into Catalyst-quoted Jubilee.The deal gives a well-connected and established family a foothold in a listed entity in Singapore.Mr Ng is executive director of United Malayan Land (UMLand), of which his father, Ng Eng Tee, is deputy chairman and also executive director.UMLand, a Johor-based property developer with decades of track record, was an associate company of property giant CapitaLand and listed on Bursa Malaysia. It was privatised last year by the elder Mr Ng and his business partner, Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary, a well-connected bumiputera entrepreneur who is said to have close relationship with the current Malaysian political leadership. UMLand also has an undeveloped land bank of about 810 hectares in Johor, according to media reports.Tenderside will be acquired by Jubilee for RM150 million (S$59 million) through an issue of new Jubilee shares to Jewelstone. The deal, which will boost Jubilee's issued shares to around 508 million, will result in Tenderside gaining a 54 per cent stake in Jubilee.Rising condo pricesAnd here's where it gets interesting.Tenderside owns a 60 per cent stake in Viridea Lakeside Sdn Bhd. Viridea will acquire the Viridea @ Medini Lakeside project in Johor on roughly three hectares of land. For comparison, the Medini area comprises 890 hectares of land. The estimated gross development value of the mostly residential project, or what it can be sold for when completed, is RM800 million. Out of that, a profit before tax of RM300 million is expected to be generated, out of which 60 per cent or RM180 million will be guaranteed to Jubilee.This guaranteed profit before tax works out to about 14 cents a share.Investors and developers, however, have some concerns about Iskandar plays.Numerous aggressive launches of high-rise condominiums have pushed prices to Kuala Lumpur property levels.On Oct 25, the Malaysian government's budget included measures to cool the property market that is fast rising out of the reach of ordinary Malaysians.Notably, a 30 per cent real property gains tax will be levied on gains on property disposed within five years. The minimum price for foreigners to buy a Malaysian property will also go up to RM1 million from RM500,000.Developers in Medini, however, have a unique advantage.The area is a special zone in Iskandar that is exempt from price caps and bumiputera quotas which can affect developer profits - a deal introduced several years ago to attract foreign investment. Developers there also enjoy various income tax incentives.Medini is also a short 10-minute drive from the Second Link connecting Johor to Singapore, so investors who prefer to live there have quick and convenient access to the Republic.Iskandar's planners envisage Medini to be a commercial and business district, with malls, offices, high-end homes and a hospital. Theme park Legoland is located just a stone's throw away.Not surprisingly, properties there have been selling like hot cakes. In June, Afiniti Residences, a 147-unit wellness themed condominium project that is a joint venture between Temasek Holdings and counterpart Khazanah Nasional, was sold out on launch day. Selling prices for the project, located beside Legoland, were RM850 to RM1,000 per square foot.How much might Jubilee be worth?The company's last reported net asset value by end-June was 19.6 cents, before the completion of a deal that saw former Novena Holdings CEO Toh Soon Huat lead a group of investors to inject $15 million into the company.RTO processMr Toh and company bought in at 15.4 cents a share then. On Oct 29, he bought another 750,000 shares at an average price of 17.7 cents.Meanwhile, the company placed out shares to Jewelstone at 22 cents each.Currently, the company is trading at around 17 to 18 cents. Support might be found around the 15 cents level that Mr Toh originally bought in for, giving opportunities to investors if prices fall to or below that.Investors, however, have to note that the RTO process usually takes around half a year, and there is never a guarantee that any takeover will go through.Any investment in Jubilee - or in similar Iskandar developer plays such as Rowsley and Albedo - is also a bet on the long-term economic sustainability and political stability of the Iskandar region. Sentiment in Iskandar property might already be affected after Malaysia's latest budget measures. Also, the next few years could see more supply come up on both sides of the Causeway. Then there is the prospect of a potential tightening of US monetary policy.That said, Medini enjoys special exemptions from the Malaysian authorities.If and when the RTO goes through, Jubilee will need to build and sell its residential project fast.Although the company could be vulnerable to short-term fluctuations in share prices in the event of a property market downturn, with the UMLand pedigree behind it, Jubilee is a long-term play. This is a company worth watching in the years to come."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

What is not usually allowed is running a business out of a home.Small-scale businesses can be run out of homes only if owners register for the \"home-office scheme\".The business must meet guidelines such as not hiring more than two foreign employees.The URA strongly urged developers to insert a clause stating the approved use of the property in the Sale and Purchase Agreement.As for all office properties - even if marketed as Soho units - they are not meant for residential use.Developers should not give a different impression, and \"should refrain from using the term 'Soho' for office developments in any of their advertisements\".Far East Organization said it is not marketing any commercial developments under its dedicated 'SO/HO' brand at the moment.\"We support the greater clarity on the use of the 'SOHO' term as set out in the latest circular by the URA,\" said executive director of property services Chng Kiong Huat.He added that Far East has \"made it a point to highlight\" that buyers must comply with regulations if they want to use their residential unit as a home-office.A call for such clarity was made in April when Mr Daniel Choy wrote to The Straits Times' Forum page, saying the term 'Soho' confuses potential buyers.His job as a real estate agent is made harder by such confusion, he told The Straits Times yesterday.He would like developers to be barred from using the term.Mr Ku sees the circular as aiming \"to make our developers a little more disciplined\" and raise awareness among agents. But he doubts it will clear the air: \"I think the confusion will still go on because there aren't any real punitive measures.\"The URA also said developers should \"provide estate agents with accurate information\".Regardless of how projects are marketed, agents should be clear on the facts, said Mr Jeffhery Foo, president of the Institute of Estate Agents, Singapore: \"There is an onus on us to make such clarifications upfront.\"janiceh@sph.com.sgJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

(see infographic)HDB said on Tuesday that it was expanding the coverage of its resale price index (RPI) to all towns and flat models, having excluded 12 towns in the past. It is also adopting a new method to compute the RPI called the \"stratified hedonic regression\" method, which it says is better able to screen out \"noises\" in measuring price changes.Other government agencies that track property prices, namely the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and JTC, could soon be making changes to their respective property price indices too.A JTC spokeswoman told BT that it is working on a revised method to compute its industrial price and rental indices to \"better reflect market trends\" and will reveal more details next month. URA disclosed last week that it was reviewing the need to revise its private residential property price index (PPI). Some market watchers believe that URA is also reviewing price indices for commercial properties.HDB's move to change its computation of the quarterly RPI is itself a response to significant market changes that have taken place since the last revision in 2002. In recent years, a wider range of flats have been transacted, more resales took place in newer towns and there is now greater age variance across resale flats, Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan has flagged.Starting from the fourth quarter, HDB will include all towns and flat models in the RPI. It had previously excluded newer towns such as Sengkang, Punggol and Sembawang.Market watchers were, however, surprised yesterday that even popular towns such as Bishan, Queenstown, Marine Parade and Clementi were previously excluded in the RPI.\"Obviously, including all the towns will provide a fairer and better representation of HDB resale market,\" said PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail.Mature estates such as Bishan, Queenstown and Marine Parade tend to have greater demand, fetching the highest cash-over-valuations in the past, he pointed out. A few HDB executive maisonettes were transacted at a record S$1 million in Bishan and Queenstown.According to HDB, the 12 excluded towns made up less than 30 per cent of all resale transactions in recent years; market watchers felt however that this is significant especially when market volumes come down.But a back-testing of the new approach by HDB found no deviation in the overall price trend compared to the previous method, though resale prices would have fallen more over the past three quarters based on the revised approach. In the third quarter, the revised RPI would have fallen 1.8 per cent, compared to 1.7 per cent using the older approach.Property consultants believe that this is due to newer towns being included, as they typically face weaker demand. Now, even the popular towns such as Bishan where flats are more pricey have been hit by the lending curb on home buyers, Mr Ismail said.To compute the index, HDB is switching to \"stratified hedonic regression\", which it says allows for quality control at the broader level compared to the current \"stratification\" method. As a general principle, housing units are heterogeneous; to measure actual price changes over time, their quality differences have to be controlled to make fair \"apple- to-apple\" comparisons.Previously, HDB sorted resale transactions by flat types, models and regions and derived the index by aggregating the average prices of the segments, each weighted based on a 12-quarter moving average of transaction volumes. But this means that within each segment, effects on price changes due to differences in flat attributes, such as age and floor level, were not stripped out.The new method sorts resale transactions by flat types (three-room, four-room etc) and computes their average price changes over time using regression analysis. These price changes are then aggregated using fixed weights (based on five quarters of transacted values) to get the overall index. This hedonic regression is able to control for the differences in housing attributes such as location, proximity to facilities or amenities, age or floor level. Even factors such as distance to MRT stations and primary schools are accounted for.To avoid user confusion, past values of the resale price index will not be re-calculated using the new method, HDB said. But the RPI's base period will be changed from Q4 1998 to Q1 2009, the index's most recent trough.ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim noted that for the academics and analysts, this revised index will be a more accurate representation of the market, \"just like water has been made more pure\".\"But to the layman, it does not really make a difference,\" he said. \"They will look at the index for the general market direction. For pricing indication, most of them will be looking at the recent transaction information that HDB publishes on its website, which is more relevant when it comes to pricing a flat to be sold or making an offer on a flat to be purchased.\"Century 21 Singapore CEO Ku Swee Yong felt, however, that home buyers in towns such as Bishan and Marine Parade might have felt that they were making decisions on data that was not complete. \"We need at least next five quarters to see if the revised index is good and reflecting market situation,\" he said.Some property consultants have hoped to see sub-indices for mature and non-mature HDB estates, similar to how URA slices sub-indices for different regions.HDB explained that for simplicity, it publishes one composite price index. \"There are individual flat transactions publicised daily in the HDB InfoWEB to give a good sense of the current prices,\" it said.A team from HDB have worked on the index review over the past one year with a consultant from NUS Department of Real Estate, associate professor Lum Sau Kim. She had earlier led the launch of the NUS Singapore Residential Price Index that also uses hedonic regression.Globally, many private and official agencies have started reviewing their property price indices amid efforts by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, to harmonise official house price indices across jurisdictions.The hedonic regression method has increasingly been used to compute national level indices, with France, Finland and Japan among countries that have adopted this method. Official statistical agencies in Australia and the UK are also developing such indices."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

According to a representative from Devo Design, most offices focus on branding walls or specific features to spruce up design intent and activity when sculpting the office space. But Acronis rebelled in a holistic communal intent by using their corporate color a deep blue, not dull but strong Pantone color to another level. It applies an overdosing method which the representative describes as ironically fun and introspective. Our objective was to create an open plan office, that is effective in every spectrum crucial for ACRONISs requirements, which we had collaborated with the ACRONIS team right from day one.

Almost intoxicated in blue during design development, little did everyone realize it will be a revelation transient to a deeper level of happiness for an employee-centric workplace, says the representative.The Acronis team also describes that seeing from ACRONIS Blue glasses creates another genre of office experience for their daily activities. The secondary stimulants were playing around with lighting and intended activity based propos/furniture that bonds with the above idea.Devo Design team explains that when natural light fuses into the work area, the office is less glaring and calming on sleepy sticky afternoons - the deep tone colour encapsulates the wall/floor, providing a strong robust feeling for any human walking around the office, almost like a walking into blue space matrix movie forward. This, he says, allows for employees to keep energy levels consistent throughout the working day.The new Acronis HQ boasts of 7eleven amenities in the pantry, with more space allotted for beverages than for food staples since employees are required to hydrate more every 1-2 hours a common activity but highly essential to keep employees healthy while on the move.Acronis provides backup solutions for desktop, server, virtual and cloud environments as well as file sharing and sync solutions for mobile devices. Now returning to its roots, Acronis considers boosting its research and development activities in Singapore as part of the companys global strategy.Serguei Beloussov, CEO and founder of Acronis, explains that they chose to set up their international headquarters in Singapore because the city is a convenient location for international technology businesses. Singapore is also well connected to the rest of the world; more than 50% of worlds population and economy is in the distance of 8-hours flight from here. Singapore serves as a business and technology hub in Asia, and this is important for us, as we believe that in 5 years more than 50% of Acronis revenue will come from Asia. It is also important that Singapore is a neutral country, and it is a good place for a truly global company. Calling for newly opened, renovated and/or furnished company offices.

But whether you're directly placing your resume or using recruitment agencies, the end of the year may be the best time to do it, according to recent studies and trends. CompetitionAccording to MasterCard Intelligence, international outbound leisure travel trips by Singaporean residents are estimated at 8.7 million in 2014, and are forecasted to grow by an average of 5.3% per year to reach 11.8 million trips by 2020.Total outbound trips will grow about three times faster than total household growth (5.3% versus 1.7%) over the forecast period resulting in a ratio of outbound trips to households that is projected to reach 696% in 2020 from 566.1% in 2014.Singaporean households have the highest ratio of outbound trips to households among the 14 Asia/Pacific markets. The lack of domestic tourism is possibly a strong reason for such high ratios.Combine that with yearend where everyone attempts to clear their leave or risk forfeiture, you are going to get many people putting work (or job search) aside. And that is why it's in your best interest to take advantage of this and start your job hunting.Given the low competition you'll be facing this time of year, there's good reason to believe that you'll have better odds at getting the career you want. What's more employers will most likely take into account that you went through the trouble of applying during the holiday season, giving you an extra advantage from your commitment. Job OpeningsIn Singapore there is an Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) and it is commonly known as the 13th month payment. It is a single annual payment to employees that supplements the total amount of annual wage earned by them.Although not mandated, most companies in Singapore will provide for that in order to maintain competitiveness with the civil service. In addition, you may also be getting your yearend bonus together with AWS.Add that all up, the bonus can be significant in value and people hold off quitting their job until they get that bonus. Employers then face staff shortages they need to fix before the New Year starts.Even more relevant is that most employers will get an overview on available funds at the end of the year, which means they might decide to create new jobs for the coming year having your resume at their disposal will definitely increase the odds of you landing the job or recruitment agencies finding one for you.Last, but not least, some companies or employers might seek out additional help on a temporary basis for the holidays. Retailers especially might start looking for some additional workers to match the season demand, and you can take advantage of these opportunities as they usually lead to other permanent careers."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

He had taken seven years instead of four to get his O levels, and had no idea what he wanted out of life.Still, the rejection rankled and the youth vowed he would prove her wrong one day.Two decades and countless setbacks later, Mr Soon, 46, now owns Kim Guan Guan, a thriving coffee business with an annual turnover of $7 million.Home is a swish condominium apartment in Bishan, and the father of four has also invested in a few properties, including two warehouses and a commercial office unit.He is happy with what he has achieved but wishes he had had a surer sense of himself when he was younger. \"I might have done better,\" he says in Mandarin.The complacency of his earlier years, he says, might have had something to do with being the youngest of three children of a businessman and a housewife. His father ran a stationery and paint shop, and the family lived in a house in the Thomson area. \"Life was quite comfortable and being the youngest, I was quite sheltered. My mother spoilt me,\" he admits with a laugh.Books and exams, he says ruefully, were not quite his cup of tea.\"I had to repeat my Secondary 1 and Secondary 3,\" says the Normal stream student of the now defunct Pei Dao Secondary School in Kim Keat Lane.\"I tried but I just couldn't retain anything I studied. I just felt very defeated and developed an inferiority complex.\"However, he takes great pains to stress, he was not a bad sort. \"I might not have liked studying but I didn't join any gangs or steal. Even when I played truant, I would stay at home, not make trouble outside.\"He served his national service with the police force and was based at the Toa Payoh Police Station. Suicide, murder, gang fights - he saw them all in the two years he was a man in blue.He nearly lost his life in a macabre accident too when he was asked to refill some fire extinguishers in Jurong. As there were no other vehicles available, he was given a police hearse to make the trip.The bizarre accident happened along Jurong Town Hall Road.\"I saw a stationary lorry ahead but I ploughed my vehicle into it. I don't know why I couldn't or didn't stop,\" he says.The front of the vehicle was smashed in, trapping him. \"The handbrake wedged itself through my left shin,\" he says, lifting his left trouser leg to reveal a nasty 20cm scar.A crane had to be called to pull the front of the hearse away before he could be freed, and he needed surgery for his injuries.\"I told myself I couldn't die. I had not got married yet, or had children, or found a career. I needed to prove my former girlfriend wrong,\" recalls Mr Soon, who could not walk for three months after the accident.After national service, a cousin invited him to start a coffee business. He knew nothing about coffee and did not even drink it. \"But my cousin said there were so many coffee shops so there would be a lot of business,\" he recalls.The two of them put in $13,000 each to start Kim Guan Guan. He got a loan from his reluctant father.\"He nagged but I said I needed to try, otherwise I wouldn't know if I would succeed. The nagging went on for 10 years, because I had nothing to show for it,\" he says with a laugh.The cousins bought a delivery van and started business with just a table in a relative's shop.The trade was more competitive than they imagined, and business was slow.It did not help, he admits candidly, that he did not put his heart and soul into the business. \"I was not serious enough. I relied on my cousin. He did everything, I just made the deliveries.\"Reality bit hard when his cousin decided to call it a day two years later. Mr Soon bought over the latter's share for $50,000. \"I didn't have the cash so he took one of the two vans we had, and I promised to pay the rest in monthly instalments of $2,000,\" he says.The idea of throwing in the towel crossed his mind too. \"But I asked myself, 'If I give up now, does that mean I will always give up in life? How will I live my life? What can I do? Become a delivery man, earn $1,600 a month?'\"Carrying on meant having to shoulder a debt of more than $100,000. \"But I just had to figure out how to continue.\"Boy, was there a lot of figuring out to do. He had to start almost from scratch. \"I realised how young and irresponsible I had been. I hadn't learnt anything. I didn't even know how coffee was made, where it was grown,\" he says.His ignorance was not the only thing working against him.\"Suppliers and customers didn't trust me. They asked me where my cousin was; they said they would not do business with me if he wasn't around.\"There were countless sleepless nights. Competitors and even relatives thought he would fail.\"I'd go to coffee shops and make coffee and wash cups for the owners until they would talk to me,\" he says. \"Customers my competitors did not want, I would take. It was my only way of getting a leg in the door and building a customer base which I needed badly.\"To earn more, he even became a coolie for a competitor once, hauling 10 60kg coffee bags up two floors in a coffee shop, at $10 a bag.\"I'm lucky my family did not depend on me; no one needed me to look after them. I also did not smoke, drink or socialise so it was enough for me to survive on,\" says the affable businessman who gave himself a monthly salary of $500 for a few years.That proved to be a period of self-reflection.\"Why were my competitors doing well? Why was I losing so badly? Was my business model wrong? Was it the way I communicated? Was I not sincere enough? I tried to work out answers to all these questions,\" says Mr Soon, who took more than five years to clear his debts.His first breakthrough came in 1993 when he partnered another relative to start a coffee roasting facility, which gave him not only an added source of income but also allowed him to control the quality of his beans.Two years later, he borrowed from banks and a tontine to raise $220,000 to take over a unit at Defu Lane so that he would have a proper base for his operations. A tontine is an informal micro-financing scheme; members make regular contributions to a common pool and loans are given out to those who make the highest bid.In the meantime, he found love. He married Ms Wendy Lee, a Temasek Polytechnic business graduate, in 1996. She and his older sister Mandy soon came on board to help him run the operation.\"I couldn't have done it without my wife. She helped to put in a lot of systems and streamline the operations,\" he says.Monthly sales grew to more than $100,000 - five times more than when he first took over. But just when he thought he was getting into a groove, his relative decided to quit their partnership.Desperate to keep the business going, he initially turned to competitors. \"They said, 'Sure, I can give you our beans to roast but you have to give me two months credit and also a lower price.' They were using me to press roasting prices down.\"He decided to go directly to the coffee shops. \"I reckoned I might as well go to the front line. I told them I'd give them the best roasted beans at the best price. I'd also do the roasting for those who had their own beans. That way, I could control the price and I collected cash straight away.\"It worked. He now roasts 40 tonnes of beans a month for coffee shops, more than 13 times the amount from other coffee traders.With his business finally humming, he started thinking about sharpening his competitive edge.In 2003, he started packing his coffee - from 200g to 4.5kg - in aluminium foil bags instead of the traditional tins. The method is more hygienic, preserves the fragrance of the coffee better, and makes brewing the perfect cup a breeze.\"You just need 2.2ml of water for a 200g bag, very easy. The quality is constant,\" he says.He chatted with cantankerous coffee brewers who were resistant to the idea, and managed to convince them that his new packaging made for a fresher, more fragrant cup of coffee.\"I'd tell them, 'If people come and say the coffee you brew is good, won't you feel proud?'\"This packaging innovation took his business to the next level, increasing sales from less than $200,000 to more than $500,000 a month.He also launched his own brand of Guan's Coffee and Tea in 2005, which he promotes on radio and at trade shows and company carnivals.\"Customers order by phone. It is a small home delivery business which we do because we are passionate about traditional local coffee and want to promote it. It's freshly packed, with no chemicals added,\" he says, adding they sell about 3,000 boxes a month.There are no plans to have the range stocked by supermarkets.\"The whole process needs a lot of supervision and I want every bag to be fresh,\" he explains.His father, who died two years ago, lived to see him thrive and once told a friend how proud he was of his youngest son's success.Unlike the days when few customers had faith in him, Mr Soon is now well-known for his pride in his products. He makes daily visits to coffee shops to taste their brews and when he finds them lacking, he has been known to roll up his sleeves to show how it should be done.\"Coffee is the most important item for any coffee shop; it is also their lifeline. You need passion to make a good cup of coffee. It can't be just about money. If it is, the more you do it, the less good it is.\"Businessman Vincent Lim, 46, who was Mr Soon's secondary schoolmate, says: \"He's different from many other businessmen. He doesn't really weigh the risks or the returns if he feels something is worth doing. He will just put in the time and do his best.\"It explains why he helps coffeeshop operators scout for locations for new outlets, and plan their coffee and drink stations, at no extra charge.The father of three sons and one daughter, aged between three and 16, is proud that Kim Guan Guan has carved out a 15 per cent share of the market as a local coffee supplier.\"It would be nice to have my own coffee place but until I can find the right people to manage it, I won't do so,\" says the entrepreneur, who now has 30 employees.He says he has learnt to treat every problem as an opportunity to learn. \"I don't go, 'Why me?' Because if you have that attitude, you will become sour. And the more sour you become, the worse the problem gets.\"As for the girlfriend who dumped him, predicting that he would not amount to much, he says their paths crossed once after he had turned his fortunes around.\"She hinted she wanted to get back together. But a mirror, once cracked, will never be the same again,\" he says.kimhoh@sph.com.sgThis story was first published in The Straits Times on March 24, 2013To subscribe to The Straits Times, please go to http://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

That single owner, leading kidney specialist Gordon Ku, said he had been collecting wines for more than 40 years.In an interview with Christie's on its website, Mr Ku said that he was introduced to wine in his late teens \"when (his) elder brother, who was studying in Britain, introduced wine to the family\".He describes the collection he sold as his \"apothecary collection\".\"The fact that I am a doctor is coincidental, but wine does have some medicinal value, as known from even mediaeval days.\"Dr Ku runs the Ku Kidney & Medical Centre and is also chairman of local medical technology firm Awak Technologies, which is developing a wearable artificial kidney.He is married, with two children. Originally from Hong Kong, he moved to Singapore in 1973.Out of 726 lots auctioned, 695 were sold and about 15,000 bottles remain in his collection, most of which he keeps in three cellars at home.More wine is kept in commercial cellars in Singapore, Britain and Beaune, France.Dr Ku's strategy to buying wines is to buy more good vintage wines and fewer off-vintage ones, which are also good \"because the wine is earlier-drinking and the price is more reasonable\".The top 10 lots of Dr Ku's collection were sold within and above their estimated ranges.These include one lot of 10 bottles of acclaimed French vintner Henri Jayer's Vosne-Romanee Premier Cru 2001 Cros-Parantoux, which went at HK$427,000, much higher than the estimated range of HK$260,000 to HK$380,000.Head of wine of Christie's China, Mr Simon Tam, who conducted part of the auction, said that \"many of the maturing wines on offer in this sale are approaching their delicious drinking windows\" and deemed it \"a collection for enjoyment\".This is the second time that Christie's Hong Kong has held a single-owner wine auction for an Asian consignor, said Mr Tam.He added: \"Single-owner collections are uncommon to come by in the wine auction market... as most collectors prefer to keep their profiles private.\"Proceeds from the auction lot of Jeroboam of Chateau Latour Vintage 1961, which went under the hammer for HK$146,400, will be donated to the Kidney Dialysis Foundation, which Dr Ku founded in 1996.There were buyers from 14 countries across Asia, the Americas and Europe.Mr Tam said: \"The number of wine bidders from China in Christie's Hong Kong from 2008 to 2012 grew by 1,550 per cent.\"Chinese wine collectors are sophisticated and discriminating when it comes to building their collections.\"RACHAEL BOONJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

The coroner ruled that Ms Claire Squires, 30, had \"taken a supplement containing DMAA which... in combination with extreme physical exertion, caused acute cardiac failure\".DMAA causes arteries to constrict (narrow), thus raising blood pressure which can lead to arrhythmias (irregular heart beats), heart attacks, bleeding in the brain, seizures, hallucinations, paranoia and bizarre behaviour. Anyone taking the chemical, young or old, fit or not, is as liable to suffer these effects.In August last year, about four months after Ms Squires' death, the British regulator decided to classify DMAA as an unlicensed medicinal product.Late last month, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seized 1,500 cases of supplements with DMAA from a certain supplement chain. This was after the regulator had, in April last year, requested 11 major supplement companies to voluntarily withdraw all pills with DMAA.The FDA had, in recent years, received 86 reports of adverse effects including deaths, heart problems and neuropsychiatric issues with supplements containing DMAA, first marketed in 1971 as a nasal decongestant called Forthane.Because it caused blood vessels to constrict, vessels found in the nose lining had less blood flowing through them and thus less nasal discharge resulted. It did work, but Forthane was withdrawn in 1983 after adverse effects were reported.These side effects - raised blood pressure, headaches and tremors - mimicked those of amphetamines. DMAA molecules resemble amphetamines so much that they interfere with the measurement of blood amphetamine levels.DMAA, like amphetamines, also stimulates the brain. In fact, some pills containing DMAA are even marketed as Herbal Ecstasy for legal \"highs\". This is because the party drug called Ecstasy is methamphetamine, the parent drug to amphetamine. The human body metabolises Ecstasy into and excretes it as amphetamine.Amphetamines stimulate the brain to cause euphoria and an energy surge; they are addictive too.One non-profit group lists 79 different products that contain DMAA sold by about as many companies in stores and online.Supplement makers are required by US law to notify the FDA whenever they add a new man-made ingredient. But no firm had submitted such evidence before marketing supplements with DMAA, as it was supposedly a \"natural\" extract. US law requires the FDA, not the maker, to bear the sole burden of showing a natural extract to be harmful.Of 11 major supplement firms asked by the FDA to voluntarily withdraw all pills with DMAA in April last year, only one had not complied a year later. That company submitted to the FDA three China-based studies it funded to prove that DMAA was a natural constituent found in geranium, a flower allegedly used for centuries in traditional medicine.However, the FDA found all three studies to be methodologically flawed. And the same three China-based research groups funded by the company to produce the studies showing DMAA in geranium were themselves unable to replicate these results in subsequent studies they carried out unfunded by the firm.US-based research groups have not found DMAA in geranium. Thus, DMAA is not found naturally. In fact, it is a synthetic amphetamine-like molecule. Since amphetamines are not sold over the counter, DMAA shouldn't be either.In Singapore, \"DMAA is classified as a medicinal ingredient: supplements are not allowed to contain any Western active ingredients\", according to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), which says it \"has not approved any medicinal product containing DMAA\".The HSA lists DMAA as \"not suitable for use in health supplements\" but it doesn't screen or check supplements before they are allowed on the market because they \"generally contain ingredients that are low risk and are used for maintaining or enhancing health\". That no pre-market approval is necessary \"is an approach used by FDA too\", it said.That is, there are no pre-market approval, licensing and registration for supplements sold here. Instead, dealers are responsible for the products' quality and safety.When adverse effects happen and are reported to its Vigilance Branch by doctors who see affected consumers as patients, HSA then steps in to investigate.Thus, in the infamous Slim 10 saga in 2002, local actress Andrea De Cruz suffered liver failure after consuming a Chinese diet pill called Slim 10. The pills were freely sold until this adverse effect was reported by attending doctors, and HSA stepped in and tested 45 slimming products.Consumers can contact the HSA's enforcement branch to report any supplement with illegal ingredients like DMAA being sold here. Also, HSA has an ongoing post-market sampling of health products to stem out illegal ones.Responding to The Straits Times' queries, HSA said it has rejected commercial imports of DMAA-containing products and has not to date received any adverse reports linked to its use here. It has now \"initiated surveillance checks on the presence of DMAA products on the market\". Such sales risk \"a fine of up to $5,000 and/or imprisonment\".A concerned runner or family member can go the extra step to be vigilant: scrutinise the label to avoid DMAA anyway. But dealers have used other names for it, like Pelargonium graveolens extract; Geranium extract; Geranamine; Dimethylamylamine; 1,3-Dimethylamylamine; 1,3-Dimethylpentylamine; Methylhexanamine; 2-Amino-4-methylhexane; 2-Hexanamine; Methylhexanenamine; 4-Methyl-2-hexanamine; or 4-Methyl-2-hexylamine.So, consumers beware.andyho@sph.com.sgThis story was first published in The Straits Times on July 11, 2013To subscribe to The Straits Times, please go to http://www.sphsubscription.com.sg/eshop/Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

We reproduce below extracts from two articles where he shares his perspective on Islamic banking. Dispelling myths about syariah-compliant financial products Retail investors will soon get to invest in Singapore's first syariah-compliant real estate investment trust (Reit). In fact, the Sabana Reit - set to hold about $850 million of Singapore industrial properties - is expected to be the world's largest certified syariah-compliant Reit when it goes on sale late this year.That is exciting news, but let's back up a moment.Even many savvy investors are hazy when it comes to the apparently mysterious world of Islamic finance. How does a syariah-compliant financial product differ from a conventional one?To add to the confusion, there are unfamiliar Islamic finance-related terms such as riba, haraam, sukuk and murabahah to contend with. The Sunday Times reports:Myth: Islamic banking is an outdated banking system which is not suitable for modern society.This is untrue. According to Mr Ismail, head, Islamic banking at Maybank Singapore, Islamic banking has matured from a niche market into a global financial industry.\"The demand for financial products and services that conform to syariah is increasing as it provides transparency and certainty,\" he said.It was recently reported that the global Islamic finance industry's assets are in excess of US$1 trillion today.This may double in the next three to five years.More businesses are keen to be certified syariah-compliant and it is a commercial decision.By doing so, they open themselves to a wider investor base that includes Middle Eastern customers with deep pockets and investors keen to uphold syariah principles and ethical investing values. It helps that there are often no significant changes to their operations even after they become syariah-compliant, said Islamic finance experts.New Islamic financing package from MaybankMaybank Singapore is offering smaller firms an Islamic commercial property loan that comes with one of the longest fixed interest rate terms here.The product, called Maybank Islamic Term Financing, will provide small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) with financing for completed commercial and industrial properties, on a mid- to long-term basis.Maybank said in a statement yesterday that both fixed- and floating-rate packages can be offered in terms of up to 10 years - much longer than the two to three years that are generally offered by lenders here.It also said SMEs that take up its floating rate packages can enjoy more peace of mind because the floating rate comes with a 5 per cent cap on effective rates per year.The announcement comes after the success of a similar syariah-compliant commercial property financing product, launched in Malaysia last June.Maybank Singapore head of Islamic banking Ismail Hussein said the product had contributed significantly to Maybank's Islamic SME financing portfolio - worth more than RM597 million.\"What was interesting was that in Malaysia, 40 per cent of our Islamic financing base is made up of non-Muslim businesses,\" he said.\"Similarly, I think the take-up of Islamic financing will be good here across both Muslim and non-Muslim SMEs because of the certainty and peace of mind it provides, especially given the current uncertain global economic environment.\"Mr Ismail said the product is based on principles of Islamic financing, where rates to be paid by customers are agreed upon upfront.\"Customers get the peace of mind, knowing exactly how much they have to pay for the financing.\"Islamic banking, which adheres to syariah or Islamic law, forbids the payment of interest, speculation or investment in businesses such as gambling and alcohol.The conservative nature of the system makes Islamic banking a less volatile alternative to conventional banking. For example, the ban on interest earnings and the lack of Islamic structured products shielded the sector from toxic assets like the sub-prime loans that hurt mainstream banks in the recent financial crisis.A check with SME lenders like Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank and OCBC Bank confirmed that off-the-shelf financing packages with fixed rates that stretch up to 10 years are rare.While they say loan packages can still be customised with longer fixed terms based on the needs of a customer, such requests were far and few between, especially in a low interest rate environment.Most businesses saw Maybank's new product as a positive move to support growth, but some, like Tridan International founder Daniel Yap, prefers having the flexibility to refinance his loans.\"Ten years is really a long time, especially for a commercial property loan. Typically, I would consider refinancing it in about two or three years,\" he said.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Shanmugam unveiled the latest development by Frasers Centrpoint Limited at the Northpoint City exhibition in Northpoint Shopping Centre this afternoon.With a full integration of public shopping malls and private residential estates, the Yishun community is set to transform into a vibrant hub for its residents.Although it is not slated to be completed until 2018, here are three things to know about the upcoming Northpoint City and what exciting things we can expect.1. It will feature Singapore's first Community Club in a shopping mallNorthpoint City will feature Singapore's first Community Club located in a shopping mall, Nee Soon Central Community Club. It is also the first Community Club to be fully air-conditioned, moving from a \"void deck CC\" to a \"lifestyle CC\", a name penned by the People's Association (PA).The idea was first suggested by Nee Soon Central MP Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim. The Community Club will offer programmes that the PA says will \"promote community and intergenerational bonding\".Residents, especially the elderly, will be able to relax in an air-conditioned environment. PA's chief executive director Ang Hak Seng had also promised that there will be no additional costs to the residents for activity fees held in the Community Club.2. It will fully integrate public and private spacesResidents will soon be able to shop right at their doorsteps with the integration of commercial and residential spaces in Northpoint City.The whole development will run like a dynamic self-sufficient town. Northpoint Shopping Centre, the largest mall in the North of Singapore, as well as the new shopping centre to be built across the street from it, will provide an array of shopping, dining, leisure and entertainment facilities.A residential development will also be integrated into the commercial and retail spaces of the shopping malls, allowing residents greater convenience and transforming the area into an exciting place to live in.3. It will feature a shopping underpass leading to the MRT stationThere will be a shopping underpass that leads from Northpoint City to Yishun MRT station, the town garden and surrounding amenities, so residents can now make their walk to the station a more exciting and vibrant one.Additionally, with an air-conditioned bus interchange in Northpoint city, residents can comfortably wait for their buses without going out into the heat.These latest developments will help to create seamless connectivity and greater accessibility for residents living in the area.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Barely six months after their first meeting, the sisters brought up the idea of a shared space.The result? An airy and inviting space in Crawford Lane - half bakery and half textile print studio - which opened in May.Such collaborative retail spaces look set to grow in number as smaller retailers join forces in response to sky-high rents.For the trio behind Maketh Project, rent was a major concern in their search for a suitable space last year. After two years of making leather goods from home, they wanted a studio to spread their knowledge of the craft.They now occupy the back room of long-time Bali Lane resident, Straits Records.\"It wasn't what we initially wanted,\" revealsMs Adlina Adil, 29, looking around the room tucked away behind stacks of vinyl records and CDs.They had envisioned a roomy workshop with high ceilings, \"but then we realised it was a good start\", she continues.The owner of Straits Records says he does not care about making a profit off them.\"I told them, you can look elsewhere, but you won't be paying the same rate,\" says Mr Ridhwan Abdul Ghany, 39.He declines to reveal how much he charges, though he says the two businesses share the rent according to how much space they each take up.Since Maketh Project opened their studio in January, response has been overwhelming. They conduct classes every day, charging from $37.90 a person for each workshop, allowing them to cover their rent.In Singapore, collaborative concept stores have been around for a few years. Two-year-old Pact at Orchard Central, which houses a restaurant, lifestyle store and hair salon, is still going strong.Shared pop-up spaces are also de rigueur, such as the recently concluded three-month urban farm project by consultancy Edible Gardens and retailers Naiise and Haystakt on the roof of People's Park Complex.But for some of these collaborative retailers, permanence is still what they strive for.\"The dream was to have a shop in Orchard Road,\" says Revasseur designer Gilda Su, 31.She and several partners founded the hip hybrid concept store Superspace in May at Orchard Gateway. It carries multiple fashion labels and houses a hair salon. They hope to inject vibrancy into the retail scene here, which they see as stale.Also hoping to reinvigorate the scene are former Ann Siang Hill darlings the little drom store and Kki, a patisserie-cum-retailer of designed objects. They have a new home at the School of the Arts.After they moved out of their cosy enclave last December due to the soaring rent, finding a proper space proved difficult. They even considered moving into an industrial park at one point.\"We were open to going our separate ways. We had those talks,\" says Ms Antoinette Wong, 29, of the little drom store.Slated to open next month, the two-in-one shop will stock more self-designed products and bakery Kki will introduce a line of home interior goods, Kki Home.Also opening next month is SPies & All Things Nice, a takeaway pie counter carved out within the premises of Harnn, a boutique in Tiong Bahru that sells Asian-inspired artisanal products.While the two businesses might seem like odd bedfellows, pie boss Stephen Koh assures you there is a link between the two.\"Like Harnn, the pies will have Asian influences - we have flavours such as ayam buah keluak and laksa,\" says the 44-year-old, who is Peranakan.Mr Koh, also the marketing manager of Harnn, has the support of his employer, who sees it as an extension of the food-and-beverage arm of the business. Harnn operates Tichaa Tea & Dining Room, a tearoom in Chiangmai, Thailand.Beyond sharing costs, these partners often find ways to synergise and even act as each other's sounding board for business decisions at times.\"We test the baked goods and give feedback. Sometimes we have to tell her, 'Can you price your stuff higher?'\" says Ms Aisah of Fictive Fingers with a laugh. \"It's like one big family,\" she adds of their relationship with And All Things Delicious.Like any family living under one roof, the owners say not everything is smooth-sailing all the time, but open communication is key.The partnership between Kki and the little drom store has lasted since 2010, proof that some shared spaces have staying power in an increasingly crowded market.On the secret to a successful tie-up, Ms Delphine Liau, 37, of Kki says: \"You have to talk more. It can't just be about money. You have to share certain dreams together.\"nabilahs@sph.com.sg"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Singaporeans were enamoured with it and trips there were a big deal.Mr Hsien, now 65 and a retired treasury officer for a finance company, recalls: \"Plaza Singapura was on the way to the photo studio in Middle Road. It had a nice outdoor space and we liked the scenery, so we thought it was a good place to take a picture.\"Over the years, especially after my children were born, we often shopped at Yaohan there while my daughter had art classes at Yamaha. My friends would also send their children there, so we would meet while they were at class.\"His two children are now in their 30s. He adds: \"I remember the long queues for the 10-cent Anpan buns and sushi at Yaohan. Plaza Singapura became the place to go to if we needed anything such as gifts and new clothes.\"The mall turns 40 this year and despite fierce competition from bigger and shinier shopping centres along Orchard Road, it continues to stand tall and appeal to shoppers of all ages.It has also outlasted a number of its peers in town, such as Specialists' Shopping Centre and Scotts Shopping Centre, which have since bitten the dust.Many shoppers like Mr Hsien fondly remember Plaza Singapura - it is affectionately called PS or Plaza Sing - for being one-of-a-kind when it opened in 1974. Then, it was one of the first shopping centres in Singapore and one of the largest at the time.At the time, other malls along Orchard Road included home-grown department store Tangs, which opened in 1958. Down the road, Specialists' Shopping Centre, built in 1972, was home to the John Little department store. It has since been demolished and Orchard Gateway, which opened earlier this year, now stands in its place.But unlike these malls, which had a single tenant or just a few tenants, Plaza Singapura changed the Orchard Road retail scene. Retail units and dining spots shared the 480,000 sq ft space and the mall pioneered the concept of anchor tenants.It brought in Yaohan, a Japanese retail company to set up its first outlet in Singapore - its premises comprised a department store and supermarket. Elsewhere in the mall, Ponderosa restaurant, Doremi cafe and Times the Bookshop were favourite haunts of shoppers.Ms Melissa Ang, general manager of Plaza Singapura, says: \"DBS Land, the developer then, was able to see the trend ahead, that this is going to be the shopping centre prototype - having an anchor tenant, with speciality shops and restaurants... everything was under one roof and of such a large scale. It was a pull and revolutionised the way people shopped.\"Another draw was the carpark that was linked to the mall at every floor - a novel concept at that time.Besides Yaohan, other brands also set up shop in Singapore for the first time.Optical retailer Paris Miki, one of the mall's oldest tenants, started out with a 1,000 sq ft store on the first floor. Singapore was the second location, after Paris, to have a store by the Japanese label.Mr Denule Nai, 44, sales manager of Paris Miki, says: \"We were next to Yaohan and we got the spillover crowd from there. Many Japanese tourists would also come to buy spectacles from us. Being here for so long, we have third- and fourth-generations of families coming to see us.\"The store has since moved to a 732 sq ft unit on the third floor and has one employee who has worked there since 1979.Plaza Singapura was also a go-to place for building and homeware items. But while many of these retailers such as lighting shop Million Electric have moved out, long-time tenant Equip-Design & Supply, which sells luxury locks on the fifth floor, has stayed put.Second-generation owner Alvin Loh remembers the \"kampung feel\" of the mall. The 43-year-old, who runs the shop with his younger brother, says: \"From the time I was eight, I would be in the store. All the retailers knew one another and I could just wander down the corridors, go into the next shop and the staff would give me a drink.\"Part of the mall's charm through the years is that it has always been family- oriented, says Ms Ang. \"We've established ourselves as that from Day One. It's not a luxury mall. But we've also brought in international labels which shoppers like, such as Uniqlo, and we're still a destination for necessities.\"In Singapore where malls continue to sprout both in the suburbs and the city centre every year, Plaza Singapura is doing well - it had 2.5 million visitors every month last year.Local research start-up Bimar, which tracks consumers' behaviour and footfall (the number of people entering a shop or shopping area at a given time) here, noted earlier this year that when compared with Ion Orchard, Takashimaya and Tangs, Plaza Singapura garnered 24 per cent of the visiting population among the four malls. It also estimated that the mall gets an hourly footfall of more than 20,000 people on a normal working day.Bimar's chief operating officer Chiara Bertoldini says: \"According to the results from our crowd remote monitoring system, Plaza Singapura - although older and away from the heart of Orchard Road - can easily compete with the popular neighbouring malls. The result is unsurprising, considering the mall's popularity among families, young adults and teenagers, and the fact it hosts a lot of international brands and famous dining places.\"The mall's strong following has much to do with its continual upgrading. Its first major makeover came in 1997 and cost $85 million. It shut for 14 months to overhaul its facade and relooked its tenant mix.While the mall looked new when it reopened, Ms Ang says the challenge was to bring back old customers who had gravitated towards other newer malls then. \"The mall was closed for a long time, so we had to win back shoppers.\"It was also a difficult time as Plaza Singapura's big draw, Yaohan, had pulled out in June 1997.But it bounced back with new anchor tenants such as Japanese retailer Daimaru, which opened in 1998, and a 700-seat foodcourt and local furnishing giant Courts. A further boost came from Golden Village Entertainment, which took up much of the seventh floor with 10 screens in 1999, making it the second largest cinema for the chain, after its VivoCity outlet.Echoing the sentiment among the other tenants, Golden Village's chief executive officer Clara Cheo says: \"Plaza Singapura might be at the end of Orchard Road but it has a massive interchange train station. And there are many tertiary institutions around here. Nothing beats its location in drawing the crowd.\"When the North East Line was built at the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, the mall had a small-scale renovation between 2002 and 2003 to improve connectivity between the mall and the station. New tenants were also brought in - almost half of the 230 stores were new.Big-name anchor tenants included French supermarket giant Carrefour, Japanese electronics store Best Denki as well as the Robinsons Group's John Little and Marks & Spencer stores.Almost a decade later, the mall underwent another facelift - this time for 21 months and at a cost of $150 million - and was extended to include space from its neighbour, The Atrium@Orchard. CapitaMall Trust, which owns Plaza Singapura, bought The Atrium@Orchard from the Government in 2008.Aside from a facade change, 80 new shops were added, including several first-in-Singapore concepts such as Tim Ho Wan, the one-Michelin-star dim sum restaurant from Hong Kong. When the restaurant opened in April last year, it caused a frenzy and brought back long queues the mall is familiar with.Mr Michael Chuang, general manager for business development and project management at PJ Partners, which runs Nana's Green Tea on the third floor of the new wing, says: \"As a cafe, we need a lot of foot traffic and high turnover of customers. Plaza Singapura is a reputable mall which can draw crowds, unlike our previous outlet in JCube, where we were not getting our target customers.\"But as the mall celebrates its milestone, associate professor of marketing education Seshan Ramaswami at Singapore Management University cautions that in a tough retail market, the mall cannot rely on its heritage alone.\"The challenge is to constantly reinvent itself, by staying relevant to its target market,\" he notes. \"Malls in the heartland, such as nex in Serangoon Central, can potentially take away weekend crowds of families. So Plaza Singapura needs to consistently create events and atrium attractions, and partner entertainment providers to give people a reason to make that trip from the suburbs.\"But for those who grew up with memories of the mall, Plaza Singapura will always hold a soft spot in their hearts.Property agent Shahlan Saim, 45, used to work at Yamaha in 1991, where he sold musical instruments for four years. The highlight of his time there was meeting stars and musicians, including American rapper M.C. Hammer, who made a stopover in Singapore on the way to Brunei. He even snagged a photo with the star.Mr Shahlan, who now visits the mall once a month, says: \"When I started working there, it wasn't as crowded as in its early days. There were newer, cooler malls which came up, such as Far East Plaza. But I loved Plaza Singapura then because it was just fun working there. Even now, it's still my favourite mall.\"natashaz@sph.com.sgWhat are your memories of Plaza Singapura? E-mail stlife@sph.com.sg"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

In all, governing Singapore chews up only about 17 per cent of its gross domestic product, less than the 25 per cent limit proposed by British economist John Maynard Keynes, they add, calling the Singapore model \"the Asian alternative\" to the largely bloated, bumbling and bribe-happy governments elsewhere.Crediting founding father Lee Kuan Yew as its creator, the authors laud his style as \"tough love\" which is \"elitist and stingy\", resulting in the greatest economic \"miracle\" of the past 70 years. That, the authors argue, had a lot to do with his insistence on self-reliance, in the form of the Central Provident Fund where 90 per cent of what you get depends on what you put in, instead of social assistance, which he considers an \"all-you-caneat\" buffet, as practised most notably in welfarist Scandinavia.Most significantly, they stress, China is learning all it can about Singapore-style governing. So, they note, while some may scoff at the city-state's ban on chewing gum and treating its citizens \"like children\", its mix of state-directed capitalism and city planning is being copied on a grand scale by China.Micklethwait is The Economist's editor-in-chief, while Wooldridge is currently its management editor, writing the superb column Schumpeter on workplace concerns. They interviewed Mr Lee for this book in 2011, and devote Chapter 6 of their nine-chapter book to the Republic.This book, their sixth outing together, focuses on what they call the coming \"fourth revolution\" in governance, claiming that this revolution, iconised by their Asian alternative, will be bigger than even communism.This fourth revolution is nigh, they argue, because most people have grown contemptuous of those who lead their countries. The authors say this is largely because the free-wheeling Western version of democracy has led to increasingly demanding electorates which massive, clunky government machinery fails to serve well.The first 31/2 revolutions in governance then, they argue, began in 1651 when Briton Thomas Hobbes published his tract Leviathan. In it, Hobbes proposed a social contract between rulers and the ruled, in which citizens would let rulers restrain some of their rights in return for protection. This gave sovereigns reason to build a bureaucracy to help them govern, transforming their fiefdoms into nation states.The nation state was the dominant form of political control until The Enlightenment of the 18th century and the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. Western thinkers in these two centuries unleashed the second revolution, arguing for greater personal liberty and smaller government. Chief among them were Briton John Stuart Mill, and his father James, who championed keeping the state out of most people's affairs as much as possible. Their views gained traction as they were buoyed by the growth of free trade and industry globally.The 20th century, however, brought a backlash against such free-spiritedness, the authors note, as most people came to believe that it led to lots of physical and social diseases. This led to the third revolution in governance, when husband and wife Sidney and Beatrice Webb gave the world their blueprint for the welfare state, in which governments intervened in almost every facet of a person's life, especially in education and health care. Big government did not get bigger than this, and the Webbs' welfare state was embraced most famously by the Nordic countries.The \"half revolution\" after this, say the authors, came in the person of American economist Milton Friedman. He militated against big government. Britain's Margaret Thatcher and United States president Ronald Reagan heeded him and forced their citizens to be more self-reliant, which was very disruptive as the latter had come to expect handouts from their governments.The authors dub Friedman's mantra a half revolution because Friedman himself acknowledges that he has only partially succeeded, as bloat and inefficiency in government are back, and in some cases bigger than before. As the authors note, Friedman himself said in 2004: \"After World War II, opinion was socialist, but the practice was free market. Now, opinion is free market, but practice is nearly socialist.\"Singapore, as created by Mr Lee, they say, \"is two parts Hobbes, one part Mill, with a dash of Asian values\". The latter are defined as rooted in focusing on family, saving one's income, learning for life and having faith in mandarins. The authors, however, stop short of calling Singapore's governing style \"ideal\". That is only to be expected, because their vision of the fourth revolution is of a governing model in which citizens are freer to express themselves and innovate.But here is where they seem to be running around in circles. Being freer, in the sense of unfettered individualism, is also a big part of what has led to present decay in most governments. As they themselves acknowledge in the book: \"Politicians have done what the voters want them to do.\"The authors try to argue their way out of those circles by saying that a ruling elite should think long term and use technology to tighten things at the national level, while letting the citizenry solve more of society's problems at the local level by innovating to, say, cut the cost of heart surgery from $100,000 to $2,000, as India's Devi Shetty has done.This book is also important for firmly laying to rest the myth that Scandinavia has made a success of the Webbs' welfare state. As the authors see it, the Scandinavians went through massive credit crunches well ahead of the United States and its sub-prime mortgages, and the rest of Europe and its euro crisis.For instance, the authors show, Sweden had to butcher its public spending programmes after its mortgage rate shot up to 500 per cent in the 1990s. \"The streets of Stockholm are awash with the blood of sacred cows,\" note the authors. That was after the Danes were faced with a daily diet of potatoes only in the early 1980s.The thing is, they stress repeatedly, the East is hungry for new ideas and willing to learn, whereas Western leaders are \"like ostriches\", burying their heads in the sand. As the authors point out: \"If you want to look at the future of higher education, can you learn more from the United States and France, where 40 per cent and 25 per cent of the students drop out, or from South Korea, which beats the world in college enrolment?\"If you want to set up a pension system, would you look at America's Social Security system or Singapore's Central Provident Fund?\"suk@sph.com.sgFACT FILE: Collaborators and colleagues with much in commonTHE Economist's editor-in-chief, John Micklethwait, and his colleague, Adrian Wooldridge, have to date written six books together on various subjects. Their tomes include the provocative God Is Back: How The Global Rise Of Faith Is Changing The World, and their newest - The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race To Reinvent The State.Both have much in common. They are British, they read history at Oxford University and they are both married fathers - Micklethwait has three sons, while Wooldridge has two daughters.Micklethwait, who celebrated his 52nd birthday on Monday joined The Economist in 1987 as finance correspondent, after two years as a banker at Chase Manhattan. Then followed stints as its business editor and United States editor, before becoming The Economist's 16th editor-in-chief in 2006, succeeding Bill Emmott, who left under a cloud after supporting the US' second incursion into Iraq in 2003.Voted the Editors' Editor in 2010 by his peers, Micklethwait has distinguished himself by growing the vaunted magazine's global print circulation by about 500,000 copies, compared to the 1 million when he took over the editorship in 2006.He has also successfully persuaded his colleagues to adapt their content for the Internet, smartphones and tablets; as at 2013, his magazine had more than 100,000 digital subscribers.As for Wooldridge, readers of The Economist, whose writers famously do not get bylines, will know him better as Schumpeter, the pin-sharp columnist on management issues.Before he became The Economist's management editor, he was its Washington Bureau chief, and so wrote the Lexington column on American current affairs."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Built at a cost of $3 million and completed in 1973, it received funding from the Singapore and Japanese governments. It was designed by Professor Kinsaku Nakane, a leading Japanese garden and landscape artist, and his three assistants from Tokyo.The Chinese Garden, which is connected to the Japanese Garden, was designed by prominent Taiwanese architect Yu Yuen-chen and opened in 1975.Once plans are finalised, the integrated space will have a park in the heartland, bigger than the 62ha Bishan- Ang Mo Kio Park, one of the largest urban parks in central Singapore. The new gardens will be completed by 2017, said National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan in his blog on Monday.The transformation is not confined to the gardens. Under the URA Masterplan, which includes the Jurong Gateway, the Jurong Lake District will have edutainment attractions and hotel clusters.The district, bounded by Boon Lay Way, Yuan Ching Road and Ayer Rajah Expressway, also looks set to become more vibrant as the 37-year-old Science Centre moves to a new site. The new building is slated to be completed in 2020.There are also plans for waterfront housing, hotels and more leisure options.A call for garden design ideas will go out next year and PM Lee encourages Singaporeans to send in the ideas they have for the area. Residents who spoke to The Straits Times earlier this week gave the plans a resounding thumbs-up.natashaz@sph.com.sgWhat would you like to see in the new Jurong neighbourhood? E-mail stlife@sph.com.sgRevamped gardens can be testbed for ideasThe Japanese and Chinese gardens have been around for more than three decades, without a major revamp to date. While their physical look is about to get a makeover, a change of perception of the area might be in order too.DP Architects director Seah Chee Huang says if people see the Jurong district as an industrial part of Singapore, the changes, especially with more developments around the lake, will make it less so.\"If there are hotels and more waterfront housing, that will inject a 'live-in' population to the area. This also has the potential to bring people straight to the heart of the action, which is the lake... This will add to the vibrancy of the area. People will know it's a good place to hang out.\"The gardens in the middle of Jurong Lake have long been dogged by comments that they are ghost towns most of the week. Even Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at Sunday's rally the Jurong Lake Gardens were \"under-utilised\" and looked dated, compared with the nearby Jurong Gateway area, which has educational institutions and new malls.But Associate Professor Tan Puay Yok from the department of architecture at the School of Design and Environment, National University of Singapore, says residents would not think the gardens are not well used. Instead, he feels these areas are \"under- visited\" - an impression that should change once the new amenities are built.He says: \"Residents get a lot of utility out of them. But those who travel to visit don't return because they think they've seen it all.\"But there are two factors the area has: serenity and natural landscape, much of which should be retained and its biodiversity highlighted. This will get more people in. Keep it natural, rather than a highly managed area, like with other parks.\"Indeed, the area has much biodiversity, especially bird life.The Nature Society (Singapore) has a list of important bird sites in the Jurong Lake area with many uncommon and rare birds. The list was last updated in 2010. The group has records of 123 species of birds in the lakeside area, along the shoreline and at the Chinese and Japanese gardens.For example, there is the rare Grey-headed Fish-eagle, spotted at the Chinese Garden, that is a resident breeder and is nationally threatened.The non-profit organisation first wrote to the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2008 to make recommendations on what can be done to the area. The suggestions included growing aquatic plants along the lake to \"create marshy habitats and to make the lake more scenic\".Dr Ho Hua Chew, vice-chairman of the society's conservation committee, says the members hope their recommendations will bear fruit now. \"We're glad the National Parks Board will be on the team to look at the area's redesign. We're happy to work with them to see how the wildlife here can be protected.\"Mr Franklin Po, chairman of landscape architectural firm Tierra Design, suggests the lake can be a good way to test new ideas for the future, especially when it requires \"water-sensitive urban design\" - a relatively new concept here. The lake could be a catchment area, and different ways to manage water can tried out.For example, harvested rainwater can be used for irrigation. Mr Po, who is an architect and landscape architect, adds: \"Grey water, which is from household water points such as sinks, can be recycled, while small riverines can have turbines within them to generate electricity.\"DP Architects' Mr Seah adds that the redevelopment of the area with the new Science Centre as the jewel is an \"exciting opportunity to take a more experimental approach\".He adds: \"There are plenty of possibilities out there. Key is that the proposals must be sustainable, attractive and inclusive. Remaking Jurong with purposeful planning can show others what a liveable city Singapore can be.\"Family staycations and funCompared with Orchard Road or Marina Bay, Jurong Lake District may not make a swanky address for hotels. Nonetheless, with its transformation plans, the Government hopes to turn it into a holiday getaway for residents and tourists.Hotel industry players and academics say there is potential for the area to have a different look from the Marina Bay area, which is about the same size as the Jurong Lake District.While the southern area of Marina Bay has been decorated with shiny skyscrapers and leisure offerings such as the massive integrated resorts and Gardens by the Bay, the Jurong Lake District can adopt a slower pace of life, says Dr Michael Chiam, senior lecturer in tourism at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.Think boutique or mid- sized hotels which cater mainly to families, he says. \"There's that possibility of off-city living, which will appeal to many families. Planners need to think about putting in good F&B and entertainment options which will cater to this group.\"One hotel is already on its way up in the area.Last year, Genting Singapore broke ground for a 550-room outfit, slated to open in the first half of next year.The company is behind Resorts World Sentosa and owns six hotel properties there - Crockfords Tower, Hotel Michael, Festive Hotel, Hard Rock Hotel Singapore, Equarius Hotel and the Beach Villas.The hotel in Jurong, which sits on a 9,027 sq m site along Jurong Town Hall Road, is the first hotel to launch in the Jurong Lake District.There are also plans to develop a business and medical hub nearby. The Ng Teng Fong Hospital, which will be completed next year, and Jurong Community Hospital will be there. It is also possible that the area would be home to Singapore's first high-speed rail station.Leveraging on the proximity to the lake, Mr Yap Beng Tiong, founder of Gravity+Form, a hotel design consultancy firm, says hotels can be built for medical tourists and businessmen who make work trips to the area.His home-grown company designed the Wyndham Grand Plaza Royale Hotel in Changsha and conceptualised the new Hotel Ruigao in Changde, a district city in the Hunan province, in China.But Mr Yap notes that the look of hotels in the Jurong Lake District should be different from their city counterparts.\"Travellers should be spared brand fatigue, which is a result of the unfortunate tendency of international brands to replicate,\" he explains. \"Also, there should be a different resort design from those in Sentosa. And these resorts shouldn't be connected to the lake superficially.\"The lake is a major plus point which should be used to full advantage, experts interviewed point out. Many suggest that the leisure developments explore setting up water-sports attractions such as wakeboarding, kayaking and paragliding, which will not only draw overseas visitors, but also residents, through the year.Atelier Dreiseitl Singapore's Leonard Ng, whose company was behind the well-received Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, says that currently, the lake is hard to access.In the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, the revamped river, which once had fences and traditional concrete canals, has an \"inclusive\" design. Now, park visitors can wade in the 3km-long river.Mr Ng, who is a landscape architect and managing director of the firm, says: \"Planners must think about how to get people to interact with the water. At this moment, there's very little that brings you close to it. There should be a more seamless transition to get to it.\"To bring the crowds, you can emulate what has been done in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. It's not just a park, but there are also restaurants, biodiversity and exercise stations.\"Ms Emma Tapang Meyer, course chair for the diploma in tourism and resort management at the Singapore Polytechnic Business School, believes the Jurong Lake District will draw the crowds when it is completed.\"By virtue of it being new, it will pique a lot of interest from locals. Marry that novelty with seamless accessibility and excellent customer service, and the place will market itself through word-of- mouth and generate fans and ambassadors,\" she says.Exciting exhibits still in store at Science CentreScience Centre Singapore chief executive Lim Tit Meng is used to unflattering comments about the 37-year-old building on Science Centre Road.Once, he recalls, a visitor, a chairman of a science centre in another country, told him she thought the building looked rundown and was poorly maintained.The 54-year-old, who is also an associate professor at the department of biological sciences at the National University of Singapore, says: \"Her reaction is typical. Many people don't bother to step in to see what we have. They see the same building through the years and assume that the inside will be worse.\"But that visitor did change her mind when she entered the building. \"She was impressed. It's a vibrant place with many things happening,\" says Prof Lim.The science centre will get new premises on the north shore of the Jurong Lake, near the Chinese Garden MRT station.The centre has had to overcome numerous hiccups over the decades. In 2010, it was announced that plans for a new centre had to be put on hold for four years due to budget constraints.Then there were the challenges with attracting visitors. Over the years, 29.5 million students have visited the centre, which was opened in 1977. Visitor numbers hit more than one million in 2009.After hitting a high that year, visitorship started to decline in 2012. Last year, it drew about 850,000 visitors.Prof Lim attributes the decline to the opening of new attractions. \"Legoland Malaysia opened and the Sentosa theme park, Universal Studios, and aquarium also came up,\" he says. \"Also, the Singapore dollar was strong, so parents took their children for holidays. Because of the economic uncertainty then, we couldn't do major revamps to the building.\"The new premises will serve as a chance to design a building that interacts with its surroundings. For example, Prof Lim says the lake and the surrounding gardens can be an exhibit on water quality, horticulture and biodiversity.He envisions a space in the new centre dedicated to science and technological inventions made in Singapore, such as the ThumbDrive by Singapore company Trek Technology and how treated waste water, or Newater, came about. \"We shouldn't shy away from our successes. The exhibits should be a statement for our people, for what Singapore can do.\"He also hopes that the new building will have malleable spaces. The current centre, which sits on a 6ha site and was designed by architect Raymond Woo, has no columns.While the current space is \"iconic\", Prof Lim says: \"The new building should be able to change like a transformer, or like how stages at pop concerts can be shifted around. This means the same area can be used for different purposes. A seminar area in the morning can turn into a performance space or a place for socialising in the evening.\"Despite the impending move, the centre's team remains committed to new programming at its current premises. New exhibitions, such as the ongoing Human Body Experience, where visitors can take a close look at the human anatomy, have been drawing crowds.A children's Science Centre was also set up this year. It now has 6,000 members, up from its initial 2,000 target. Both programmes are \"runaway successes\", says Prof Lim.Upcoming exhibits include a planetarium and a virtual aquarium. The line-up is part of a five-year plan for the centre.Prof Lim says: \"We're not going to stop focusing on the centre, since we have six to eight more years before we move. This place must still be relevant.\""}], "max_tokens": 10}}

And there has been a sharp rise in those heading overseas to study law. In Britain alone, the number of Singapore law students more than doubled from 510 to 1,142 between 2010 and last year.Law Minister K. Shanmugam dished out these numbers yesterday as he warned that Singapore could soon have more lawyers than jobs for them all.He urged law students to temper career and salary expectations, and maybe even consider other jobs.Speaking at the Criminal Justice Conference organised by the Singapore Management University (SMU) and National University of Singapore, which both have law schools, he said the number of lawyers is expected to grow by nearly a third in the next three years.But \"the market is not going to grow by 30 per cent\", he said, pointing out that this year, nearly 650 graduates will compete for about 490 practice training contracts at law firms, to get the training they need before being admitted to the Singapore Bar.\"About 150 students will have difficulty getting a training contract, let alone employment after that,\" said Mr Shanmugam, who is a senior counsel himself. \"The study of law provides an excellent training of the mind, so I don't want to be seen as discouraging people... but you have to have a realistic understanding of the market, the economy, the total structure.\"While Singapore is trying to \"grow the legal market\" through initiatives such as the Singapore International Commercial Court to handle dispute resolution, students could go into fields like banking, business, public service and even politics with their law degrees, he suggested.Rules governing training contracts could be changed to make it easier for more students to get them, \"but there is a limit to how much the Government can intervene in the market\", he said.He added that those who do get jobs should be realistic about their salaries: \"You see headlines that top lawyers make 'x' million dollars, but there is a huge difference between what the top two or three lawyers make, and what everyone else makes.\"Lawyers and academics whom The Sunday Times spoke to admitted that future lawyers should be prepared to face a lot of competition from their peers in the marketplace.SMU law lecturer Eugene Tan said \"the days of law firms chasing law graduates are now over\".\"Grades are helpful but students should also hone skills like writing and crafting legal arguments and research to improve their chances of being hired,\" he added.Veteran lawyer Chia Boon Teck said law graduates could consider joining multinational companies with large legal departments. \"If you want to join a law firm, study very very hard and aim to be among the top few graduates. Also, make as many friends who are lawyers as possible,\" he advised.Ms Lynn Kan, who is starting her second year at SMU's post-graduate law programme, said some of her classmates are already considering taking on more internships to improve their prospects.zengkun@sph.com.sgJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

He said: \"I am very happy. My office is just opposite and it has been inconvenient to find food stores that are open late.\"Ms Lynica Foo, in her 40s, vice-president of an investment holding company, used to frequent Lau Pa Sat about three times a week. She visited it twice yesterday - to buy fried bee hoon in the morning and thunder tea rice for lunch.But she was surprised to find that her food cost more. Fried bee hoon with two dishes now costs $3.80, up from slightly more than $2 in the past. Thunder tea rice now costs $5.50, up from $5. She said: \"I've been looking forward to the reopening, but a jump of about $1 or so is a bit much.\"One reason is the increase in stall rental fees from an average of $3,700 to $4,700 a month, stall owners said. Rising manpower and ingredient costs have also contributed.They are hopeful the increased seating capacity of the food centre will help bring more business. It can now seat 2,500 diners, 460 more than in the past.The ventilation has also been improved by installing eight industrial ceiling fans and reconfiguring the stalls' layout to allow air to flow better from one end of the food centre to the other.Madam Callie Lim, 40, who owns the Thunder Tea Rice stall, said: \"It does seem to be a bit cooler. Office workers tend to complain that it is too hot here, and take the food back to their offices to eat. With air flowing better, hopefully more people will come.\"The number of stalls has fallen from 90 to almost 60, but customers are not bothered. Ms Tan Seok Keng, 46, who works in the banking industry, said: \"In the past, many stalls sold similar things.\"While business was brisk at the older stores at Lau Pa Sat, it was quieter at some of the new stalls.Mr Kevin Tan, 55, who owns a new pizza stall, said: \"Most people seemed to be looking for the stalls they were familiar with, but we expect that business will pick up soon.\"cherylw@sph.com.sgJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

These funds are then deposited with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which converts them into foreign assets through the foreign exchange market. And as a majority of these assets are long-term in nature, these are then transferred over to the GIC to be managed.\"What these investment arrangements mean is that CPF members bear no investment risk at all in their CPF balances. Their monies are safe, and the returns they have been promised are guaranteed,\" said Mr Tharman.But he noted that while the Government expects GIC to earn returns higher than what it pays on the special government bonds over the long term, there is also no guarantee that GIC's returns will exceed the special government bonds' interest rates over shorter periods, let alone each year.The GIC has earned a \"creditable\" return over the long term, but this \"masks wide fluctuations in returns from year to year\", he said.For the last 20 years the GIC has earned a 6.5 per cent return per year in US dollar terms. This translates to 5.2 per cent in Singapore dollar terms.But over the five years following the 2008 global financial crisis, GIC earned just a 2.5 per cent return per year in US dollar terms, which translates to 0.6 per cent in Singapore dollar terms.In such years, when the financial markets are weak and when the GIC's returns fall below what the Government pays on its special bonds, the Government's net assets is what allows it to meet its interest obligations to the CPF Board.These net assets, which are assets in excess of liabilities, are what has helped absorb losses and ensure the Government can continue to pay the interest on the SSGS, he said. It is also because of this that no commercial players are able to take on the CPF obligations.\"The guarantor is not merely playing the role of a long-term investor. It also must have significant capital that provides a buffer when the markets are down,\" he said.Join ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

The completion of the 99-year leasehold condominium with 1,715 units on a sprawling 840,049 sq ft site will have a major impact on the existing developments in the Farrer Road-Leedon Road neighbourhood. A total of 255 units at d\u2019Leedon, developed by a CapitaLand-led consortium that includes Hotel Properties Ltd, remained unsold as at end-August, according to URA data. Five units were sold in August at a median price of $1,827 psf. The latest caveat lodged for a unit at d\u2019Leedon was for a 1,496 sq ft, three-bedroom apartment on the 30th floor that was sold for $2.62 million, or $1,749 psf, on Sept 2. Next door to d\u2019Leedon is GuocoLand\u2019sLeedon Residence, where construction is still underway. A redevelopment of the former Leedon Heights, the 381-unit freehold Leedon Residence was designed by Chan Soo Khian of SCDA Architects. In August, six units were sold at a median price of $1,837 psf. According to URA data, 143 units have been sold to date. A 2,131 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the sixth floor of Leedon Residence was sold for $5.4 million, or $2,534 psf The latest caveat lodged at Leedon Residence was for a 2,131 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the sixth floor of one of the blocks that was sold for $5.4 million ($2,534 psf). Three other low-floor units of identical sizes were sold in August at prices ranging from $1,942 to $2,097 psf, according to caveats lodged with URA Realis. The project is expected to be completed in 2015. Samuel Eyo, director of Savills Prestige Homes, reckons the completion of d\u2019Leedon will revive interest in Leedon Residence. However, given the size of d\u2019Leedon, it will keep the resale prices of older condo developments in the area such asTulip Garden,Sommerville Park,Sommerville Grandeur,Gallop GablesandSpanish Villagerelatively competitive.

While the freehold Sommerville Park was completed in 1985, Sommerville Grandeur was completed in 1996. The most recent transaction at the latter project was for a unit sold at $2.76 million ($1,500 psf) last month. At Spanish Village, the most recent transaction was for a unit that changed hands for $1.95 million ($1,216 psf) in September. Savills\u2019 Eyo predicts that there will be a flight to the newest condo with the latest facilities in the neighbourhood, hence d\u2019Leedon will see interest from potential tenants. Having the new Farrer Road MRT station at its doorstep is also a bonus. While Leedon Residence is freehold, unlike d\u2019Leedon, he reckons the two projects will fetch a similar rental rate of around $4.50 psf, as they are both relatively close to the MRT station. Further down Leedon Road, and located closer to the Holland Village MRT station isLeedon 2, a 72-unit freehold private condo that was completed 17 years ago. An 840 sq ft unit changed hands for $1.2 million ($1,429 psf) on Sept 12. The seller had purchased the unit in October 1996 for about $1.05 million ($1,247 psf), hence seeing a capital appreciation of 14% in 18 years. Eyo says owners of older condos in the Leedon and Farrer Road area will have to adjust the asking prices and rents of their units in view of the upcoming completion of d\u2019Leedon.

But low prices hid a deeper secret the firm was going bust, and now its customers, many of whom prepaid for furniture, are left without a sofa to sit on.Facebook anti-fansOn facebook an anti-fan site called Singapore Consumers vs Barang Barang (and parent co KLW Holdings) had this to say, Before folding they lured many new customers with clearance sales, taking the cash and promising delivery at a later date. Chances are, Barang Barang already knew they were insolvent, and used the sales to raise cash for their parent company to repay debt. Creditors are now lining up to file their claims against Barang Barang. If youve bought something from Barang Barang, we need consumers to band together, file a joint complaint with CASE, and make some noise - or never see the cash let alone furniture that we paid for.But facebook complaint sites may not be the only difficulties facing the company that owns Barang Barang.Parent company of Barang Barang, KLW Holdings, is run by executive chairman Lee Boon Teck. It should be noted that the MD, who just resigned, is the brother in law of the executive chairman Lee Boon Teck and the son in law of Mr Lee Choon Tai, a substantial shareholder of KLW.In an explanation to investors, managing Director Lims brother-in-law, executive chairman Lee Boon Tuck, said the board of directors and management wish to thank Mr Lim Kok Hui for his invaluable past contributions to the company.So what next for KLW?KLW reported it lost $5.7 million in 2009, and this on top of a $3 million loss in 2008. The group only had less than a million cash in the bank at December 2009 and had a loan or loans worth $14 million due sometime 2010.One of the bank loans of $4.4 million was guaranteed by the company and also certain directors of the subsidiaries.Of course these figures, which were contained in public records released March 1, state that they have not been audited or reviewed by the companys auditors, and there appears to be no updates since. And as for who will now be an independent director of KLW now that Mr Lim stepped down? None other than the Audit Committee Chairman, Mr Ho Pong Chong."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

With the implementation of the lemon law, consumers are protected against \"lemons\" or defective products where the retailers will have to replace, exchange or give refunds to consumers should there be any defective items.The question is, are business in Singapore prepared for the Lemon Law? If so, how can they prepared for it since the law will kick start in less than half a year's time? Look at Profit MarginsBusiness with low profit margin may be affected largely from the lemon law. Companies which have been slashing prices and giving away bulk discounts on their products and services in order to attract customers and challenge their competitors, should 'revisit' their pricing policy.One factor businesses have to factor into their prices, is whether the profit margin be able to cover the after sales costs such as maintenance costs, replacement of brand new products and the time taken to rectify the issue should the products deemed to be defective.If the products by nature does not have a wide profit margin for the business owner to play, he or she may need to diversify by getting a new product line with a bigger profit margin potential so as to 'balance' the company overall profits.This diversification of product lines might help to 'save' the business owner. Should one of the products line has too many defective cases, the business owner can have the liberty to 'abandon' the particular product without affecting the running of the business. Quality over Quantity Business owners should be more focused on providing products and services of good quality for their consumers instead; manufacturers should be more stringent in their quality control during production. Rather than mass production of quantities to meet consumer demand, the lemon law will encourage more business owners to bring in more quality products to the consumer market.By providing more products and services of good quality, the probability of having a 'lemon' will be much lower than a product which is massively produced without any stringent quality control. As a result, consumers, whether they are local or tourists, will be more confident of made in Singapore products or any products that are imported into and sell in Singapore; and hence, our economy will grow exponentially as a result. Strong Branding PresenceHaving a strong branding presence gives you a better market positioning than your competitors; on top of that, consumers feel more confident buying your company products and services. Lemon law, indirectly has prompted business owners and marketing managers to take charge of the business, plan and take actions on transforming the business into a brand.Small business owners must not think that the purpose of their business is just to make profits to pay the rent and such; they should look way beyond that. Small business owners should start doing things to make their businesses a brand from where they are now. You can start by building it around your niche. Having a good brand, gives you good corporate image and of course confidence in your consumers. Train Your Support TeamTrain your support team well. Business owners should set up a customer support services department or maintenance team to standby any rectification of products should a 'lemon' occurs. This group of employees should be well trained on the Lemon Law, practises great customer stewardship as well as able to manage customers' complaints effectively and cordially.By training your customer support services department well in advance from the implementation of the Lemon Law, your business will therefore be well prepared and can carry on smoothly without hiccups even when there's an occurence of 'lemons' along the way. Stengthening Customer RelationshipBusiness owners should bear this in mind, that \"an unhappy customer experience is worse than a lemon.\" Build up the Business to Customers relationship deeper. Tap on the pool of your existing clients if your business is already in the market for a certain period of years. Show them your appreciation by sending them a Thank You note.As for most retailers, be polite to your walk in propspects and give them the best customer shopping experience, it doesn't matter whether they buy or don't buy your products in the end. What most matters, is whether your business has leave behind a feeling of positiveness to your customers, so that people will feel great about your brand. Even when lemon law takes place, by having a very large proportion of prospects and customers who feels good about your business and your customer service, the chances of them complaining about your brand should a \"lemon\" occurs is very much minimal. Do Your Paperwork ProperlyPrepare in advance all your company's paperwork and documents especially those related to your customers such as the buying contract, the receipt and order form. This is to protect your company's from any unneccessary lemon issues that is not genuine and yet having a negative cricticism on your business and your branding.Some examples of that maybe your competitors who poses to be your difficult customers, or the minority of people who 'abuses' the lemon law. Although such cases of not genuine lemon cases are little to none, but it is important for your company to prepare for it; so that you will not waste time and money pacifiying non-genuine customers, and at the same time, focus your time on resolving genuine lemons should they occured. In a nutshell, business owners in Singapore should welcomed the lemon law in September and be ready for it. For it will boost their business and branding greatly if they are well prepared for it; moreover, it will make Singapore a great safe haven for shopping and wonderful customer experience.

Their lives are coming to an end. Yet, there is still one story to tell, the story of a friendship.It is about four men who cannot be more unemotional.Helmut Schmidt, Lee Kuan Yew, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz: cool, if not cold, power-hungry politicians.Yet, for more than 40 years, their friendship has been close, almost intimate. Now they are slowly saying their farewells to each other.Schmidt wanted to meet Lee, the founding prime minister of the Asian metropolis, for the last time.He has not looked forward to a trip for a long time as much as this one to see 'Harry', how Lee has been called among his friends since he was a student at Cambridge in England. From Singapore, Schmidt will be travelling to China for five days, also a long-cherished wish.Schmidt is 93. Who would still go on a 15-hour trip from chilly Hamburg to hot and humid Singapore at that age? In March, his doctors gave the green light: The thrombosis he is suffering from does not prevent him from flying.Lee, 89 years old, wrote to him to say how happy he was about the visit. Also, that his friend would need some rest after arrival, at least one night, to overcome the jet lag. The next evening, he would invite him to dinner.Afterwards, they want to sit down together on three afternoons, to talk with each other. About China, America, Europe - the big picture, the way they always used to do.A book shall be produced, a collection of their conversations on the world's situation. Neither would accept anything less.And then the conversation begins very softly. 'My wife passed away and left me at the age of 91,' says Schmidt. 'Loki died at 91?' - 'Yes, it was a big loss. Must be the same for you.' - 'Yes, it creates a deep hole in our life; nothing can fill it.'Three weeks before Loki Schmidt's death, at the beginning of October 2010, Lee's wife Choo died.As students at Cambridge, the two Lees stood out intellectually. Driven by ambition, they returned to Singapore. Lee established an educational dictatorship there which, despite all its successes, was feared.Lee could be merciless. He persecuted political opponents, sent them to their financial ruin with lawsuits, gagged the press.But when his seriously ill wife had been bound to bed unable to talk or move for more than two years, he came to sit next to her and read to her every night. He wanted her to die in peace. They were married for 64 years.'We were married for 68,' says Schmidt. 'We had hoped to stay together for 70 years,' he says. 'Yeah,' sighs Lee with a hoarse voice. 'Yeah.'Schmidt is sitting in a wheelchair on Lee's right; he can hear only with his left ear. Lee is sitting upright. He is wearing a dark blue Chinese silk jacket, and with his almost bald head, he appears like an aloof Beijing mandarin.Lee formulates articulately, in Oxford English full of nuances. In front of him stands a glass of hot water, but he does not take even one sip during the conversation.Schmidt is not allowed to smoke for hours, a torture to him. Lee, in the past a heavy smoker himself, is now allergic to cigarette smoke.Once, absorbed in thought, Schmidt reaches into the left pocket of his jacket, pulls out a box of cigarettes, lights a Reyno. Lee is going stiff, not saying anything, just looking at Schmidt, who is suddenly startled: Where is the ashtray? There is none.He hesitates and flings the cigarette with verve into a deep coffee cup. Great hilarity!'For me, this is a sentimental journey,' Schmidt says, picking up the thread again. He had been in Singapore for the first time in 1958 or 1959, had stayed at the famous Raffles Hotel back then. 'The old colonial officers pretended to drink tea but drank whisky instead!'Schmidt abruptly switches to politics, wants to know when Lee met Deng Xiaoping for the first time. It was in 1978, Lee replies, two years after the death of Mao Zedong, when Vice-Premier Deng began the economic transformation of the giant country.Lee believes that Singapore was Deng's example. A free market and a strong government - that's what he learnt from Singapore.It was also in 1978 that Schmidt and Lee met for the first time. Lee does not recall their first meeting. Schmidt's recollection of that day is more vivid. He had come from Japan and had stopped in Singapore on the way back, Schmidt says. Lee showed Loki the Botanic Gardens, and she was very impressed.Mr Olaf Ihlau, correspondent of Suddeutsche Zeitung at the time, wrote about Lee's and Schmidt's first meeting: 'Both politicians are very alike. They are men of action and pragmatists, experts on economic matters and are against ideological reveries.'Both are of great intelligence prone to impatience, and find it difficult to control their sense of superiority. The head of the South-east Asian island of prosperity has stopped appearing at press conferences a long time ago, where he had to answer possibly annoying questions.'Lee considers journalists to be 'crackpots'. Another stance that is probably not that far removed from Helmut Schmidt's.'Back in those years, nobody, not even the crackpots, could deny that Singapore was blossoming. After separating from Malaysia, Lee was pushing the former outpost of the British Empire with an iron hand into modern times.George Shultz also became interested in the South-east Asian economic miracle. On his way to an Asian summit meeting, America's then Treasury Secretary stopped in Singapore in 1972.Forty years later, Shultz talks about this visit while we are sitting at the Adlon Hotel in Berlin.It is May 24, and later that evening, he will receive the Henry Kissinger Award of the American Academy. Kissinger is also in town. And so is Schmidt, who will deliver the laudatory speech for Shultz.One is missing. Lee was not able to join them last autumn, when Schmidt, Shultz and Kissinger met in New York.Shultz remembers how both Lees proudly showed him their city, and how he told Kissinger about it after his return. 'It is very rewarding to talk to Lee, I said to Henry, who already knew him. We understand each other.'Shultz is the great organiser; he was the one who brought all four together for the first time. That was in 1982.Schmidt was still Federal Chancellor of Germany, and Shultz was just named Secretary of State by Ronald Reagan.Shultz brought Schmidt along as his guest to 'Bohemian Grove', a kind of summer camp for America's economic and political elite in California, with lots of drinking, bawdy jokes, and little talk about politics and business.Kissinger invited Lee, Shultz says. After the camp, they drove to Shultz's house on the campus of Stanford University for lunch. 'All four of us sat around my kitchen table and talked for two, three hours, until my wife and Choo (Mrs Lee) asked us to get up so they could prepare lunch. I was thinking to myself: What a great lesson for a new secretary of state!'Lee remembers how Schmidt sat down at the piano and 'professionally played classical pieces without any sheet music'. The four were smitten with each other. This was the beginning of a friendship that still lasts today.At that point, Schmidt and Shultz had already known each other for 10 years. They met at the 'Library Group' in 1972. In the wake of the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he wanted to meet the most important finance ministers in Washington, Shultz recalls.'Of course, Helmut was one of them.' He invited Schmidt, France's Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Britain's Tony Barber, and, later, Japan's Takeo Fukuda to a discussion over lunch.'I told the President about this. Nixon said: Good idea! Why don't you add some style to the meeting and hold it at the White House? So we went to the library of the White House - a wonderful room. Great food! And it worked.'We met again, we could talk on the phone, and it all led to mutual trust. Somebody then suggested to call our circle the 'Library Group'.'And it would become even more. During the meetings at the library of the White House, the idea of the Group of Seven summits was born.Of course, Kissinger and Shultz had known of each other before. Both had a career at university. Kissinger at Harvard, and Shultz just a couple of kilometres away at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). One is a historian and political scientist; the other an economist. 'I didn't know him personally,' Shultz says, 'but I knew of him.' 'Because what he said had a high public profile.'Richard Nixon brought the two of them together. Kissinger became National Security Adviser to the President, and later Secretary of State. Shultz was Secretary of Labour, then Treasury Secretary.Have they ever been rivals?'No,' Shultz says. They complemented each other. He, for instance, provided a study about the American dependence on oil imports, Shultz adds, while Kissinger was thinking about the strategic implications.Even after their time under Nixon, they remained in touch. When Shultz himself became Secretary of State, he sought the advice of his friend and predecessor.In old age, both Republicans have lent their authority to an astounding nuclear disarmament initiative: 'Global Zero' - total nuclear disarmament!However, Schmidt does see some differences between the two. 'Shultz is convinced about the need for nuclear disarmament; Henry is more reserved.' With regard to nuclear matters, Kissinger is 'the most rational and realistic'. 'He exaggerates realism a bit, as I see it.' And Schmidt's own view? 'Almost entirely on Shultz's side.'Why is there this surprising change of mind on nuclear policy matters by the former nuclear strategists? 'It was not a sudden change,' Schmidt explains. 'It was a slow development. I have always considered nuclear rearmament to be exaggerated.'And nevertheless: The change of mind cannot be denied. And there are good reasons for this.The former Cold Warriors had realised that a 'balance of terror' will only succeed between the high performance military of developed industrial nations, and that their cold instrumental rationality was only able to keep the peace through a stroke of luck.They believe that in these times of unpredictable nations such as Iran and North Korea, or even terrorist groups striving for the bomb, it is no longer possible to rely on the stability of mutual deterrence.Of course there are differences between the four when it comes to political issues. 'A great point of disagreement: Possibly opposed to Lee and definitely to Henry, I consider the American maritime nuclear deployment towards China to be quite exaggerated,' says Schmidt.China! All four of them take a passionate interest in China's rise to its former greatness. Naturally, Schmidt has read Kissinger's new book On China. 'Something is missing. Too much Kissinger, too little China. The book could be called 'On Henry'! Overall, however, it displays great respect towards Chinese civilisation. Germans often mix up civilisation and culture!'Kissinger and Schmidt first met at 1950s end. Where and how exactly - at Harvard or at the America House in Hamburg - is disputed between the two.Kissinger likes to tell the story about how he, before their first meeting, confused Schmidt, introduced to him as an 'up-and-coming politician', with Carlo Schmid, one of the fathers of the German Basic Law. 'This was the more important German I knew.'More than half a century has passed since then, and the dialogue between the two has never stopped. Schmidt explains that they obviously did not always agree when they were still both in office, Schmidt as Federal Chancellor, and Kissinger as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State.During the East-West negotiations in the 1970s, for instance, 'Kissinger was much more sceptical about the closing meeting in Helsinki than me and his boss, Jerry Ford'. They also had opposing views when it came to the Vietnam War: 'He wanted to end the war, but much too slow. I wanted to speed it up.'Were Chile and Cambodia an issue between the two, the overthrow of Allende by Pinochet and the bombardment of Vietnam's neutral neighbour by the Americans? 'Neither Cambodia nor Chile played a big role between us,' Schmidt replies, 'while I have always assumed, but never knew, that Henry was burdened.'What lies at the core of this friendship?'Human dependability,' Kissinger replies. 'I know when Helmut needs to talk, even when he would never ask for it. I know, on the other hand, that he would be there if I needed him.'However, don't they say that friendships cannot exist in politics, we ask Helmut Schmidt.'Yes, this is a mistake!' he grumbles. 'These four people can be sure that one of them does not say anything but what he considers to be his truth.''What he considers to be his truth,' Schmidt repeats. 'What you say in public may differ in some cases.'Isn't there more: Are they not all typical political realists? Well, Schmidt says, 'more influenced by realism than by ideology, that is true for all four of us'. But he does not like the term political realist. 'We would have never used such a term! Why should we stick a label on us?'Realists and internationalists at the same time. 'We do not think nationally when it comes to issues that affect all of us,' says Kissinger. 'It's about real global issues after all, so we discuss them from a global perspective.' Schmidt calls Kissinger, the Jew who fled Germany with his family in 1938, an 'American global citizen'.'I have many friends,' Kissinger continues, 'but I would say that I always end up with these four. Most people do not even know this group exists. In this sense, it's exclusive.'Our meeting in the afternoon before the award ceremony is short. Kissinger wants to go over to Helmut Schmidt's office next to the Reichstag. But he wants to know one more thing before he leaves: What did Lee say when we met him in Singapore? What does he think about the friendship of the four?Lee also talked about trust and added: 'Our minds work in similar ways.' He talks on the phone with Kissinger at least once every two months, he said. They mostly talk about China or about other current major political issues. And one other thing: 'Henry called to console me when my wife Choo passed away.' This touched him.Yes, says Kissinger: 'I called him almost every day back then.' Because in Lee's culture, it is very difficult to express personal grief, he adds. Was he able to console his friend? 'I think, he was consoled by being able to talk about Choo - so yes.'At the end of life, when the final balance sheet is drawn up, one thing remains: friendship, partnership, love. 'If my former wife was still alive, we would be married for almost 70 years now,' George Shultz says. She died 16 years ago from cancer. The (former) husband of his current wife Charlotte also died from cancer. 'So we got married,' says Shultz.A radiant Charlotte Shultz enters the room during our meeting in Berlin. She was Head of Protocol of California under Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.The wives, says Helmut Schmidt, played 'a certain role' in the friendship of the four. Nancy Kissinger is 'a politically interested and intelligent woman who is reserved when expressing her views'. 'The second Mrs Shultz likes to talk, as she is full of impulses.'The atmosphere is completely different when the wives are present, but they are also talking politics. What else are they talking about? 'About age, old age dementia, about the world, and about Dear God!'Just as last year in New York. They met at the Waldorf Astoria. 'There were two different meetings,' says Helmut Schmidt. 'One for several hours with just Shultz, Kissinger, and Schmidt. And then a dinner with all three and the two wives - Mrs Shultz and Nancy.' It was his trip to say goodbye to America. Schmidt happily takes another drag from his cigarette: 'But I'm still alive!'Another trip to America? 'No!' And if a friend needs him? 'I wouldn't rule it out completely, but I have no plans to do so.' He is determined to not make any more big trips. 'Within Europe - that is something else. Or Moscow, that is also something else.'So Moscow would be tempting? 'Yes.' Are there any plans? 'No, nothing is planned.'How to go about plans when you are getting older? - This is what we ask Kissinger. 'You have to choose. The things you can do are limited. So you should be doing things that are important and rewarding. Therefore, each one of our meetings is something special.'Of course, it is important that we see each other, Kissinger adds. 'But there is nothing left we need to tell each other. Nothing will remain unfulfilled because of it. Nevertheless, the loss will be great when one of us passes.'The critical interest in each other is still alive, the constant curiosity. George Shultz says: 'Every once in a while, Helmut sends me one of his speeches. I always read it very thoroughly. And then I read it again.'It usually includes some subtleties you have to search for. He is a careful thinker. But he knows how to think big. Most people say utter nonsense when they are thinking big. When Helmut thinks big, it has meaning.'And so they continue working. And they impress the people around them with their presence and creative power. At this warm evening in May in Berlin, they are sitting next to each other on the podium of the 'Weltsaal' (World Room) of the Federal Foreign Office: George Shultz, 91, Helmut Schmidt, 93, and Henry Kissinger, 89. There is not one person in the room who can withdraw from this touching moment.All three have made history. They comfortably scan the rows in front of them: Shultz, sitting proud and straight with a crimson bow tie; Kissinger, slumped and with a wavering gaze; and between the two, Schmidt in his wheelchair, his hands without cigarettes on his lap.They are well aware of their aura, and enjoy it with the kind of ironic distance of people who have seen too much to take every praise seriously. And who, nevertheless, always enjoy hearing it! You can put on a grim expression. Or grumble a bit. There is nothing that delights people more.Schmidt, who delivers the laudatory speech for awardee Shultz, remembers Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, George Kennan, George Marshall, Eisenhower, and Kennedy. 'George, you are one of the American leaders that established the friendship with the Germans - after two world wars, in which we Germans were your enemies. And for this, I will forever be your thankful friend.'The brief moment together in an adjoining room before the award ceremony is more important to the three than the actual event itself. This is what they were looking forward to. This is why they have travelled from Hamburg, New York, and San Francisco.And this is why Schmidt flew to Singapore one last time.'This is my last visit to this part of the world,' he said at the end of the third day. 'All the best to you, Harry.' - 'For you too,' Lee replies, and his voice is coarse. 'It was an honour to have known you.' They lean towards each other and hug. Very carefully.For a moment everything is quiet in the room. Then Schmidt calls for his bodyguards.

(and can) hold back some project launches in view of the cautious market sentiment,\" she said.\"I'd expect sales of smaller homes to take the lead in the market once the appetite for new homes returns.\"rjscully@sph.com.sg"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The word Durio was established in 1763 and comes from the Malay word \"duri\" which means \"thorns\". Zibethinus, established in 1774, comes from \"zibetto\", which is Italian for \"civet cat\" and a reference to the fruit's strong odour.In 1869, British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described the taste of the fruit in his book The Malay Archipelago: \"It is like a buttery custard flavoured with almonds, intermingled with wafts of flavour that call to mind cream cheese, onion sauce, brown sherry and other incongruities.\"Source: Singapore: The Encyclopedia; Singapore Infopedia1800s2 1800s: Malay coin of satu keping (one denomination)This coin is one of many found near the former Sultan's residence in Kampong Gelam, what is now the Malay Heritage Centre in Kampong Glam.Such coins indicate the history of Singapore as a vibrant trading centre in the Malay world.The coin is inscribed with a date from the Islamic Hijri calendar, 1219, which is equivalent to 1804 in the Gregorian calendar. The coin could be an original piece produced by the British East India Company in 1804 for use in Sumatra and neighbouring areas such as Singapore.But it also could be a merchant token - a private coin issued by traders in times of acute shortage of official coins.Such tokens, produced from 1828, were widely accepted and used in the region until the 1850s.Source: Malay Heritage Centre3 1800s: Coolie trousersTrousers like these were worn by coolies, who formed the backbone of early Singapore's labour force.The coolies were engaged mainly in hard physical labour and worked in the ports, plantations, construction sites and also as rickshaw pullers.Although they came to seek their fortune from the 19th to the 20th century, many served as indentured and unskilled labourers.The word \"coolie\" is believed to have come from the Hindi term Kuli, the name of a native tribe of Gujerat in western India.It is believed that the Kulis were among the first coolies as they were easy to recruit because they lived on the northern Indian coast. The word \"kuli\" also means \"hire\" in Tamil.Source: Asian Civilisations Museum; Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board4 1880s to 1987: Night soil bucketBefore modern sewage was introduced, toilets were rudimentary outfits - no more than a wooden shack with a galvanised metal bucket. Waste was collected and transferred to plantations on the outskirts of the city.The euphemistically named night soil man and his \"32-door limousine\" - the vehicle used to collect human waste - were an everyday sight on the streets of Singapore. Some who remember the night soil collectors say they would put off going to the toilet till the night soil bucket was changed; others claimed they took up smoking to kill the stench in the toilets.Attempts to introduce a town sewage system made little progress until the 1920s due to financial and technical challenges. Night soil collection was present in Singapore until as recently as 1987, when the last two night soil buckets were decommissioned.Source: The Straits Times; National Museum of Singapore; National Heritage Board; Chronicle Of Singapore: Fifty Years Of Headline News5 1819: Treaty between Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Sultan Hussein and Temenggong Abdul Rahman (fascimile)On Feb 6, 1819 , a number of tents were erected on the Padang in preparation for the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. The treaty stated that Sultan Hussein would receive an annual salary of 5,000 Spanish dollars, while the Temenggong would receive 3,000 Spanish dollars a year.In return, the Malay rulers allowed the British to set up a trading port and agreed not to form alliances with other nations.After the treaty was signed, the Union Jack was raised on the beach and the East India Company officers and the Malay leaders celebrated with a banquet.This treaty marks the founding of modern Singapore.Source: Singapore A Biography; National Museum of Singapore6 1820 to 1860s: Brick from an old jail which housed Indian convictsBack in the 19th century, Indian convicts were sent from India to Singapore and used as free labour to construct buildings, lighthouses and roads in Singapore.This brick is recovered from the former site of the 19th-century Singapore Convict Jail in Bras Basah.The convicts sent to Singapore were murderers, thugs, robbers and political prisoners.There were six classes of convicts. The first class, the least threatening, were allowed to leave the jail, while the 5th class had no allowance.Source: National Museum of Singapore7 1820s: Opium pipeAs early as the 1820s, opium smoking was rife in Singapore.Resident William Farquhar farmed out licences to sell opium in return for a fee, and the local consumption was also heavily taxed, making it a profitable business for the colonial masters.In 1848, it was estimated that about 21.5 per cent of the population were opium-smokers. Many of the users were rickshaw pullers and coolies who found relief for their physical pain by smoking opium.Only in the 1920s, partly due to the strengthening anti-opium sentiment in the West, did the British limit the sale of opium.In 1934, the colonial government banned possession of the drug, except for those who could prove it was necessary for their health with a medical practitioner's certificate.Source: National Museum of Singapore; Singapore A Biography; A History Of Singapore 8 1822: First Singapore town planDissatisfied with the haphazard growth of the settlement under Resident William Farquhar, Raffles formed a Town Committee to assist him in planning a new settlement.This plan of the new settlement was drawn by Lieutenant P. Jackson, who was an executive engineer and surveyor.According to this plan, the different migrant communities in Singapore - the Europeans, Chinese, Indians, Arabs and Bugis - were placed in separate ethnic enclaves. However, the migrants did not keep to their enclaves. For example, one can see Hindu temples in Chinatown. Source: National Museum of Singapore9 1833: Singapore ChronicleThe first newspaper in Singapore was started by Francis James Bernard, the son-in-law of William Farquhar, with the backing of the Resident of Singapore, John Crawfurd, Farquhar's successor. The Resident ruled Singapore on behalf of the British East India Company. The first issue was published on Jan 1, 1824. The paper was initially published every fortnight but with the growth of Singapore, it soon became a weekly publication.A second newspaper, The Singapore Free Press And Mercantile Advertiser, started in 1835. The competition drove the Singapore Chronicle out of business in 1837.Source: Singapore Press Holdings; Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board 10 1844: Earliest photo of SingaporeThe dynamism of Singapore's port spurred French customs service officer Alphonse-Eugene-Jules Itier to take this image in 1844. He took this image from Government Hill, now known as Fort Canning. This is one of the four earliest photographic images of Singapore, taken just five years after the invention of the daguerreotype photographic process in 1839.

Bidwell of Swan & Maclaren and opened in November 1899.The hotel has become a Singapore landmark and is associated with a signature cocktail called the Singapore Sling. It was created by bar captain Ngiam Tong Boon in 1915. During the 1920s, this grand old dame hosted literary luminaries such as Joseph Conrad, Rudyard Kipling, Noel Coward and W. Somerset Maugham.The hotel was gazetted as a national monument in 1987 and later re-gazetted in 1995.

Instead of the usual hand towel, the plusher souvenir version is a bath towel with the words \"Good Morning\" embroidered in gold. Source: The Straits Times14 1920s: A Chettiar's tableThe Chettiars were among the few immigrant communities who came with investment capital to Singapore and were the early money-lenders in the island's history.Members of the Chettiar banking community here often led austere lifestyles and sent most of their income back home to Chettinad in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.The men lived collectively in shophouses known as kittangis. They would each rent a small office space, which doubled as their sleeping area at night.This desk and stool belonged to Mr Ramasamy V.S. Karuppiah Chettiar, a money-lender who lived in Market Street from the 1920s to 1940s. At one time, there were seven kittangis in Market Street, housing about 300 to 400 Chettiar companies.Source: Asian Civilisations Museum (on loan)15 1920s: Tiger BalmThis herbal balm which relieves aches and pains was introduced to Rangoon, Burma, by Chinese herbalist Aw Chu Kin in the late 1870s.When he died, his sons Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par brought their father's herbal balm to Singapore in the 1920s.Tiger Balm has since developed into a global brand sold in more than 100 countries including Australia, Sweden, Egypt and Mexico.The Balm, with its distinctive hexagonal packaging, is also closely associated with Haw Par Villa (formerly known as Tiger Balm Gardens), a villa and gardens built by Mr Aw Boon Haw in 1937. In 1988, the Singapore Tourism Board took over the running of the Tiger Balm Gardens and renamed it Haw Par Villa. The attraction, known for its depiction of the different levels of hell, is still in operation.Source: Singapore: The Encyclopedia; Haw Par Corporation16 1923: Tin trunk belonging to Tang Choon KengWhen Singapore's pioneer retailer Tang Choon Keng arrived in Singapore from Swatow, China, in 1923, he carried a tin trunk and one leather suitcase filled with linen and lace.He peddled his wares from door to door until he earned enough money to set up his first store along River Valley Road in 1932.In 1940, he expanded his business and took over six adjacent shops across the street and built a three-storey building. This was the first CK Tang Department Store.It was only after the war that Mr Tang bought the piece of land on Orchard Road, where the current department store - now known as Tangs and a landmark in Singapore's prime shopping district - still stands. Mr Tang died in 2000.Source: Once Upon A Tang; CK Tang; Singapore: The Encyclopedia17 1932: Tiger BeerAsia Pacific Breweries was established in 1931. It opened its first brewery in Singapore and launched Tiger Beer in 1932. The famous advertising slogan, It's Time For A Tiger, was believed to have been conceived in the 1930s, and in 1946, English writer Anthony Burgess used it for the title of one of his books.Singapore's first locally brewed beer is now available in more than 60 countries.Source: The Straits Times; Asia Pacific Breweries website 18 1942: Tin mug from a Malay RegimentIn 1933, the Malay Regiment - an all-Malay military force - was formed at Port Dickson, Malaya, under the command of British officers.During the Japanese invasion of Singapore in 1942, the regiment showed bravery and loyalty in the Battle of Pasir Panjang, and lost a total of 159 men.Lieutenant Ibrahim Sidek, who was part of this regiment, was executed in February 1942 for defying Japanese orders as he refused to remove his Malay Regiment uniform. His body was never found. His wife Sharifah Khadijah Hamid treasured this mug as a keepsake of her husband.Source: Reflections at Bukit Chandu; Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board 19 1942-1945: Tapioca Food was scarce during the war years and the humble tapioca became a staple food for residents of Singapore. As trade routes were disrupted, the Japanese initiated campaigns for people to grow their own crops and become self-sufficient. For example, the large rubber plantations between Geylang Serai and Jalan Eunos were cleared to grow tapioca. Tapioca was used to make bread and even the skin was not thrown away. It was washed, cut finely and boiled so that it resembled noodles. Source: Memories At Old Ford Factory20 1942 to 1945: Sook Ching massacre victim's walletLittle is known about Dr J.C. Chen of 26 Wilkinson Road, but his wallet and stethoscope were found in the Siglap area along what was formerly known as Jalan Puay Poon, together with items from other victims of the infamous Sook Ching massacre.The words Sook Ching mean \"purge through cleansing\" in Chinese and this was what the Japanese occupying forces set out to do.After the fall of Singapore, the Japanese systematically hunted down Chinese who had organised boycotts and fund-raisers to support China's war effort against Japan. They also targeted those who had fought against the Japanese.Those deemed anti-Japanese were taken to Changi, Punggol and Bedok, where they were executed. Many graves were discovered in these areas after the war. The exact death toll is not known. While the Japanese claimed about 5,000 were killed, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce estimated the figure to be around 40,000.Source: National Museum of Singapore; Memories At Old Ford Factory21 1950s: Redifussion setBefore television, there was Redifussion, Singapore's first cable-transmitted commercial radio station, which provided entertainment for thousands of listeners.Fans had their own Redifussion sets at home or gathered at coffee shops to listen to their favourite rock 'n' roll tunes or master storytellers such as Lee Dai Sor and Ong Toh who spun stories in Chinese dialects. These storytellers became household names.Subscription to the station continued to grow into the 1970s, but that came to a halt when the Speak Mandarin Campaign was launched in 1979 and Redifussion was required to stop all dialect programmes by 1982. Subscription subsequently plunged.Redifussion was relaunched this year as an online-based station.Source: The Straits Times; National Museum of Singapore;Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board22 1950s to 1960s: Ticket to New World Amusement ParkIn the post-war years, amusement parks were the places where families went to for after-dark entertainment. Visitors paid admission fees to the parks on top of separate charges for various entertainment offerings.New World Amusement Park was opened in Kitchener Road in 1923 by Peranakan merchant Ong Boon Tat and his younger brother Ong Peng Hock. It was known for its boxing and wrestling matches, open-air theatre and a cabaret. One of the headline cabaret acts was Rose Chan, dubbed the queen of striptease, whose famous act involved dancing with a python. The park closed in 1987 when Shaw Organisation sold it to a property developer.The two other amusement parks were Great World in Kim Seng Road, which closed in 1964 although the restaurants and cinemas remained till 1978, and Gay World in Geylang, which closed around 2000.Source: The Straits Times; National Heritage Board; Singapore: The Encyclopedia; Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board 23 1900s: Zubir Said's pianoThis is the Strohmenger grand piano which belonged to the late Zubir Said, who composed Singapore's national anthem Majulah Singapura.The song was originally commissioned by the City Council to commemorate the re-opening of the Victoria Theatre after its renovations in 1958.It was later adapted and unveiled as the national anthem in December 1959.Mr Zubir was a self-taught musician who began his career in Malay opera. He composed music for Malay films from the 1940s to 1960s and was a nationalist who believed in music as a galvanising social force.He died on Nov 16, 1987, at the age of 80, leaving behind four daughters and a son.Source: Malay Heritage Centre; Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board; Singapore: The Encyclopedia24 1950s onwards: Chicken riceIf Singaporeans were asked to pick a national dish, chances are they would plump for chicken rice.The tender poached white chicken on fragrant white rice which reminds Singaporeans abroad of home may be called Hainanese chicken rice, but members of the Hainanese community say the version in Singapore is very different from the version in Hainan.The original Hainanese chicken rice was actually a ball of cooked rice, about the size of two tennis balls, with a chicken filling. The rice ball was carried by farmers to the fields and was not served with chilli or dark soya sauce.The Hainanese Chicken Rice dish is said to have taken root in areas such as Middle Road, Purvis Street and Koek Road more than 60 years ago.Source: The Straits Times; Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board25 1955: Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company driver tagSingapore in the 1950s and 1960s was troubled by riots and industrial unrest and the Hock Lee bus riot was one of the worst.The drivers, conductors and inspectors from the Hock Lee Amalgamated Bus Company went on strike in April 1955. They were part of the communist-controlled Singapore Bus Workers' Union and had been dismissed after serving strike notices on the bus company.The strikers locked themselves in the company's bus garages in Alexandra Road and picketed outside the garages. Violent riots broke out a month later. Chinese school students who supported the strikers joined in the riot. Four people were killed and 31 injured.The strike was seen as being orchestrated by the communist-led union for political rather than industrial purpose; the union wanted to destabilise the political system and create conditions for a takeover.Source: Singapore A Biography; The Straits Times; Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board26 1960s: Meat safeBefore there were refrigerators, families used these ventilated cupboards to store their provisions.The cupboards, with a wire mesh to keep flies away, were usually raised or hung from the ceiling to keep pests away from food items.Source: National Museum of Singapore27 1960: HDB key envelopeGetting the key to one's first Housing Board flat has become something of a rite of passage for many Singaporeans.These envelopes that hold the keys have been used since 1960, and are still in use today.Government flats house about 82 per cent of Singaporeans today, but that was not always the case.In 1960, only 9 per cent of Singaporeans lived in government flats. The HDB was set up on Feb 1, 1960, to succeed the Singapore Improvement Trust, and the board was tasked with meeting the nation's housing needs.At that time, many people were living in unhygienic slums and crowded squatter settlements.

The theatre was finally built at the corner of Clemenceau Avenue and River Valley Road in 1963. A total of $856,279 was collected from the public for construction. The total cost was estimated at $2.2 million.The building, which featured a cantilevered roof and an open-air auditorium, was designed by architect Alfred Wong and hosted important events and performances such as National Day rallies, concerts and university convocations.The theatre was demolished in 1986.Source: The Straits Times; Singapore: The Encyclopedia 30 1964: MerlionThe Merlion symbol was designed by Fraser Brunner, curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium, in 1964 for the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board - now the Singapore Tourism Board - and was its corporate logo from 1966 to 1997.The symbol has a lion head and a fish body, referencing the legend of Prince Sang Nila Utama who saw a lion when he came to Singapore and named the island Singapura or Lion City. The fish tail alludes to Singapore as a port city.A sculpture of the Merlion, now in the Merlion Park, was created in 1972 by sculptor Lim Nang Seng.Source: Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board; www.stb.gov.sg; Singapore: The Encyclopedia 31 1965: Setron TVSetron Limited produced the first locally assembled television sets in September 1965.By the 1970s, it had become a household brand in Singapore, known for the durability and reliability of its television sets. From producing just 400 TV sets a month in 1966, the company ramped up production to 2,500 sets a month in 1973.In 1986, the company became a subsidiary of Sony Corporation Japan and its name was changed to Sony Singapore.

The commemorative issue came as a set of three and the design incorporated the three fundamentals of a young nation: Workers, Factory and Housing.It was designed by the then Ministry of Culture. Before these stamps were issued, Singapore had used British Straits Settlement Stamps, Malaysia stamps and the State of Singapore stamps.Source: Singapore Philatelic Museum34 1966: 4-D ticketBuying a four-digit lottery number, or what is commonly known as 4-D, is a habit for many Singaporeans who hope that the ticket will be their passport to riches.4-D was legalised in 1966, in order to thwart illegal gambling operators.It was derived from an earlier three-digit version, which commenced in January 1962.Source: Singapore Pools; Chronicle Of Singapore: Fifty Years Of Headline News35 1968: SIA KebayaDesigned by French designer Pierre Balmain, the iconic sarong kebaya was unveiled in 1968 as the stewardess' uniform for Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA).A special batik design with multi-coloured flowers was used and a border was added for the hems, cuffs, collar and front.The traditional cut was also updated. The kebaya was form-fitting and had a round collar.The Singapore Girl's sarong kebaya comes in four colours, each representing a different rank.Following the restructuring of MSA in 1972, Malaysian Airline System and Singapore Airlines (SIA) were formed. The sarong kebaya uniforms followed SIA.The same year, the Singapore Girl - a symbol of grace, hospitality and top-notch service standards - was created and she became the face of the airline.SIA has evolved from a regional airline into a global brand which flies to 63 destinations in 34 countries.Source: Singapore Airlines36 1960s to 1970s: No Long Hair posterThe hippie subculture in the United States started during the 1960s and spread to many countries.Posters stating that \"Males with long hair will be attended to last\" were displayed in all government offices in June 1972.This was a time when the authorities associated men with long hair with drug-taking hippies in the West and took this unusual step to discourage men from keeping their hair long.The Ministry of Home Affairs defined long hair as hair falling across the forehead and touching the eyebrows, hair covering the ears or reaching below an ordinary shirt collar.The posters reflected the mood of a young nation concerned with \"corrupting\" Western influences.The civil service took the advisory against keeping long hair seriously. In 1974, a total of 8,172 male civil servants and national servicemen were warned for sporting long hair. Among them, 11 were fined, three resigned from their jobs and one was dismissed.Source: The Straits Times37 1971: Rain treeAt 9.30am on Nov 7, 1971, Dr Goh Keng Swee, who was the acting prime minister at the time, planted a sapling (the tree now) on the summit of Mount Faber, launching the first Tree Planting Day.On that day, volunteers planted 8,400 trees and 21,677 shrubs and creepers. While this was the first Tree Planting Day, Singapore had already started on its journey to become a garden city after then-premier Lee Kuan Yew planted a tree at Farrer Circus on June 16, 1963.

Introduced in 1971 by the Singapore Telephone Board, there were believed to be tens of thousands of these Coinafon phones in operation in the 1980s. The Singapore Telephone Board later stopped selling the phones - though it is not known when exactly - and the phones were subsequently sold by other vendors. Today, the phones have become collector's items and are displayed in fashionable shops and cafes.

The campaign aimed to highlight the importance of graceful and polite behaviour in a Singapore that was increasingly becoming more urban and crowded.The courtesy campaign was one of many campaigns launched to change the behaviour of Singaporeans. The Stop At Two campaign in the 1970s encouraged Singaporeans to have two children and the ongoing Speak Mandarin campaign, which was also launched in 1979, exhorts Chinese Singaporeans to switch from speaking dialect to Mandarin.Singapore's many campaigns and their accompanying radio jingles helped give the country its \"nanny state'' reputation. Since March 2001, the National Courtesy Campaign has been incorporated into the Singapore Kindness Movement.Source: National Archives of Singapore; The Straits Times; http://kindness.sg; Chronicle Of Singapore: Fifty Years Of Headline News40 1981: Vanda Miss JoaquimIn a bid to foster national pride and identity, a national flower was named in 1981.The Vanda Miss Joaquim is a hybrid of two orchids - Vanda hookeriana and Vanda teres.It was named by the first director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Mr H.N.

A branch office of the Industrial & Commercial Bank was on the ground floor while a nightclub was on the second floor.A nation was transfixed by images of rescue workers working around the clock to rescue the scores trapped under the rubble. Thirty-three people died. The tragedy rallied Singaporeans from all walks of life. Companies contributed food and drinks to the rescue teams, while people queued to donate blood.The panel investigating the incident said the structural design of the building was \"grossly inadequate\" and had caused the collapse.

A place for dinner on the way home from work or after jogging at MacRitchie Reservoir.Long House food centre in Upper Thomson Road has held a special place in the hearts of patrons for the past 13 years.But this week a deal was closed to sell the site - formerly a Shell station and garage, a fast-food outlet and a Kopitiam - to a developer for more than $45 million.\"It's such a pity,\" said Yio Chu Kang resident and sales manager Jerry Tan, 32, as he sat down for his weekly meal at Ah Hui Big Prawn Noodle, which draws more than 300 customers a day. \"It's one of the few places along Upper Thomson Road with a variety of good hawker food at affordable prices.\"The popular food stretch still houses a few coffee shops, like Hwa Nam Restaurant and The Roti Prata House, but there is nothing nearby in the same league as Long House, which has about 15 stalls offering a variety of dishes from duck rice to Western food. Most of its stalls open till about 10pm.\"The closest I can think of is Shunfu market,\" said Thomson resident and jogger Eve Teo, 27. But that is located far from the main road and opens mostly for breakfast and lunch. \"I will miss the convenience of Long House. It's open until late and the chicken rice is worth the calories.\"Long House was originally a row of shops in Jalan Besar stadium and was popular with footballers and fans. The food centre moved to Upper Thomson about 13 years ago after the stadium was renovated.Retired lawyer Ng Choon Gim, 62, oversees Long House on behalf of his family's business, Sin Hin Lee Investment, which owns the Upper Thomson site.It used to house a Shell petrol station with a car workshop in the 1960s and 70s. Mr Ng's father, the late Mr Ng Aun Khim, ran it as a local dealer for more than 20 years. But when Shell downsized operations in 1979, the late Mr Ng bought the property for $678,000 the following year.The family has now sold the 1,575.6 sq m site to developer TEE Land for $45.2 million.\"I thought the property market is close to its peak and it's time to let go,\" said Mr Ng. \"It's a good profit but all thanks to the acumen of my late father.\"TEE plans to redevelop the place - near Marymount MRT and the upcoming Upper Thomson stations - into residential and commercial units.After the Ng family bought the land in 1980, they leased it to American fast-food chain A&W for eight years and food-court operator Kopitiam for two.It was vacant for some time before Long House moved in around 2000, bringing some stalls from the original Jalan Besar eatery, including the barbecue stingray, mee pok and char kway teow stalls.Today, only four hawkers from the Jalan Besar Long House remain: Ah Hui Big Prawn Noodle, Bugis Street Chuen Chuen Chicken Rice, Boon Pisang Goreng and the popular Soon Kee (Boneless) Lor Duck Rice.\"The duck is tender, the rice is loose and fragrant and the chilli is flavoursome\" said public servant Jimmy Tan, 30, who first visited the stall about a decade ago.He remembers Long House fondly for 5am cycling meet-ups with his kakis when the floors were \"still wet as they had just been cleaned\".Mr Ng is searching for a new home for Long House's 15 stalls. He estimates the move will take place in four to six months after he receives money from the sale.He will leave it up to individual stall owners to decide whether the stalls move en masse.Ah Hui Big Prawn Noodle boss Tan Ah Hui, 68, is already considering relocating to Block 280, Bishan Street 24.\"We knew of the sale only this week,\" said Mr Ong Tan Heng, 60, owner of Soon Kee (Boneless) Lor Duck Rice. \"We expect other coffee-shop owners to approach us in the next few days.\"Madam Yong Fong, 64, owner of Bugis Street Chuen Chuen Chicken Rice, said: \"Hopefully the four stalls from the original Jalan Besar site can move together. We have been friends for so many years and work well together. We want to keep our branding too.\"Soon Kee's Mr Ong added: \"When we moved from Jalan Besar, our regulars came with us. Moving shouldn't be a problem.\"For Boon Pisang Goreng owner Rose Boon, Long House at Upper Thomson holds special memories. It is the place where she spent most time with her late husband, Mr Boon Fong Juan, selling fried bananas. He died three years ago and she inherited the business.\"Of course, I will miss this place,\" the 35-year-old said tearfully. \"I spend more time here than at home. My regulars have become friends. But when we close down, I hope to rest one or two months and take my children on a well-deserved holiday.\"Echoing the sentiments of many Upper Thomson residents, Mr Dan Lee, 23, said: \"Wherever they go, I hope the stallholders remember to tell us. I'll miss having one of the best food centres at my doorstep.\"kashc@sph.com.sg"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Six will set up shop at Balestier Market along Balestier Road, while five are moving to a coffee shop in Jalan Besar, near Jalan Besar Stadium. The owners of four other stalls, including Longhouse Roasted Meat and Asia Beef Noodle, have already vacated their stalls to look for new jobs or to return to their home countries.Longhouse is run by Mr Ng Choon Gim, 62, whose late father bought the property for $678,000 in 1980.The site was previously owned by oil giant Shell, which ran a petrol station there for more than 20 years. In 1980, fast-food chain A&W leased the site for eight years, followed by food court operator Kopitiam Group, which leased the premises for two years.The premises were vacant from 1990 to 2000 when Longhouse set up shop there. Mr Ng took over the business eight years ago, and turned it into the successful food haunt it is today.He bought new equipment for all the stalls, organised a central supply of ingredients, and also tested many other stalls before getting the current crop of hawkers that have, as he says, \"stood the test of time\".He admits that the sale of Longhouse was \"very sudden\", so he looked for stalls the hawkers could move to, including a potential spot in China Street. The hawkers, who do not have any contracts with him, will also be able to take the equipment he bought for the stalls to their new premises.He says that he encouraged those who have already left the food centre to look for other jobs, and gave them each a hongbao.He hopes that the existing hawkers continue the Longhouse legacy after they move, by adding \"Longhouse\" to their signboards.\"It's my moral obligation to see them succeed,\" he says. \"Being a hawker is a hard life and if they produce good food, they deserve the credit.\"His Vietnam-born supervisors Vien Peh, 32, and Joey Kok, 28, who are Singapore permanent residents, have been helping him to manage the food centre. After the closure, they will continue to help the stalls moving to Jalan Besar.Some of these include the popular Soon Kee Lor Duck Rice stall, Best Western Pasta & Grill, and Te Wei Popiah & Rojak.Te Wei is run by husband-and-wife team Ong Tze Ghee, 41, who makes rojak, and wife Ong Wu Yun, 40, who makes popiah.With the move to Jalan Besar, they are likely to sell only their popular rojak, as Mr Ong says that it is \"too much work\" to make popiah as well.High rental is also a concern, Mrs Ong says.She says in Mandarin: \"Beginning at a new place can be tough. But as long as the food suits people, they will come back. We hope our regulars will remember us.\"Mr Ong is the nephew of Mr Ong Tan Heng, 60, owner of Soon Kee Lor Duck Rice. To save costs, uncle and nephew will share the stall in Jalan Besar. The rent there is about $1,000 more than what the elder Mr Ong is paying at Longhouse.He says: \"I won't stop just because we have to move. I will continue working until I cannot work anymore. I was surprised when we heard the news, but at least the stalls are moving together.\"Mr David Foo, 54, who runs Best Western Pasta & Grill, says: \"We'll try and see how the new location works out. We have a stable crowd here, and I don't know what traffic there will be like. It will be a new challenge for us.\"Balestier Market will welcome other popular stalls such as Ah Hui Big Prawn Noodle, Bugis Street Chuen Chuen Chicken Rice and Boon Pisang Goreng.Mr Tan Ah Hui, 68, of Ah Hui Big Prawn Noodle, had initially considered moving to a coffee shop in Bishan, but decided to move with his fellow hawkers to Balestier instead.He says: \"The Bishan space was too small. I'm not worried about losing customers. Many have been eating our food since they were children. I hope to get new customers as well.\"Mr Richard Ang of civil engineering company KTC Group, which manages Balestier Market, tells SundayLife! that the first stall from Longhouse, Longhouse Thai Cuisine, opens next month. The other stalls are likely to open by May.The new tenants add to other new entrants such as Balestier Fish Soup, which moved there in February from Sungei Kadut industrial estate.One of the workers at the stall, Ms Tay Bee Yong, 56, says: \"We know that the Longhouse hawkers are coming here. Hopefully, that will increase the traffic. It can be quite quiet now because when diners come, they see that there are empty stalls. When there's more variety, people will come back.\"Mr Ang is also looking to woo the tenants of other hawker centres, including those from hawker institution Lavender Food Square, which is slated to close later this year.The hawker centre and the neighbouring Eminent Plaza will be replaced by ARC 380, a 16-storey freehold development with more than 160 office and retail units, slated to be ready by 2018.Longhouse owner Mr Ng, a former property lawyer, says: \"People ask me what's the secret to Longhouse. There is no secret. We have good ingredients, discipline and skills. I am pleasantly surprised that this place has become an institution. We constantly benchmark our food against the best in Singapore.\"Will the standard of food remain high when the hawkers move? Diners that SundayLife! speak to are hopeful.Housewife Maureen Goh, 53, who visits Longhouse every few weeks, says: \"I'm glad that the hawkers informed us of where they are going. Many just end up disappearing. So I feel that they are clearly proud of their trade and will continue to do well.\"Retired engineer Marcus Fong, 60, who lives in the Thomson area, says: \"It is a pity to see Longhouse go. I do hope the food tastes the same in their new locations.\"euniceq@sph.com.sgWHO'S GOING WHEREBALESTIER MARKETWhere: 411 Balestier RoadBugis Street Chuen Chuen Chicken RiceWhat: Tender roast or white chicken with fragrant rice.

Everyone from H&M to Zara to ASOS,\" he recalls. \"Suddenly, there were too many mass-produced products on the market.\"At the same time, people were also starting to explore their individualism. They didn't want to go to a party where everyone was wearing the same Topshop dress. So they started to source for handmade, unique products with stories,\" says the DIY entrepreneur, 31, who has since expanded his range and co-founded Tyrwhitt General Company, a shop selling items from local crafters, makers and artisans. It is in Tyrwhitt Road.Like Mr Chen, Singaporeans are devoting themselves to craftsmanship as handmade-in-Singapore goods gain more credibility and cachet.Local crafters are serious about making wares - from hand-bound books to home-poured candles - with such finesse that they fully dispel the myth that DIY products are cheap and shoddy.Some Singapore crafters have even quit their jobs to turn what started as hobbies into small businesses, while others soldier on with their passion in their backyards or kitchens after work. More are also enrolling in craft classes to hone their skills and marketing their goods by collaborating with indie stores and online craft marketplaces.Singapore craft-makers report that interest in their products has grown over the last year, even if prices for their handmade goods are sometimes higher than those of store-bought items. High costs are often attributed to expensive materials and labour, which often lead companies that make furniture and fashion, for example, to outsource to other countries.Ms Mandy Leena Tan started her chemical-free skincare label Mandy T last June in her home kitchen and charges between $39 for bath salt and $59 for body cream. She declines to reveal sales figures.\"There will always be a group of consumers who prefer to pay for cheaper mass-produced products that hide behind international labels,\" says Ms Tan, who is in her late 30s. \"But I have seen a growing trend of niche consumers in Singapore, both local and expatriate, who appreciate well-designed handmade products. They are also prepared to pay a little more for the quality.\"Account executive Genevie Yeo bought three hand-bound journals from book-binding business dddots last year for $80 each. She was willing to pay what some might consider a high price for what are essentially blank notebooks because she wanted to own and use a unique item.\"It is one of a kind because each page is woven together by hand. I think this is meaningful work and I'm not just paying for the item, but for the time and effort invested in the craft,\" says Ms Yeo, 34.The increase in people making their own products mirrors a worldwide trend, dubbed \"the maker movement\", which has been gathering steam in the past couple of years. This is where crafters from America to Indonesia have come together in their own countries to form a community selling self-made products.Etsy, a global e-commerce website for handmade or vintage items, has been credited with kick-starting the maker movement when it started in 2005. It now has more than one million artisan sellers. The site, which is used by many Singaporean crafters, made US$1.3 billion (S$1.6 billion) in revenue last year.While there are no official figures on how many crafters are in Singapore, Crafty Singapore Team - The Original Singapore Handmade Team, a group which organises Etsy makers here, has 460 members. This figure includes non-crafters, who can join the group as well.A local version of Etsy has sprouted too.In 2012, Mr Joel Leong and Mr Melvin Tiong, both 28, co-founded Haystakt, an online marketplace for crafters to sell their products. Every maker gets his own page, which he manages by listing products and uploading pictures of new items. Haystakt also has a related Tumblr page, which has interviews with the makers of brands it carries.Haystakt now carries about 70 local brands, such as theKANG, which makes handcrafted adornments and accessories, and Wheniwasfour, which sells notebooks and bags with a Singaporean twist. Apart from local designs, the website also has 80 overseas labels from cities such as San Francisco and Hong Kong.The website recently launched \"crowd-determined\" pricing for project prototypes, in which an item becomes cheaper as more people pre-order it. Those who order earlier get an \"early-bird bonus\": For every person who buys the item after you do, you get a rebate.The owners take a 5 per cent cut from crafters for every item sold through its shop or crowdpriced.One successful project was Skinny Wallet by local company Shiok, which sold 100 of its ultra-thin wallet for $52.27 each - down from the initial price of $63.99 - over 28 days in March.Mr Leong, who quit working for his family's textile business to set up Haystakt, says he started the venture after seeing many of his crafter friends trying to sell their products. \"The traffic on the site picked up organically as more people shared about it online and through word of mouth. Singaporean consumers often ask why they have to pay so much for a label that they don't know about. But increasingly, we see people who want to buy, not only because it's handmade, but also because there's a story behind it.\"Mr Leong says the site tracks buyers browsing and notice that they scroll all the way down a page to read about the people, inspiration and process behind a product. Skinny Wallet, for example, is the brainchild of two Singapore architecture-trained craftsmen who lovingly describe the concept for their minimalist wallet on their Haystakt page.Besides a marketplace to sell their stuff on, Singapore craftsmen and makers have other support groups. These include Makers Of Singapore, a non-profit initiative started earlier this year by four university students to raise awareness of the local crafts scene, and Singapore Makers, which was launched in July last year by creative events company owner William Hooi to bring together crafters through events and talks.One crafter, who was looking for like-minded people, decided to set up her Singapore version of an Etsy Craft Party, which happens every June 6 around the world.Last Friday, Ms Salinah Zailani, who runs a home-based craft business, Simply-4-Love, selling bespoke felt accessories and bouquets, threw a party for fellow Etsy sellers at the Goodman Arts Centre. Participants paid $10 to take part in craft work, which included embroidery floss and rubber stamps. About 45 people turned up - double the number who attended her first party last year.Ms Salinah, who started her business in 2011 and runs it with her sister, says: \"When you do your own craft business, you are always alone and you don't really know who else is doing it out there. When people signed up for the first party, I was surprised. I couldn't believe there were so many other crafters too.\"I think that it's good to meet up because we can learn techniques from one another, if we are willing to share.\"But the road to becoming a full-fledged maker is often a bumpy one for those who have tried to turn their passion into a business. After two years of running menswear accessories brand Oldman Handmade, which specialises in brightly coloured and patterned bow ties, suspenders and ties, designer Maureen Koh, 24, is considering closing shop.Ms Koh, who received a diploma in fashion merchandising from The Academy of Fashion Professions in 2011, says: \"Everything in my business is handmade in Singapore, so the cost is very high, and bow ties are not a high-profit business. It is a struggle to find that perfect ratio between passion and profits. I need to make a profit to keep my passion going. The cost of doing business in Singapore is simply too high.\"She cannot afford a storefront, so her accessories, which cost $69 for a bow tie to $129 for a pair of suspenders, are sold on a consignment basis in multi-label concept stores such as Tyrwhitt General Company and The Corner Shop in Far East Plaza. Consignment means the stores take 40 per cent of her profits.The three seamstresses she hires to help her make her thrice-yearly collections have to be paid, which takes another 25 per cent of her profits. And then there are the material and packaging costs.While the maker movement is gaining much buzz in Singapore, it could also prove to be the crafters' undoing. Ms Koh says: \"The word 'handmade' has been exploited and has become a marketing gimmick. It's not exclusive or appreciated by customers any more. I have not given up yet, but I will have to see how my current collection sells and then decide what to do.\"natashaz@sph.com.sgvlydia@sph.com.sgkeziatoh@sph.com.sgGSH CONSERVESMr Joey Gan quit his job as a conservation officer at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve last September to start GSH Conserves, a food label selling jams and spreads. From making the seven items to marketing the food label, the 31-year-old does it all himself.His journey to make jam was sparked when he watched videos by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which show the cruel conditions under which animals are reared before they are slaughtered for the dining table.He says: \"It got me thinking about the ethics of getting food to our table, be it plant or animal, and how to make it better. I appreciate the food process and I wanted to show that I could change the way we impact the environment around us.\"He says: \"I had wanted to start a cafe, which uses sustainably sourced coffee, but the scene is so saturated, so I decided to put that on hold. Making jam was something I could start small.\"He and his wife Priscilla, a 30-year-old dentist, decided to make jam their business as it was a \"niche, untouched market in Singapore\".GSH Conserves uses the initials of his dialect name, Gan Soon Hock. He makes jam using fruit which are available from the region, such as passionfruit, dragonfruit and lychee. \"There are so many tasty fruit in the region which people might not think to use in jam. It was just a matter of applying a Western technique to Asian fruit.\"For the environmentally conscious man, getting fruit from the region also cut down his carbon footprint as they did not have to be imported from far.He used $10,000 of his savings to get started. The amount goes into renting a small kitchen in MacPherson, which he works out of three times a week, and buying produce from Pasir Panjang wholesale market and jam bottles from Malaysia.Mr Gan has sold more than 1,800 bottles since he started last October. A 50ml jar costs $4, while a bigger version, at 180ml, costs $10. Six local cafes, restaurants and retailers, such as Overdoughs in Middle Road and The Gardens Shop in Singapore Botanic Gardens, stock his spreads. He has also paired up with two online stores, Naiise (www.naiise.com) and HipVan (www.hipvan.com), to sell his jams there.He has some \"battle scars\" which he collected along the way, including splatters and burns from stirring hot jam and a finger tip which was sliced off during food preparation.His plan for the rest of the his financial year is to grow the business by getting more local bakeries and cafes to carry his jams and improve the brand's presence. He is also looking to hire staff to help beef up operations.He admits that he is not drawing a steady salary now and his wife is the breadwinner. The couple, who have no children, are adjusting to their changed financial situation. \"We eat out a lot less now and cook more at home, and we think twice about eating at fancy places. We're just more careful with money. I really want to do this and it's something I believe in.\"He adds: \"If it's not looking up, I'll probably take it part-time. I started the business, giving it my full concentration. Now that I know what goes into making the jams, I think I can concurrently run it with a full-time job.\"Natasha Ann ZachariahTHE FINGERSMITH LETTERPRESSCapturing local flavour is key to Ms Jacqueline Goh's work.Her hand-printed postcards, for example, come with boxes to be checked off for each uniquely Singaporean experience: speaking Singlish, reserving a table with a tissue packet and shopping at a pasar malam (night market in Malay).Ms Goh, 25, says of her Things... In Singapore design series: \"I love sending postcards when I travel and local postcards often have symbols such as the Merlion, but I didn't want something so predictable.\"She started her craft business, The Fingersmith Letterpress (www.thefingersmithletterpress.com), last November, using the art of relief printing on paper.The tools of her trade are massive: a one-tonne Heidelberg press dating back to the 1950s, which she bought from a family friend for about $6,000 and had to crane-lift into her home; and a $3,000 second-hand \"guillotine\" which cuts paper and weighs about 200kg.Her equipment takes pride of place in a 40 sq m backyard studio - which cost $50,000 to construct, a loan from her parents - in her family's semidetached home. Her father, 51, is a managing director in a refinery processing company, while her mother, 55, is a housewife.Other start-up costs such as materials, machinery and training - Ms Goh went to Sydney and Melbourne for letterpress printing classes in 2012, paying A$2,000 (S$2,337) - hit around $30,000 in total.She paid for it with her takings from waitressing and teaching art while reading a business diploma at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and, later, a design communication degree at Lasalle College of the Arts.She was introduced to letterpress printing while at Lasalle, when a video was shown in class of a letterpress machine and what it could do.\"I am an old soul and don't like staring at the computer screen, but I like the touch, smell and feel of paper. I love working with my hands,\" explains Ms Goh, who is single and graduated from Lasalle two years ago.The craft also appeals to her because it blends modern technology and old-style illustrations.She sells her postcards on online craft marketplace Etsy and stores such as Naiise and Cat Socrates, making about $2,000 a month in sales.Takings are still low, she says, after factoring in the cost for paper and ink.Starting out in the craft industry has also taught her about being more business savvy.She charged a business $300 to design its logo last year, not realising the market rate is close to $2,000.Still, she says: \"This craft is something I would do for free because I love it, so it is difficult to place a price tag on my work.\"There are other business concerns.Renting a studio outside is not an option, she says. \"If I paid about $3,000 a month in rent, I would be slogging to push out my work to pay that.\"Crafters who do this would slog but find that they cannot afford the rent, and might lose their passion.\"Kezia TohPRINTING A LOGO ON A POSTCARDStep 1: Ms Goh mixes white and dark blue ink on a glass tile to produce a sky blue colour.Step 2: She scrapes the blended ink off the tile and coats it on the ink machine roller on her Heidelberg press. A lever is pulled to spread the ink evenly on the roller.Step 3: An etching of a design is done on a polymer plate and pasted on the base of the machine. A stack of paper goes into the machine. When Ms Goh starts up the press, ink coats the etched polymer plate and the design is pressed onto paper. After each use, she cleans the press by wiping the roller with kerosene.COOKIE CUTTERThe death of her grandmother in 2009 made Ms Sandy Ng realise that she \"didn't want to live with a big 'what if'\". So she quit her corporate communications job in 2009 to become a full-time crafter.She had enjoyed making things with her hands as a child, but had lost that passion when she began studying and pursuing her career.A trip to Japan in 2005 revived her interest. \"Meeting people who appreciated arts and culture, and having time to slow down and understand myself reminded me there's more to life than the five Cs,\" she says.When she returned to Singapore, she began following craft blogs and crafting in her spare time. But it was not till 2009 that she took the plunge.\"When my grandmother died, I realised life is short. I was in my late 20s and I thought if I was going to fail, it would be best to fail young,\" says Ms Ng, now 34.She spent six months after quitting her job just experimenting, making everything from cards to notebooks to bags in various styles, before realising she liked creating plush toys most.It took another six months of choosing fabrics, making patterns and sewing before the self-taught crafter refined her techniques and developed the distinctive shifty-eyed look of her toy characters.\"I try to give them a child-like look. I want my pieces to celebrate and encourage a child-like imagination and playfulness,\" says the married mother of a 10-month-old son. She works from a spare room in the East Coast condominium she owns with her private banker husband.Ms Ng spends hours doodling cartoons and designs. Once she decides on a design, pattern and fabric, sewing takes up to two days.Her toys, pillows and tote bags sell from $30 to $75. She also exhibits at fairs, conventions and solo shows in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. A series of superhero plush toys she recently exhibited in Japan sold for $230 each.\"It's just me doing everything and I can't produce fast enough, which means I have to sell at a high price, which people may not be ready to pay,\" she admits.Finding time to craft and market her goods has become more challenging since the birth of her son, Olly.About half of her nine-hour work days are spent on administrative tasks: answering e-mail inquiries and updating her Etsy online store (www.etsy.com/sg-en/shop/CookieCutterEtsy), her Facebook page (www.facebook.com/thecookiecutter) and Instagram account (@cookiecutter).Despite her efforts, online sales have been erratic. Demand spikes during flea markets, trade fairs and exhibitions, where people can see her goods in person, she says.Her husband has supported her - both emotionally and financially. \"He encouraged me and kept me going even when I doubted myself,\" she says.\"Supporting myself on my craft would be tough. I'm still trying every day to make it work.\"But she cannot see herself going back to the corporate world.\"When you handmake something, you put a little bit of yourself into it,\" she says. \"I get a great sense of satisfaction when I see the final product. I also enjoy the process. When I am sewing, doodling or designing, I forget about everything around me.\"Lydia VaskoDDDOTSThe sight of a cast-iron book press left out overnight in the rain pained Ms Adelene Koh so much, she rushed to cart the 30kg press home.It belonged to a vintage shop at her condominium complex and she returned the following day and offered to buy it.\"The owner thought someone had stolen it, but I did not want it to rust and spoil,\" says Ms Koh, 31, who paid $200 for the press.The salvaged press flattens paper and is among Ms Koh's arsenal of bookbinding equipment such as laying presses, which hold pages together while the spine of the book is being worked on, and a plough, which trims the book's edges.Her equipment, which costs about $4,000, goes towards her craft business, dddots, which she started in 2011. She also invested about $20,000 on training classes in London and Tokyo.Ms Koh, who graduated from Lasalle College of the Arts with a diploma in communication design in 2006, spent three years in advertising as a graphic designer before joining Singapore Airlines as its cabin crew.On a holiday to New York City, she visited a bookfair in Brooklyn, where she discovered the possibilities of bookbinding. She later left the airline to focus on her business.Books are now \"produced en masse\", says Ms Koh, unlike older versions, with cut paper lovingly sewn into book covers by hand.\"I like to do things by hand and see what I can produce,\" she says.Much of her work involves refashioning books that have sentimental value to customers and friends, she says.For example, she has rebound a 1935 sixthedition version of Winnie The Pooh and a Bible, and produced a handmade book for a German couple, filled with WhatsApp messages from their courting days.But her most significant bookbinding project was a gift made from the wedding dress of her best friend. The long dress was to be transformed into a shorter cocktail outfit, so Ms Koh took the cut fabric and used it to form a book cover.\"Instead of clothes sitting there as just clothes, they get a new life,\" she explains.Ms Koh gets about two projects a month and spends about 11/2 months on a book. Her fee varies depending on the size and complexity of each book. For example, an A5 leather journal with 80 pages will cost about $100 to $180, depending on paper stock, quality of leather and finishing.While consignments to local shops might help business - she currently uses just her website, www.dddots.com, and Facebook to advertise her services - she says it might not be feasible for handmade work such as books.Consignments would require her to supply at least 20 pieces, which take at least a month's work, and not all pieces may be sold. Shops also take a sizeable cut of sales.But Ms Koh is sticking to her guns, crafting books lovingly, even if it costs her time and money. The bookbinder, who is single, supports herself with her savings and the takings from the business.She says: \"The most common question I get about bookbinding is: can you make money?\"My answer is 'no'. But I am happy and I think I earn more happiness than money.\"Kezia TohMANDY T SKINCAREThe plight of a friend with extremely sensitive skin - rashes erupt when she touches anything synthetic - struck a chord six years ago with Ms Mandy Leena Tan.\"If she sits while wearing shorts, she gets rashes on the backs of her thighs,\" explains Ms Tan, who is single and in her late 30s.However, the friend still wanted to pamper herself with grooming lotions and scrubs. So she became Ms Tan's \"best guinea pig\".Ms Tan chops and blends skincare products in her kitchen at home, using raw organic ingredients suitable for sensitive skin.She uses sugar - rather than the more conventional salt - in a homemade scrub she made for her friend, as it melts on contact with warm skin and exfoliates more gently. Happily, her friend was able to use the product without any adverse reactions.The desire to go all-natural in terms of skincare products has intensified for Ms Tan over the years, as she realises her expensive store-bought lotions and cleansers are not as organic as they claim to be.\"Many skincare products claim to be natural but use synthetic dyes, parabens or petrochemicals, or are tested on animals,\" she says. \"I could not even pronounce some of the ingredients on the list. More (ingredients) does not mean it is better.\"Thus, six years ago, she turned her kitchen in her three-bedroom house in Sydney - where she was based then, while working in public relations - into a \"big beauty laboratory\". In it, she experimented with ingredients such as mint, olive oil, lemon, green tea and brown rice - which have distinctive scents or textures and have various benefits for the skin - to create body scrubs, salt, soaps and lotions. She stores the products in her fridge: made of unprocessed ingredients, they have a shorter shelf life than over-the-counter ones. Her scrubs and salts last a year, while the lotions last two years.In 2008, she returned to Singapore. And in 2012, she quit her public relations job to focus on her beauty craft, before launching her Mandy T Skincare line last June.To prepare for the launch, she spent a year travelling to countries such as the United States, Australia, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.There, she scoured trade shows and factories to find suppliers of raw ingredients for her beauty products. She also acquired the technical know-how to formulate beauty products without formal training.As a final touch, she designed the website and packaging for her products. Mandy T's 28 varieties are available online from www.mandytskincare.com, as well as from shops such as Tyrwhitt General Company on Tyrwhitt Road. Prices are between $39 for bath salts and $59 for body creams.Each batch of about 50 items takes two hours on average to produce. Customers do not have to refrigerate the products, but are advised to keep them at room temperature under 30 deg C and out of direct sunlight.Her holidays abroad have since become opportunities to explore new ingredients for her wares. Recent shopping hauls include a mango plant from Australia and a luggage full of raw tea leaves from Sri Lanka.She has also consigned her favourite beverage, Arabic coffee, to the beauty drawing board, combining it with coconut as a body scrub.But each ingredient comes with limitations. Coffee beans, for example, have a rough and coarse texture and do not make smooth lotions.Turning a hobby into a viable business has been a \"dream come true\", says Ms Tan, who declines to reveal sales figures but says she broke even in three months, starting with a \"low five-figure sum\".\"When I make my products, my mindset is that I am creating it for myself - just on a slightly larger scale,\" she says.\"I am a bit of a craft cavewoman: I love making and using handmade things such as pottery, and now beauty products.\"Kezia TohA DOSE OF SOMETHING GOODLooking for a scented candle for his wife a few years ago, freelance creative advertising director Robert Upton went home from stores here empty-handed.Tired of not finding any with a fragrance that was special, Mr Upton, 42, decided he would make his own - despite not knowing how to. It was the birth of A Dose Of Something Good, his 18-month-old candle business.The Australian-born, Singapore permanent resident studied perfumery online and read books on how to make scents. The first candle he made, a rose-scented one, received the stamp of approval from his wife, Ms Goh Ling Ling, 39, bag designer and owner of home-grown label Ling Wu. They have three children - two girls and a boy - aged between three and 10 years old.He also drew good reviews from friends and family whom he made candles for. He tinkered with scents and wax for initial prototypes for about two years before he was ready to sell them.Today, he has four ready-to-sell scents: Rose Your Bottega, a sweet scented candle made with a combination of roses and lychee; Orange Flower Tattoo, a mix of jasmine and orange flowers; the more masculine scented The Violent Woods, made with violet leaf, cedarwood and oakmoss; and Verbena Round The World, made with verbena, lemon and vanilla. He will launch two new ones in September.He buys a high-quality paraffin-vegetable blend wax from Canada - he orders 10 27kg blocks at one go, which he keeps in a storage facility - lead-free wicks from Germany and hand-cast porcelain containers from China.After \"sketching\" the scent he wants by mixing essential oils, he works with a local perfumery to get the right scent and to produce it in larger batches. He bought a machine from America which can melt 22kg of wax at one go.Mr Upton, a graduate of Swinburne School of Design in Melbourne, put in about $10,000 of his savings to fund the start-up.He sells the $68 candles on www.dose.sg and other online platforms such as Haystakt, a marketplace for independent sellers. They are also available in stores such as menswear shop Benjamin Barker and furniture label Grafunkt in Park Mall. He takes orders for about 10 to 20 candles every week.While he still has a day job - he now works on a project basis at an international advertising agency with a Singapore office, Mr Upton turns his open-concept kitchen in his 1,600 sq ft condominium unit into an assembly line a few nights a week to handpour the candles. He makes about 50 a week and takes about three hours each night.His big break came last Christmas when Robinsons Orchard commissioned him to produce 600 candles for its cardmembers. He created lemongrass and ginger, and gardenia and citrus candles specially for the store.The highlight of the project: His logo shared the space on the porcelain cup with the Robinsons Orchard one. The words A Dose Of Something Good encased in a circle make up his brand's symbol.\"I didn't think my logo would be on it,\" he says. \"But for a big company to be supportive of a small, local business like mine... that's really encouraging that it's not just the well-known names which can collaborate with them. It's good marketing for me too.\"For now, home doubles as a workspace for the business, he says, as \"rent for a place outside is just too expensive\". It is also part of the reason he is not looking at opening a brick-and-mortar store just yet.He adds: \"There are still bills to pay and I have kids to feed. The candles aren't making me that kind of money to allow me to quit my job. There are also more considerations like finding the right location and being able to produce enough candles to meet demand. Right now, it's quite manageable and I see it more of something that I do in my free time, and it's quite enjoyable.\"I don't want the move to a brick-and-mortar store to be premature. I could end up hating the candle-making business if I don't plan it right.\"Natasha Ann ZachariahCARRIE K.One ring convinced Carolyn Kan that she had found her calling.The burnt-out advertising executive had quit her job at M&C Saatchi in 2008, leaving a 12-year career to embark on a year-long sabbatical. She travelled through Britain, France and Italy, where she began a month-long apprenticeship at a silversmith's shop in Florence.As her sabbatical wound towards its end, she faced the decision on what to do with her life.The answer came to her in July 2009. Rain was falling outside the silversmith's shop while she was inside, meticulously polishing the first silver ring she made.\"Suddenly, the sun shone through the window, lit up my ring and I just knew,\" recalls Ms Kan, 42.\"I realised I wanted to spend the rest of my life as a silversmith. It was a real epiphany, like something out of a Hollywood movie.\"She returned to Singapore and enrolled in a two-year silversmithing programme at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa). A year later, in 2010, her jewellery label Carrie K. won Elle Magazine's award for Jewellery Designer of the Year.Four years on, she now has a 80 sq m studio and showroom in Bukit Timah Road - a far cry from the early days of crafting on the kitchen table in her East Coast flat.Her designs are sold in nine stores here, such as Strangelets in Yong Siak Street and Front Row in the Raffles Hotel Arcade; in eight countries, spanning Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Italy, the United States and China; and online on her website (www.carriekrocks.com).Last year, she sold almost 2,000 pieces worldwide.She designs and makes the prototypes for four collections a year herself. Demand is so high for her pieces that, since 2011, she has been flying to Turkey, Italy and Thailand four or five times a year to teach artisans how to make her designs by hand to cope with the orders she receives.Her designs reveal her cheeky sense of humour: These include a diamond-encrusted safety pin ring ($2,230) and diamond safety pin earrings ($3,960) from her Reborn collection.\"I like my jewellery to challenge traditional ideas of what is desirable by finding beauty in everyday objects, like a paper clip or a safety pin, which people normally overlook,\" she says. \"I want to encourage society to look a little deeper, inspire them to think playfully about beauty.\"She will also launch a wedding collection, to be made in Singapore and Hong Kong, later this year.It takes five days to nine months for the designer to create a piece of jewellery. Her creations are priced from $100 for a single paperclip earring to $600 for a razor bracelet. Bespoke fine jewellery items, which she comes up with according to a client's preferences, start at $2,500 and can cost upwards of $45,000, for, say, a two-carat diamond engagement ring.Still, she favours silver for her jewellery, because its patina and colour changes with the wearer and time.\"I want to bring people back to making and using things which will last and grow,\" she says. \"I receive instant gratification when I see people's positive reactions to my work and know it is something they will keep and pass down in their family.\"Her husband, photographer Chiew Huan Chong, 48, also enrolled in Nafa's silversmith progr"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It said this in response to a query from the Singapore Exchange (SGX) on its evaluation of the offer.SingLand's second-largest shareholder Silchester International Investors, which had held 8.16 per cent of SingLand shares, said last Monday that UIC's offer was too low.The SGX asked last Friday whether ANZ had taken into account the fact that the offer price was 33.1 per cent lower than SingLand's net tangible assets (NTA) per share of $14.04.That figure includes the fair market value of SingLand's stake in three hotels - The Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore, The Marina Mandarin Singapore and Mandarin Oriental Singapore.ANZ replied that the 33.1 per discount to NTA was within the range of SingLand's peer group.It added that performing an NTA comparison with Sing- Land's peer group was sufficient and it did not need to also do a comparison based on revalued net asset value (RNAV).This is because a high proportion of SingLand's properties was factored in at fair market value in its report, it said.However, it went on to do a RNAV comparison anyway and noted that UIC's offer price was 31 per cent lower than SingLand's RNAV of $13.72 per share.

The fuel must be for their own use and cannot be sold to the public.But The Straits Times had no trouble filling up at two white pumps - a furniture factory in Sungei Kadut and a bottled gas supplier in Woodlands.The former required buyers to dial a number posted at the pump. A few minutes later, an attendant appeared, who even wrote a receipt for the diesel, which retailed at $1.19 a litre.The latter, despite prominent signs warning that the public was not allowed to buy diesel at its site, had pump attendants on hand who were selling the fuel at $1.45 a litre.In Tuas, a company called Sysma Energy openly advertises its product. Customers must apply for a chip-embedded tag to operate its pumps. Details of fuel dispensed, time and date are captured by Sysma's system, and customers are billed later. Sysma admitted that its diesel does not contain detergent and anti-foaming additives, which diesel sold at authorised pumps contains.Caltex and Shell refused to comment on the white pump operators while ExxonMobil said it supplies fuel to a wide range of customers, including transport companies and industrial users.\"Due to anti-trust considerations, we are not in a position to monitor what they then do with the fuel,\" its spokesman said.The Ministry of Trade and Industry said the fuel market \"is open to competition\", but retailers are governed by the competition law, as well as \"various regulations\", such as those pertaining to safety.The National Environment Agency said it \"conducts surprise checks\" on fuel retailers. In one recent check on three operators, the agency said their diesel met its stipulated cap on sulphur content and they bought their fuel from oil companies here.The Consumers Association of Singapore said it supports competition in the fuel market as long as it is legal.\"We support anything that encourages competition,\" Case executive director Seah Seng Choon said. \"Of course, we're talking about pumps that are properly managed to ensure fuel quality, safety and that the meters are properly calibrated.\"Not all consumers are taken in by lower prices at white pumps.Contractor Andy Goh, 45, said: \"Even though some of them advertise that their diesel complies with Euro 5 (an emission standard), I don't feel safe. Their fuel quality is very different.\"Cabby Victor Yow, 68, said: \"There's no point, because Comfort (taxi operator ComfortDelGro) sells diesel at lower prices.\"christan@sph.com.sgJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Overseas Union Enterprise (OUE)Broker: OCBCOUE reported Q1 net profit of $945.6 million, which is up more than 100 per cent year-on-year due to fair value gains from Lippo Plaza ($114.8 million) and Mandarin Orchard Singapore and Mandarin Gallery ($986.4 million), offset by an allowance for foreseeable loss of $105 million from Twin Peaks.Adjusting for the impact of these one-time items, we estimate core Q1 net profit at $6.5 million which is broadly within expectations.In terms of the topline, 1Q14 revenues increased 1.5 per cent to $106.9 million; this was mainly due to new contributions of the Lippo Plaza property and the US Bank tower, offset by a $9.1 million dip in property development income.Maintain Buy. Our fair value estimate is adjusted to $2.87, from $3.32 previously, after incorporating into our model the new structure of the group after its listing of OUE Commercial Reit.3. Wilmar InternationalBroker: CIMBAt its Q1 results briefing, Wilmar revealed that soybean crush margins have improved but remain in negative territory. It is more optimistic on its refining margin prospects in Q2 due to improved palm oil supplies.The group also guided for higher palm oil production driven by better yields, but sugar milling operations may be impacted by lower sugar prices. Overall, we expect Q2's earnings to improve quarter-on-quarter.We maintain our target price of $3.47 and Hold rating. The stock remains cheap but this is offset by the challenging operating conditions faced in some key divisions.The stock lacks short-term catalysts due to the challenging conditions the company faces in some of its markets. But we see limited downside from the current price level as it is trading close to its book value, and we remain positive on the long-term prospects of the group."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

ComfortDelGroBroker: OSK-DMGComfortDelGro's Q1 net profit rose 9.7 per cent year-on-year to $63.3 million on $950.8 million in revenue.Its British business continues to shine, which saw its revenue and earnings before interest and tax jump 51.7 per cent to $222.2 million and 90.3 per cent to $19.6 million respectively. This was largely on the contribution from Metroline West along with synergies achieved in cost savings.Notably, management guided that the Government was likely to announce favourable changes in the upcoming Parliament meeting on May 16. The changes would likely be linked to bus operations rather than for the rail refinancing framework.As such, we continue to prefer ComfortDelGro over SMRT Corp, given the former's large exposure to the bus business. Maintain Buy with a higher target price of $2.48, from $2.22 previously.2. Dyna-Mac HoldingsBroker: OCBCDyna-Mac reported a strong 31.3 per cent year-on-year surge in its Q1 revenue to $78.9 million, and this made up 29.3 per cent of our FY2014 forecast.However, net profit grew by a smaller magnitude of 6.5 per cent to $7.1 million, in line with our expectations (23.7 per cent of our full-year estimate). This was due largely to a weaker gross margin and a 43.3 per cent jump in administrative expenses to $8.3 million. Hence, net profit margin came in at 9.1 per cent, versus 11.2 per cent in Q1 last year.Dyna-Mac also announced that it has secured new fabrication orders for two repeat customers worth a provisional sum of $50 million. Fabrication of these orders is expected to commence in Q2. Including this latest contract win, Dyna-Mac's net order book now stands at $342 million. The group continues to receive active tender enquires from both its long-term and new clients.Maintain Buy and $0.47 fair value estimate on Dyna-Mac.3. Frasers Centrepoint (FCL)Broker: CIMBFCL has announced its acquisition of Sofitel Sydney Wentworth and proposed the listing of a hospitality trust, Frasers Hospitality Trust (FHT). FHT will own an initial 12 assets: six serviced apartments from FCL plus six hotels from parent company TCC.We see this move as a strategic one, to consolidate FCL's and TCC's hospitality assets and increase rooms under management. With TCC's over 40 hotels, FHT can be the biggest hospitality Reit in the future. This should not only give FCL a ready platform for future divestments but enlarge its asset-management business.FCL remains attractive for its valuations and strong fundamentals. We expect its FHT listing to speed up its capital recycling and boost its rooms under management.We maintain our Add rating with a higher target price of $2.07 (from $2.06 previously) after raising our forecasts."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

It refers to shared spaces, often furnished with things such as specialised tools and equipment, that people can use for a fee to design and create objects.It adds to at least two other maker spaces here: Social enterprise Sustainable Living Lab, which opened in Yishun in 2011, and Mettle Work, which opened in Geylang last October.Besides providing infrastructure, they are also where hobbyists gather to exchange ideas. The concept stems from the maker movement in the US, which encourages the do-it-yourself, or DIY, culture and innovation.More people here are becoming interested in making their own things, said Mr William Hooi, 41, an event and creative consultant who organises \"maker gatherings\". About 300 people showed up for a meet-up two months ago, up from about 20 at the first one in January last year.\"We usually invite speakers - from scientists, to designers and educators - to talk about projects which show inventiveness and resourcefulness. After that, people tend to stay late to talk, discuss and 'geek out',\" he said.At the Home-Fix maker space, a day pass costs $20, while a monthly one costs $120.It can accommodate only about 12 people now, but is being expanded to fit 40 to 50 people.Since its soft launch two weeks ago, about eight people, including German carpenter Till Oliver Kautz, 30, have signed up.Mr Kautz, who has a monthly pass, has been visiting the centre's wood workshop almost daily for the past two weeks to build a coffee table for the apartment where he lives with his girlfriend.\"I have no space at home for this kind of work. It gets too dusty and there is a smell. This place is good as it is very big and there are good tools,\" he said.Other projects that users are working on include the building of speakers and 3D printers.Home-Fix managing director Low Cheong Kee decided to set up this $500,000 space last year when he heard about the maker movement. \"Most of the population lives in HDB flats and we do not have garages to tinker with things,\" he said. \"So we decided to convert some of the underutilised space in our industrial building into the maker space.\"At Sustainable Living Lab, students and people keen to try hands-on projects do not pay. Instead, the social enterprise supports itself via a start-up grant from Spring Singapore and activities such as paid classes and corporate team-building events.Said co-founder Veerappan Swaminathan: \"In exchange for using our space, people help us out and also contribute to the community via their projects.\"Mettle Work is a 12,000 sq ft co-working space geared towards professionals, from designers to architects. It cost between $150,000 and $180,000 to set up and is fitted with equipment such as power tools, drills, saws and a welding machine. People pay between $399 and $900 a month to use it.

This comprises higher showflat costs for its recent project launches, such as Seventy Saint Patrick's in Marine Parade.Group chief executive Gwee Lian Kheng said: \"With the tepid global economic outlook and subdued residential market in Singapore, we will continue to be selective in residential land acquisitions and focus more effort on commercial and hospitality properties with recurring income.\"Our maiden investment in London will act as a springboard for us to expand our hotel management business in Europe.\"Earnings per share for the quarter came in at 13.23 cents, up from the 12.14 cents in the same period last year, while net asset value per share climbed to $9.29 as at Sept 30, an increase over the $8.77 as at Dec 31."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

His is not easy philanthropy but the hard road. Though it is arguably easy for him to write a cheque, his charity preaches the gospel of self-reliance. It wants to help the poor become self-sufficient rather than rely on handouts.He is candid in saying that until a decade ago, he was preoccupied with making his own living. His turning point came after the Indian Ocean tsunami of Dec 26, 2004, when he accompanied his freelance photographer wife Kheng Ju to Veerasamy Road on her photo project.She was shooting Indian and Sri Lankan migrant workers whose families had been wiped out by the killer waves. They were anxious to go home to bury their dead but were stuck here as they still owed money to their agents.Her portraits of these desperate men were featured in an exhibition and sold, and the proceeds donated to relief efforts. It set him wondering about the many others who had fallen through the cracks.The next December, the couple wended their way to Mae Sot in western Thailand. They visited the Mae Tao Clinic, which treats and fits Myanmar landmine victims with prosthetic limbs. There, he experienced a \"hit in the gut\".By 2006, he had set up non-profit Asia Refuge Projects and embarked on his first project - funding a school extension shed for Myanmar refugees in Mae Sot for $3,500.Over the next seven years, he spent seven days every December visiting social projects in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.Back in Singapore, he followed up with the NGOs through e-mail, vetting their operations, scrutinising their proposals during nights and weekends. \"You meet 30 organisations on a trip and you're lucky if you get one or two with the right fit. You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince. In a way, it is similar to investing,\" he says, exemplifying his legendary fastidiousness. \"I was interested in effectiveness, something that, in corporate finance, has been drummed into me.\"Over the next seven years, applying the same rigour, he sank about $50,000 into five projects, including computer training, education, water access and malaria prevention across Indochina. They were all \"decent, effective projects\", yet something gnawed at him.Hooked on handoutsIn 2009, he donated $14,000 to build 120 wells for drought-afflicted villagers in Battambang, Cambodia. A year later, he returned to find some wells disused because their hinges were broken. It was a simple repair job but the locals said: \"Oh, we are waiting for the NGO to come back and repair it.\"It dawned on him: \"What we were addressing were the symptoms of poverty and not the underlying cause.\"The way forward, he resolved, was to tackle both the psychological and technical aspects of poverty.First, to restore the self-belief of the chronic poor. \"After struggling for generations, many have lost their confidence to plan for the next harvest. We need to see their potential and help them lift themselves up.\"Beyond self-belief, poor farmers most urgently need access to small loans, quality seeds and skills training to improve their yields.Since last year, he has partnered promising social enterprises which address these technical causes of poverty. One of them is iDE Cambodia, which sells farmers high-quality, low-cost agricultural inputs, bundled with technical advice. So far, he has given grants, advice and even hired a consultant to help iDE streamline its processes, to the tune of $18,000.He wants to improve the odds of survival for such social enterprises with a market focus. Out of 100 social enterprises, he notes, on average, only one will break even, attract impact investors and scale up.\"The other 99 run out of capital and end in the Valley of Death. We want to identify the more promising three to five of these social enterprises, assist them with grants and advice to provide the bridge to impact investors.\"He has since renamed his non-profit Leap201 to reflect its new mission of empowering the poor to earn above US$2 a day. He has also formed a board and professionalised operations by hiring two staff. He is now looking for more volunteers, especially strategy consultants and private equity investors, to help advise promising social enterprises, as well as creative directors in advertising to help spread the word.Next month, Leap201 will hold a one-day forum called Bridges To Impact to brainstorm ideas to help social enterprises and NGOs in South-east Asia scale up.Former colleague Patrick Lee, 42, who worked with him at Morgan Stanley and is now head of corporate and institutional clients at Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore), notes that Mr Lien applies the same tenacity to charity as he did to investment banking.\"Colleagues and friends would gasp at his very demanding and perfectionist leadership style, but on reflection, thank him for all the learning they gained from him. Exasperating but brilliant to work with.\"Living with dualityIf you haven't heard of Michael Lien, it is because he, like many of the Lien family, keep an assiduously low profile.He was the third child of the second son of the late Lien Ying Chow, a penniless orphan who migrated here from China at age 13 and started his own successful trading company, Wah Hin & Co, in 1929. He also founded Overseas Union Bank, Singapore's fourth largest bank until it was acquired by United Overseas Bank in 2001. He died in 2004.The watershed in Michael Lien's life happened when he was 11 and his father, retired commercial banker Lien Chin Wah, divorced his housewife mother and remarried. His mother - \"brave in a quiet way and selfless\" - raised him and his two elder siblings with her savings and some help from their grandfather.All he remembers is that he used to enjoy an orange - his favourite fruit - after school every day but was told one day that he had to share it. At 13, in a show of loyalty to his mother, he and his siblings, who were all born in Britain while their father was a student, decided to emigrate there with her \"for a fresh start\". But their grandfather persuaded them to stay.They lived here in a rented apartment on Holland Road, never feeling quite Lien enough, since their mother was a \"non-Lien\". \"We felt we were on our own in a way,\" he recounts.At Catholic High School and then National Junior College, he remembers he had exactly enough money for lunch every day. \"It would be embarrassing if I over-ordered,\" he recalls.He won a Colombo Plan scholarship to Monash University in Melbourne to study finance and econometrics. While there, he read to the blind in the library and worked at a Russian-owned nuts and bolts factory alongside scruffy, hardworking Eastern Europeans during holidays. He returned to serve two years at Ministry of Trade and Industry, but left for a \"faster environment\" after two years. Then, he began his corporate financier career with Standard Chartered Bank in 1990. In 1994, he joined Morgan Stanley, became its Singapore head of corporate finance in 1999 and managing director in 2001. Those years, he says, \"bought me financial independence\".After OUB was sold to UOB for US$5.7 billion in 2001, he began helping to manage investments for the Lien family \"during weekends and downtime\". A year later, at 39, he left the corporate world, resigning from Morgan Stanley after helping it snare more than half of a record US$39.4 billion in Singapore takeovers in 2001.He returned to the Lien fold for good, and for the past 13 years has been investing their assets as executive director and chairman of Wah Hin. \"I don't think the others want the job. I got arrowed. But I'm happy to be doing this because I see it as part of my duty... As custodian for the capital, I'm very mindful that half of the resources support Lien Foundation's programmes. So it's a serious responsibility,\" says the erudite man, who is a board director of Temasek Holdings and a member of the National University of Singapore's board of trustees.He says he didn't consider hitching his anti-poverty agenda with the Lien Foundation bandwagon, which is chaired by his cousin and former Nominated MP Laurence Lien, as he says the latter focuses quite specifically on education, eldercare and the environment. \"Income generation isn't one of their focuses.\"Perhaps it is uniquely his. At Wah Hin and Leap201, he juggles the dichotomy of amassing riches by day and reducing poverty by night.His former JC classmate, Mr Olivier Lim, 50, until recently deputy CEO of property group CapitaLand, says Mr Lien was always a \"considered contrarian, not willing to accept status quo and conventional wisdom blindly, but also not contrarian for the sake of it\". \"Among my friends, he was the most well-read. He drove the cheapest and oldest car for years, not succumbing to the automobile arms race. He preferred to save his money travelling to places like rural Nepal. Yet, at the same time, he led a 'double life' as a successful investment banker.\"Today, with a six-year-old son, Mr Lien no longer drives a \"bombed-out car\". But he still enjoys the simple things in life, like a prata and teh tarik. He continues to \"like to move off the grid\", trekking the Inca Trail in Peru or the Simien Mountains in Ethiopia. \"In these remote places, you are grateful for a bowl of hot vegetable soup,\" he says, tight-lipped about other aspects of how he lives.As to why he juggles this \"duality\", the free-thinker says simply: \"It could have been us.\"He recalls a riverside lunch in a Laotian villager's home on Don Khong Island. He had asked his usual \"What do you need, how can we help you?\" His host family, who had cooked for him, answered: \"Our children are sick and we don't know why.\"The answer, staring them in the face, was the Mekong River which ran through the village. The water was inky with manufacturing waste, refuse and sewage. It was glinting at them.\"We knew that the children were getting sick because the water was dirty. But, of course, they cooked the rice with water from the river and we ate it.\"Had we been born in Cambodia, Myanmar or Laos, this would have been our world. It could have been anyone. It could have been us.\"suelong@sph.com.sgJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Student Tan Yong Da has made peace with being called a hipster after years of struggling with the label.The 23-year-old Singapore Institute of Management undergraduate is often in skinny jeans and T-shirts featuring bands that few have heard of, collects vinyl records - he has more than 100 - and takes photos with film.From time to time, he throws small parties for friends in remote public spaces such as a quarry, playing all kinds of music from punk and electronic to shoegaze and noise from a boom box.His sense of fashion and personal interests, which began taking shape in his late teens, have prompted friends to brand him a hipster. Although it irks him, he has \"tried to stop running away\" from the label. His self-denial, distress and eventual acquiescence in the face of hipsterism mirror what has been building in Singapore's social and cultural fronts in recent years, which some say has likely reached a tipping point.The term hipster, a sweeping description of what is at the forefront of style, fashion and taste and is used on both people and things, has been a double-edged sword.On the one hand, the label has made it easy to put a finger on anything trendsetting, be it music, apparel or a lifestyle offering, and turn it into something that can be bought and sold.This has spurred the growth of businesses here, from artisanal cafes to bespoke clothiers, and transformed the neighbourhoods they are in.Trendy boutiques and eateries that moved into Tiong Bahru in recent years, for example, have turned the once-sleepy housing estate into a sprawling shopping enclave. The stores, touting heritage as novelty, draw the cool and curious on weekends. Hungry for everything homemade and hand-crafted, they squish into 1.5m-wide walkways and coffee shops built for a time when the population was a fifth of what it is now.As this potent mix of commerce, lifestyle and tastes became couched as \"hipster\", however, the word quickly became anathema. The have-nots and know-nots excuse their exclusion and ignorance by employing gentle mockery. The other camp, ill at ease about their privileged, too-cool-for-school status, take offence and deny their hipster status.These vague feelings of hurt and envy, however, go beyond a class struggle fought on taste.Its earliest use, in the 1940s in the United States, was to describe enthusiasts of the nascent jazz style, bebop, which rebelled against the prevailing genre, swing, with its quick tempo and asymmetrical phrasing.Those who bought into the subversiveness of bebop, and the life and style of its musicians, dressed and behaved in defining ways. A hipster would not greet by raising his arm, he extended his index finger; he wore peg trousers and padded shoulders with a presence of their own.When the label came back into circulation in the early 2000s in the US, a hipster continued to have \"an air of knowing about exclusive things before anyone else\", says author Mark Greif in the 2010 New York Magazine article, What Was The Hipster?.But this knowledge was no longer creative; it mostly borrowed from the forgotten past and thrived on anachronistic mash-ups.Drainpipe jeans of the 1950s were reincarnated as skinny jeans and paired with lumberjack flannel shirts. Heavy-rimmed glasses shed their lenses and Civil War-era beards invaded men's faces.Taxidermied animals and terrariums, once fixtures of homes in the 19th century, reappeared in the design of interiors. Fixed-gear bicycles and vinyl records that had earlier fallen out of favour cycled back into currency.Eateries and bars took a leaf out of the book of speakeasies of the 1920s with secret, password-protected entrances. Food, drinks and clothing made the old-fashioned way by hand instead of machine overthrew efficiency and productivity.Many of these trends later found their way here, from lumberjack fashion in the concrete jungle of Singapore to the rash of farmers' markets that have sprung up.It did not take long for clones of hipsters from New York City's Williamsburg and Seattle's Capitol Hill neighbourhoods to be spotted in London's Shoreditch, Sydney's Redfern and Singapore's Tiong Bahru and Haji Lane.In Singapore, the hipster wave is driven by a young generation \"seeking and consuming authenticity in a rapidly changing urban environment\", says Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun of Nanyang Technological University's Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information.\"Compared with contrived megamalls and mass-manufactured consumer items in chain stores, icons from the past can come across as more authentic,\" he adds. \"For digital natives and the Starbucks generation, the analogue vinyl or rustic kopitiam would seem to be more 'real'.\"Around 2010, cafes serving hand-crafted coffee began opening in old shophouses here; bespoke fashion boutiques were launched; shops selling vintage furniture and knick-knacks sprang up.These stores, often in old neighbourhoods such as Jalan Besar and Haji Lane, were typically filled with the halogen glow of vintage light bulbs, the warmth of recycled wood furnishings and a set of young, trendy customers seeking a singular experience.Had these disparate developments happened at a time when \"hipster\" was not already trending around the world, they might not have come under the same banner.But being birthed at a time of books and TV shows parodying hipsterism - The Hipster Handbook, a tongue-in-cheek guide to the wave in Brooklyn, New York, was published in 2003; the hit TV series Portlandia, a satire on neo-bohemian types in Portland, Oregon, aired in 2011 - their fate was cast. They would be viewed through the hipster lens and unwittingly subsumed in a wave sometimes seen to be bingeing on cool.Voicing this conundrum is Ms Cynthia Chua, 43, founder of the Spa Esprit Group which includes businesses such as the cafe 40 Hands Coffee, serving artisanal coffee alongside old-school local treats such as tau sar pau (steamed red bean bun), and the men's grooming salon We Need A Hero, both in Tiong Bahru.She says, nonchalant: \"Anything that is new, cool and attracts a certain group of people, influencers who are active on social media, becomes labelled as hipster. But the concepts we create are about identifying a gap in the market and coming up with something that is relevant to the local palate and what people want.\"Indeed, few, if any, of the businesses commonly associated with the wave had any intention of being hipster, hence their owners' unease about being lumped with the social phenomena.Mr Leon Foo, 32, owner of the cafe Chye Seng Huat Hardware in Jalan Besar, says he has had to \"deal with\" the label since the cafe opened in 2012 selling hand-crafted coffee in an industrial-looking space that channels the spirit of its former occupant, a hardware store.\"We are part of the hipster wave because coffee is a subculture which hipsters like, but we didn't do it intentionally to be hipster. What we believe in is showcasing coffee in a different way,\" he adds.It is the same for people who buy into these commodities and find themselves slapped with the label that carries shades of both tastemaker and trend leech.Mr Darren Lee, 34, founder of street-style website Shentonista and director of creative consultancy Uniform, says in half-jest: \"Now, it's almost dangerous to be cool or informed or to have cultural cachet because you are immediately labelled a hipster.\"It is not easy, however, to brush aside the perniciousness of the wave, especially in the dining scene.For one, colonies of similar-looking cafes, bars and restaurants have saturated the landscape.Ms Cherin Tan, 30, creative director of interior design firm LAANK, says it has received requests from clients who want their set-ups to look like a certain hipster cafe \"because it is a look that has proven to work and is popular for now\".\"But we try to steer them away from that because it is a trend that is not going to stick around for long,\" she says.It has also crippled some business-customer relationships.Mr Foo of Chye Seng Huat Hardware laments the loss of customers \"who love our coffee but felt out of place\" in a cafe associated with a trend, even as it gained new fans. \"Nobody should care. They should just come for the coffee.\"But some good has also come out of the wave.Mr Lim of Uniform notes that it has spurred the growth of bespoke, craft-based menswear here such as shoemakers ed et al and menswear tailor Kevin Seah Bespoke.\"For these local craftsmen and makers, it has helped them sustain their business,\" he says.Ms Tan of LAANK says the strong aesthetic push of the wave has also made the public and clients pay more attention to design.The only way forward for hipsters of any kind, then, is with confidence.Mr Muhamad Jamuri Busori, 42, founder of the I Am cafe in Haji Lane, which ticks all the hipster checkboxes with an industrial look, mason jar mugs and staff who sometimes dress in the hipster theme, says: \"I didn't know what was 'hipster' until my staff told me about it this year.\"People may use the label on us but we know where we are headed. The cafe was inspired by my holiday to Amsterdam. My staff dress up to make the work environment more fun, and my target audience has always been working adults in the area.\"Similarly, Ms Ginette Chittick, 37, programme leader of Lasalle College of the Arts' diploma in fashion and a forerunner of the alternative music scene here, tells friends she is \"too old\" when they teasingly call her a hipster for her trailblazing taste in music and fashion.\"The ones who are using the term in a derogatory manner should lighten up. Hipster is a sign of the times, part of the zeitgeist of today; people should just let it be,\" she says.lijie@sph.com.sgAre you a hipster?Take our test to find out how much of a hipster you are.1.

It is now the second- largest currency for trade finance, the seventh-largest for overall payments, and the ninth most widely traded currency.The increasing currency links between Singapore and China have boosted the Republic's status as a global financial centre. They have also given local firms an edge in what is now the world's largest economy, and made conditions here more favourable for Chinese businesses looking to expand overseas.For example, yuan-clearing facilities in Singapore allow local firms doing business in China to transact directly in the Chinese unit more easily. This lets them avoid some exchange rate risk and China-regulated foreign exchange processes, and broadens their trading and investment opportunities in China.Singapore firms can now also repatriate surplus yuan from their China operations back to Singapore. As a regional financial centre, Singapore is well-positioned to seize the opportunities presented by yuan internationalisation to grow its financial sector - and its economic ties with China.The Republic has a competitive advantage in the offshore yuan space, given that it is a leading regional trade and commodities hub. It is also a nexus for multinationals, many of which want to expand in China.So it is not surprising that yuan deposits in Singapore at end-June had reached 254 billion yuan (S$54 billion) - an 84 per cent increase from June last year.The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) Singapore, the only authorised yuan clearing bank here, cleared 21 trillion yuan of transactions from January to August - more than eight times what it cleared from June to December last year.Its yuan foreign exchange turnover reached a daily average of nearly US$70 billion (S$90 billion) in June, almost quadrupling year on year.The total value of cross-border yuan settlement between Singapore and China stood at 515.2 billion yuan in the first half of this year, accounting for 10.7 per cent of the overall offshore market.One way Singapore can further its role in the yuan internationalisation story is to work with other offshore yuan centres, rather than compete head-on with them. This will allow Singapore, along with the other markets, to leverage on one another's strengths.Take ICBC's issuance in September of a record 4 billion yuan of \"Lion City\" bonds, or yuan-denominated bonds from Singapore. Two of the three tranches were dual-listed on the Singapore Exchange and Taiwan's GreTai Securities Market, in the first such tie-up between the two bourses.Taiwan shows rapid growth in yuan deposits, while Singapore has strengths in treasury and trade finance. Given their complementary roles, there is scope for them and other markets to collaborate in research, development and promotion of yuan products.Once the yuan becomes globally acceptable for investment, financing and payment purposes, it can go on to serve as a reserve, intervention and anchoring currency on an international scale.That will lead to the final stage: full convertibility of the yuan. Singapore companies, Chinese enterprises and regional regulators all have a part to play in this exciting journey.stopinion@sph.com.sgThe writer is general manager, ICBC, Singapore branch."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

In Singapore, it has acquired various businesses including Qualitas Medical Group and was part of a consortium that acquired Mentor Media in 2006. Once all the preconditions of the deal are met, Southern Capital will mount a general offer for the remainder of UE E&C shares.It intends to make UE E&C a wholly-owned subsidiary. This means Southern Capital will seek to delist and privatise the company should its offer crosses the 90 per cent threshold for compulsory acquisition.It will also mean a short existence for UE E&C as a listed company, given that it began trading on the mainboard in 2011.The UE E&C group provides integrated mechanical & electrical (M&E) engineering services that include high and low-voltage electrical power distribution, air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation, and fire protection, alarm and sanitary systems. It also provides a comprehensive range of services for its construction business, from design and build, civil works to general construction for residential, industrial, commercial and institutional buildings as well as infrastructural works. UE E&C is an active player in public housing through executive condominium projects, as well as private residential property development, through taking up minority stakes in joint ventures.

Another highest in the world figure.There has been much written about the increased spending power of Asian consumers, in addition to their penchant for fashion and brand names, many of which have launched or expanded in Asian markets over the last decade. Now there is evidence that not only are people in India and China more brand-conscious than their counterparts in Europe and the U.S. they also are quite open in their passion for brand names in the context of fashion. In fact, almost three-quarters of adults in China (72%) and in India (74%) admit that brand names are important to them when purchasing clothing and accessories, compared to just one-quarter in the U.S. (26%), Great Britain (24%), and even in the country known as the worlds fashion haven Italy (28%)! These are some of the results of The Harris Poll conducted online by Harris Interactive among 9,222 adults in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and India, the U.S and Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Trendy vs. ClassicThere are indications that in certain markets purchasing classics is more important than being trendy. 74% of Americans tend to purchase classics versus trends; a practice which is shared among adults in China (71%), India (70%), France (60%), the UK (58%), Germany and Italy (57% each). However, in China and India, 63% indicated that they like to be the first out of their friends to have the latest trend whereas a quarter or fewer in all the other countries agreed (9% to 24%). In most of the markets studied there is a strong belief that good brand names translate to quality products; 9 in 10 adults in India (89%) and China (92%) believe that brand names provide better value due to quality, a thought shared by majorities in Singapore (75%), the U.S. (65%), Italy (63%), and France (53%) as well. However, in Spain (41%), Great Britain (48%) and Germany (47%), fewer than half think this is the case. In Singapore (77%), India (72%), Great Britain (68%), the U.S. (66%), Spain (65%) Italy (64%) and Germany (63%) there is also a fondness for bargains, even if they are not brand names as long as it is trendy. In Singapore, where shopping is a national pastime, and on the heels of the Great Singapore Sale 41% reported the main reason for their last purchase as I was just browsing and it caught my eye.

Hot on the heels of CapitaLands announcement to erect a 575,000 sq ft mall on the parcel next to the Jurong East MRT station, Lend Lease unveiled its plan to develop Singapores third largest suburban mall, spanning 818,000 sq ft, on the site next door. In addition, the area is home to two major malls IMM (409,000 sq ft) and JCube (204,000 sq ft) owned by CapitaLands REIT entity.While suburban malls are getting bigger and glitzier, it is unprecedented to have not one, but three regional malls, a stones throw away from each other. The latest slew of supply will take the mall tally in the area to almost 1.6 million sq ft, dwarngHarbourFronts 1.2 million sq ft comprising VivoCity and HarbourFront Centre.Helmed by two seasoned retail developers, shoppers can expect a whole new retail experience. The sheer size of the respective malls pose an opportunity for unique positioning and trade mix that differ from those in city areas, where land is scarce and more expensive. For example, the malls could accommodate more big-format stores and lifestyle zones, such as the water skypark in VivoCity and the pet enclave at Nex mall.As it is, Lend Lease has unveiled that its Jurong mall, to be called Jem, will have the largest cineplex in the west with eight commercial halls and two platinum movie suites. Around 50% of the mall has been pre-let, mostly to six anchor tenants. Among them, Robinsons have committed to lease a sizeable 85,000 sq ft of space while FairPrice Xtra will operate a 70,000 sq ft hypermart.In the meantime, IMM, JCube and CapitaLands latest mall could be synergised and transformed into a multi-themed megacomplex. While JCube is already positioned as an entertainment zone, IMM could feature more big-format stores. The group plans to have mini-anchor tenants for its latest mall.In terms of potential catchment for the malls, it is said that Jurong Gateway, the newly coined name for the area around the Jurong East MRT station, will be two and a half times the size of Tampines Regional Centre.The latter is currently home to three major malls Century Square(200,000 sq ft), Tampines 1 (260,000 sq ft) and Tampines Mall (328,000 sq ft). Jurong Gateway is envisaged to be the biggest commercial hub outside the city with 5.4 million sq ft of ofce space, 2.7 million sq ft of retail, F&B and entertainment space, 2,800 hotel rooms, and at least 1,000 new homes.

UOL is trading at a 26% discount to RNAV of $6.20 and offers 16% upside to our TP of $5.27, pegged at a 15% discount to asset backing. Our RNAV values the quoted equity component based on our target prices. Using the latest traded prices, this figure would be even higher at $5.35.

The latter parcel will be launched in 2H11. Surrounding condos are transacting between $950-1,000psf and we believe it would be able to rake in decent margins of 10-15% at these levels.The landed component is receiving strong buying interest given its attractive surroundings. The Lion City site will be transformed into a residential/retail development when launched in 2012. Our RNAV has captured an ASP of $1200psf for this project. The group is relatively cautious on the physical market outlook and will adopt a selective landbanking strategy.

Added catalyst from UIC due to redevelopment of UIC Building. UOL will benefit from the redevelopment of UIC Building, through its 42.7% stake in UIC. The mixed residential/ commercial development is expected to start construction early next year and the residential portion to be launched in 1H12.

He said he has been renting the unit since 2010 and reached an agreement with the landlord to keep the rent from skyrocketing. He said his landlord turned down a $2 million offer recently to buy the shop.Mr Henry Ong, a real estate agent who has been handling commercial property transactions since 2007, told The Straits Times that rents have been rising in tandem with increasing resale values.\"Most HDB shops islandwide could be rented at $4,000 to $5,000 per month five years ago. Now for that amount you'd get only half a shop.\"That translates to as much as around $14 per sq ft a month for centrally located retail shops.Coffee shops cost slightly more. Chris International director Chris Koh estimates coffee shop rents are 20 per cent to 30 per cent higher compared with that of shops in the same area because coffee shops draw more customers.A standard two-storey HDB shophouse is 1,400 sq ft to 1,500 sq ft, so the shop on the first storey is usually 700 sq ft to 750 sq ft.Colliers International deputy managing director Grace Ng said asking prices for resale HDB shophouses have generally risen over the past few years by 30 per cent to 50 per cent.But while investor demand is increasing, there is a limited supply of HDB shops that can be resold, so prices are rising. Out of the 14,450 HDB shops islandwide as at March, 8,500 were sold by the HDB to private landlords under a Sale of Tenanted Shops programme that began in 1992 and was discontinued in 1998, the HDB told The Straits Times.Only these 8,500 shops can be resold on the private market. They tend to be found in older estates such as Toa Payoh, Yishun and Hougang.The other 5,950 are owned and leased out by the HDB. This number includes all the shops in newer towns such as Punggol, Sengkang and Sembawang. They are let by open tender on a fixed term tenancy of three years at market rates, the HDB said.The tenant mix differs between HDB-leased shops and privately owned ones, because private landlords subdivide their units and lease those separately to boost rental yield. As a result, tenants of privately owned HDB shops tend to be those that require less space, such as bakeries and convenience stores. HDB-leased shop tenants tend to be larger ones such as banks and restaurants, Ms Ng said.Unlike with other commercial properties, there is no publicly available information on resale transactions of HDB shops. Ms Ng reckons that shops in prized locations such as Clementi Town Centre can sell for $3.5 million to more than $10 million, depending on the size and position.melissat@sph.com.sgJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.Read 3 articles and stand to win rewardsSpin the wheel nowMCI (P) 066/10/2023.

Even the World Cup soccer competition could become a distraction for potential buyers in this tepid market, analysts say.\"It is premature to conclude that the market has revived from its slump,\" said Ong Teck Hui, national director of Research and Consultancy at JLL, pointing to the mixed showing at new launches last month.Latest data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed that developers sold 1,470 private condos last month, the highest level since June 2013 and a 96 per cent jump from the 749 units sold in April. The top five projects made up 78 per cent of total sales in May.The strong showing is driven by new launches, with 1,790 condo units launched last month compared with only 600 units in April. There were no new launches for executive condos (ECs) last month; 58 ECs were sold, up from 48 in April.\"The increase in the number of new projects launched in May and the strong launch figures do show that developers are more confident in resuming launches as there still many buyers in the market but who are now more price-sensitive,\" Mr Ong said.The two top sellers were Coco Palms and Commonwealth Towers - both located near MRT stations and deemed attractively priced. Together, they made up more than half the month's unit launches and sales. Some 590 units at Coco Palms were sold at a median price of $1,018 per square foot (psf), and 275 at Commonwealth Towers were sold at a median price of $1,626 psf.The Panorama in Ang Mo Kio became a top seller last month, with some 100 units sold at a median $1,241 psf after developer Wheelock Properties slashed prices by around 10 per cent in its re-launch last month. The project moved only 56 units in the initial launch in January at a median $1,343 psf.Not all new launches fared well, however. Oxley's The Rise@Oxley Residences - the only new launch in the Core Central Region (CCR) - sold eight units out of 120 at a median price of $2,452 psf.Ecco Development' Singa Hills and Macly Equity's Loft 33 managed to move only two units and 12 units respectively. These projects were apparently launched with little or no fanfare.\"Projects that lack visibility will see greater difficulty in attracting buyers, especially if they are not near transport nodes and the price point is not attractive,\" said Alice Tan, Knight Frank's head of research and consultancy.Colliers International director of research and advisory Chia Siew Chuin noted that Commonwealth Towers in Queenstown and Kallang Riverside in Kampong Bugis have benefited from pent-up demand, given the lack of new launches in the two locations.But developers' sales volume is expected to ease to 600-900 units in the traditional lull period of June, before developers resume their launches ahead of August, which is the lunar seventh month and regarded by the Chinese as an inauspicious period to commit to home purchases, Mr Chia said.Potential launches in the pipeline include Roxy-Pacific's Trilive, a freehold project in Tampines Road of which 70-80 per cent of the 222 units are dual-key units, which are essentially a 2-in-1 apartments.Wing Tai opened the showflat last Saturday for its 469-unit The Crest at Prince Charles Crescent, while China Sonangol Land and OKP Land are slated to launch their 109-unit freehold project Amber Skye on Amber Road soon.Nicholas Mak, executive director at SLP International, expects mass-market condos in suburban areas to continue leading sales islandwide.Last month, mass-market suburban condos accounted for 64 per cent of sales and slightly over half of total units launched.This is followed by city-fringe condos in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) that made up about 34 per cent of sales and 39 per cent of units launched. There were only 32 units sold in the CCR or 2 per cent of total islandwide sales.Mr Mak noted that some developers hurried to launch mass-market condos last month ahead of new EC launches this year. From August to December, five EC projects with a total of 3,100 units could potentially be launched for sale.With the increased competition, some developers may adopt \"a more flexible pricing strategy\" to boost their sales, he added. For the whole of 2014, sales volumes in the primary market could total 9,500-12,500 units, Mr Mak predicted. This compares with some 15,301 units sold by developers for the whole of last year."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

However, unlike the fictional city in those comics, The Metropolis by developer Ho Bee Land comprises twin solid office blocks of over 20 storeys each, sitting next to the Buona Vista MRT station in one-north. Since its completion in 4Q2013, The Metropolis has been home to MNC tenants such as Boston Scientific, P&G, Neptune Oriental Lines and General Electric. It is also Ho Bee\u2019s headquarters. On Nov 3, Ho Bee held the inauguration ceremony for The Metropolis. With 1.1 million sq ft in net lettable area, it is considered the single biggest office development outside the CBD. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was guest of honour at the official opening, which underscored the importance of the development, as well as one-north, as a hub for R&D, high-tech activities in biomedical sciences, IT, media and engineering industries. When Ho Bee broke ground for The Metropolis in March 2011, many industry observers were still uncertain about the viability of a pre mium office development in one-north, a suburban location more established as an R&D hub, recounts Chua Thian Poh, chairman of Ho Bee Land in his speech on Nov 3. However, with a mix of foresight and fortitude, the venture has paid off. Today, Metropolis is 95% leased, with average rents hovering around $6.50 psf per month, according to industry sources. With a development cost estimated at $800 million, it is the biggest investment property in the company\u2019s portfolio, and is regarded by Chua as \u201cHo Bee\u2019s crown jewel\u201d. The building marks \u201ca very significant upgrade\u201d in non-CBD office premises available for MNC tenants, says Chris Archibold, JLL\u2019s international director and head of markets. \u201cIn terms of specifications, it\u2019s comparable to those of Grade A office buildings in Raffles Place and Marina Bay.\u201d Ho Bee\u2019s first property may be an unglamorous Soon Wing Industrial Building on Aljunied Road in 1987. However, 16 years later, its name became synonymous with Sentosa Cove, billed as \u201cthe Monaco of the East\u201d. The company was a first mover in Sentosa Cove in 2003, when the 117ha reclaimed strip on the eastern edge of Sentosa Island was still untested. When the global financial crisis struck in 2008, \u201cwe took a hard look at our business model to see how we could make it more sustainable, more robust\u201d, says Chua. That led to the decision to build an investment portfolio with properties that will \u201cyield a more stable recurrent income stream\u201d. That, in turn, led to the inception of The Metropolis. To commemorate its official opening, Ho Bee made a $5 million donation to kick-start the SkillsFuture Jubilee Fund. The fund will be used for study awards, which will be given to those in the workforce who wish to pursue \u201cmastery in every skill and industry\u201d, said the Prime Minister in his speech.

The lunch-time crowd at My Awesome Caf\u00e9 The well-built Frenchman turned Singapore permanent resident (PR) shed 8kg in the first fortnight of opening the caf\u00e9 eight months ago. And it wasn\u2019t from pumping iron, he says, but from working from 7am to midnight almost every day. The bohemian caf\u00e9 with its vintage industrial vibe occupies the ground floor of a three-storey conservation shophouse that had once been a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) training centre. The Chung Hwa Medical Institution was started by the Singapore Chinese Physicians\u2019 Association to focus on research into TCM and provide training for Chinese physicians in TCM. The first Chung Hwa Free Clinic was established on the premises in 1952 to provide free TCM consultation to the poor and needy. However, over time, as the CBD area evolved, shophouses in Telok Ayer became popular as office space, especially among creative agencies, private-equity fund managers and architects, as well as F&B outlets, salons and boutiques. The number of TCM patients visiting the Telok Ayer clinic dwindled and it finally closed its doors in June 2005. The Chung Hwa Medical Institution headquarters were relocated to Toa Payoh. However, the building was gazetted by URA for conservation, given its historic significance, and the name on the building had to be preserved. The shophouse in Telok Ayer was vacant for a time, and then leased to Sun Moon, a retailer selling fruits, juices and health food, for a few years. Sun Moon has since moved to new premises across the street. Julien Liu, managing director of De Five Rings Productions, a musical production and stage works design company, took over the master tenancy of the building on a six-year lease with an option to renew for another six years. Liu had originally intended to turn the third level into a music studio, and was looking for a partner to operate the first two levels as an F&B outlet. There was keen interest in operating the space as an F&B outlet, and Liu considered more than 100 applications, but turned down every one of them. \u201cUltimately, in business, it\u2019s more than just about making money,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving back to society.\u201d For example, the rent from the shophouse in Telok Ayer is used to fund Chung Hwa Medical Institution\u2019s provision of free TCM for the poor. Bong and Hardy, the two active partners behind My Awesome Caf\u00e9 \u2018Bringing back the old Singapore\u2019It wasn\u2019t long before S C Bong, digital partner at creative agency Mangham Gaxiola, happened to walk by the shophouse in Telok Ayer and saw Liu cleaning it. He asked whether the unit was up for lease, as his creative agency was looking to move from Neil Road. After some discussion, it was agreed that the creative agency would become a sub-tenant, taking up the two upper levels, while a tenant in the F&B business would take up the first level. A property agent was engaged to find a suitable tenant. However, Bong wanted to screen potential F&B operators, as, unlike most shophouses, where there is a separate entrance to the upper levels, the one at the Telok Ayer shophouse was through the first level. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want a bak kut teh shop or something like that, as the entrance to the agency is from the first level,\u201d he explains. As no suitable F&B operator could be found, Bong convinced his friend, Hardy, to set up a caf\u00e9 there. \u201cWhen we saw the fa\u00e7ade, we thought we could bring the old Singapore back to the shophouse,\u201d says Hardy. \u201cI know Singapore is all about new buildings, but we wanted to preserve the rich history of the building, which is more than 60 years old, and find items that will capture the past.\u201d He signed a five-year lease as a sub-tenant for the 1,800 sq ft space on the first level. Hardy, Bong and a friend became owners of the caf\u00e9. While Hardy and Bong were actively involved in setting up the caf\u00e9, their friend preferred to be a sleeping partner. The name and logo of My Awesome Caf\u00e9 was created by Bong. \u201cIt\u2019s partly because I use \u2018awesome\u2019 a lot, too much perhaps,\u201d he confesses. \u201cAnd we wanted a name that can give the customers a sense of belonging. We now have customers who come almost every day, and when they say, \u2018Let\u2019s go to My Awesome Caf\u00e9\u2019, it gives them a sense of ownership. It has become their caf\u00e9.\u201d Bong also created a logo that represents east and west, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t easy to do when you\u2019re working with Chinese characters\u201d, he says. Meanwhile, Hardy conceptualised the kitchen space and seating, as he would be involved in the day-to-day running of the caf\u00e9. A former hotelier with a background in F&B, Hardy had arrived in Singapore nine years ago. He was a former F&B director at the Swiss\u00f4tel The Stamford and played a key role in starting up the St Regis Singapore, where he headed the F&B operations before becoming the general manager of Quincy Hotel at Mount Elizabeth. He then spent three years as the general manager of One\u00b015 Marina Club in Sentosa Cove. It was while he was general manager of the Hotel Fort Canning that he was hit by the entrepreneurial bug and was persuaded by Bong to start the caf\u00e9. They took two days to come up with the concept for the caf\u00e9 and then drove around Singapore, stopping at places they didn\u2019t typically visit, such as warehouses in Eunos, Kallang and Ubi. A lot of the antiques and furniture in the caf\u00e9 were accidental finds purchased from elderly men who are self-professed hoarders, says Bong. For example, while driving past a warehouse one day, they saw old school chairs stacked outside. Upon further enquiry, the owner of the warehouse, \u201can old uncle\u201d, let them into the building and showed them his entire collection. He even gave them free rein to wander around and pick out the things they wanted for their caf\u00e9. Many of the antiques, school chairs, wall fans and school desks at the caf\u00e9 came from that warehouse, says Hardy. The pair even drove to Muar, Johor and to Melaka to hunt down vintage amber glassware and other items. \u201cWe went to those mom-and-pop shops that hadn\u2019t sold anything for the last 40 years, and [the proprietors] were elated when we bought vintage plates and glasses from them,\u201d says Bong, the self-appointed negotiator. It was in one of these glass shops that Hardy spotted an old wood-and-glass cabinet built by the shopowner and his wife in 1970. They had used it as a filing cabinet and were more than happy to sell it to the pair for RM10. It is now used as a display cabinet for the cakes and pastries in the caf\u00e9. Besides the restored 1970s school desks in the caf\u00e9, there are a number of dining tables and high stools designed by Ah Keong, a contractor who specialises in fire protection pipe fittings and who did the piping for the caf\u00e9. He fashioned the legs from pipes, and used old wooden doors and recycled teak for the tabletops and stool seats. Against the oddsRenovation of the interior of the shophouse had started at almost the same time as the relic hunt. New wiring, plumbing and flooring had to be installed, and even the walls had to be redone. \u201cWhen we took over the place, it was in pretty bad shape,\u201d recalls Bong. \u201cTo save costs, I became the project manager, and we went direct to the electrician, plumber and tiler. It was an intense three months.\u201d While Bong was the project manager, Hardy was the runner who took care of the planning submissions for electricity and plumbing, and made sure all the necessary permits from the authorities were obtained. \u201cI\u2019ve opened hotels and restaurants in the past, but as an F&B director, you have a whole team working for you,\u201d says Hardy. \u201cFor the first time, I was doing everything myself.\u201d The entire renovation took three months, and costs, including furniture and accessories, totalled just under $200,000. \u201cIf we had engaged an interior designer and architect, it would have cost us at least $500,000, but we did everything ourselves to save money,\u201d says Hardy. And the day he received the letter of approval from the National Environment Agency was the day the caf\u00e9 opened: on Feb 6, at 6pm, which coincided with the seventh day of the Chinese New Year, traditionally known as ren ri, or everybody\u2019s birthday. In the CBD area, most F&B outlets cater to the office crowd, and few open on week nights, and even fewer on weekends. But Hardy took the risk of opening until 11pm every night, and even on weekends. \u201cIt was a gamble,\u201d he admits. \u201cOn Saturdays and Sundays, the CBD area is dead, but when you pass by My Awesome Caf\u00e9, it\u2019s full.\u201d There is a growing trend of F&B outlets that cater for the lunchtime crowd in the day and serve as a watering hole for patrons who come after work. My Awesome Caf\u00e9 has become a popular all-day coffee meeting place. While there are many interesting F&B concepts in the CBD, the number of conservation shophouses is limited to just 1,400 units, according to Colliers. Rental rates for shophouses are still slightly lower than those for the ground floor of office buildings. For example, in the Boat Quay area, the rental rates for eateries in shophouses, where the ambience is a blend of nostalgia and the modern, range from $8 to $12 psf per month, according to Colliers. In the Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood, F&B outlets in shophouses pay between $9 and $12 psf per month in rent. Rent and manpower are two of the biggest costs for F&B outlets. As a master tenant of the three-storey shophouse, Liu is happy with the success of his new sub-tenants. \u201cThe landlord\u2019s initial worry was that [the caf\u00e9] couldn\u2019t be sustained,\u201d he concedes. \u201cEven I didn\u2019t expect the caf\u00e9 to do so well.\u201d The shelves of the kitchen of the caf\u00e9 are filled with memorabilia and collectibles from the 1960s and 1970s \u2018Not a chef\u2019s kitchen\u2019Hardy, who had put his entire savings into the business, recouped his investment within the first year. \u201cIt is unusual in the F&B business,\u201d he admits. He reckons it\u2019s because the menu is mainly salads and sandwiches. And unlike most shophouses, where the kitchen takes up half the floor space, the one at Awesome Caf\u00e9 occupies a small area, which means more space for customers. \u201cIt\u2019s not a chef\u2019s kitchen,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of my friends who are chefs think this is a horrible kitchen, but it works well for us.\u201d Even though the caf\u00e9 has been operational for just eight months, the owners have already been approached by people asking if they are interested in opening more caf\u00e9s in Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Penang and even London and Dubai. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to expand so fast,\u201d says Hardy. \u201cWe want to pass the one-year mark before we think about growing.\u201d Over the years, many F&B outlets in the shophouses within the CBD have come and gone. They close, and new ones sprout up to take their place. \u201cThe most important is to get the concept right,\u201d says Bong.

On a recent Friday afternoon, the owner of a Good Class Bungalow (GCB) on Rebecca Road was seen leisurely reading the newspapers at the dining table, while his daughter-in-law was about to start baking a cake, with her son perched on a high stool at the kitchen counter, finishing his homework. This heart-warming scene could easily have been set in an HDB apartment, if not for the astute house owner. He made the leap from HDB occupier to GCB owner in a single, well-timed bound in March 1999 \u2014 which, on hindsight, was the trough of the property cycle. According to a caveat lodged with URA Realis, he paid just $5.5 million for the GCB, which sits on a sprawling 20,450 sq ft site. Not only is it the largest land plot in the Rebecca Road area, but his purchase price, when translated into price per sq ft, stood at $269, the lowest on record for the neighbourhood. Even if one were to include the other GCB enclaves in the vicinity, such as Bin Tong Park, Coronation Road and Coronation Road West, as well as Victoria Park, that transaction still ranks among the lowest in terms of price psf, based on caveat data going back nearly 20 years. Indeed, in the post-Asian financial crisis property market hangover of 1998/99 and the economic recession of 2001 to 2003, quite a number of HDB occupiers made that same transition into the landed housing market, snapping up semi-detached and detached houses at distressed prices, recalls Grace Ng, deputy managing director at Colliers International. \u201cHowever, only a rare few had jumped from an HDB to a GCB.\u201d Today, 5.5% of Singaporean households live in landed homes, and an even smaller fraction live in GCBs, the most luxurious of bungalows with land sizes of at least 15,070 sq ft. After all, there are only 2,800 GCBs in Singapore and they are located in 39 residential estates gazetted by the URA, according to CBRE Research. Meanwhile, a good 81.9% of Singapore residents live in HDB flats, according to the Department of Statistics. Complete rebuild The owner of the Rebecca Road GCB made only minor additions and alterations to it over the years. However, in mid-2011, he decided to tear down the original structure and redevelop the property to suit the needs of his now-extended family. As the natural terrain of the site is on a downslope, the then single-storey bungalow used to sit at the bottom of the garden, below street level. Upon the recommendation of friends, the owner engaged Timur Designs, a name long associated with private luxury homes in the prime districts of Singapore and in Sentosa Cove, to design his new GCB. The only brief he gave the architect was that he and his wife wanted a home where they could age in place, with wheelchair-friendly floors and provision for a home lift in the future. The owner\u2019s son, who was living in the same house with his wife and two young child ren, asked for their own private wing fitted with a kitchenette, like a self-contained apartment, with direct access to the swimming pool. Timur Designs partner Chan Wai Kin, the design architect for the house, cleverly created a formal entrance with a drop-off point at the front of the building. \u201cThe idea was to create a sense of mystery when you first arrive,\u201d explains the owner. Double-volume ceiling and glass louvres add light to the semi-outdoor dining patio By moving the formal entrance to the front of the grounds, the architect capitalised on the downsloping terrain to create a spacious, double- storey house with two wings, and ample space for the swimming pool and garden. There is a separate entrance from the garage at the side of the house for the family. Chan created indoor-outdoor spaces, where the main focus is the swimming pool. There is even an outdoor powder room that looks like a secret garden, complete with a stone bench. The communal gathering point for the family is the semi-outdoor dining patio with double- volume ceiling. The adjoining dry kitchen and dining patio command the best view of the pool and garden. Glass louvres at the top of the patio can be opened for breeze to flow into the house, or closed to prevent rain from coming in. An enormous ceiling fan has been installed to keep the place cool. \u201cWe seldom need to turn on the air-conditioner,\u201d says the owner. \u201cWe like the architect\u2019s design, which has a rustic feel, and his play with glass and timber. We didn\u2019t want a show house. We wanted a home we can relax in.\u201d The bathroom of the junior master suite This staircase from the formal guest entrance leads to the dining patio Three-generation homeThe house has a built-up area of 7,440 sq ft. On the first level, apart from the dining patio, a spacious living room opens out to the swimming pool. There is a separate wet kitchen adjoining the dry kitchen, an aviary, a helper\u2019s room and a yard. The master suite for the owner and his wife is also on the first level. It has a big en suite study \u2014 the owner\u2019s favourite room \u2014 with a door leading directly to the swimming pool. Two other bedrooms are on this level; one serves as a guest room, while the other has been converted into a hobby room, complete with musical instruments and model airplanes. The second level was designed as a standalone apartment for the younger family. It has a junior master suite with a dramatic ceiling, an equally luxurious bathroom, two bedrooms for the children, another study and a fully-equipped galley kitchen. There is also a private balcony, with staircase leading straight to the swimming pool. Construction of the new house took 17 months and cost $3 million, with the family moving back into their \u201cnew\u201d home in December 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-thought-out design for an extended family,\u201d says Harvey Chia, director of boutique property agency Land Empire. On the marketThe property was recently put on the market with a price tag of $35 million or $1,711 psf. \u201cGiven a choice, I wouldn\u2019t want to sell it,\u201d admits the owner. \u201cMy wife is the one who wants to sell it.\u201d Land Empire\u2019s Chia has been appointed the marketing agent for the GCB on Rebecca Road. He has noticed an increase in the number of enquiries from potential buyers looking for GCBs with bigger land plots in recent months. This is also evident from the GCB transactions in 3Q2014: of the half-dozen transactions in the months of July and August, three were for large GCB plots that fetched above $30 million. The most recent transaction was for a GCB sitting on a freehold plot of 26,458 sq ft on Belmont Road, that was sold for $33.5 million ($1,266 psf), according to a caveat lodged on Aug 21. The other GCB on Dalvey Road sits on a land area of 18,493 sq ft, and changed hands for $30.8 million ($1,666 psf) at end- July. The house on Dalvey Road is a brand new GCB sitting on a smaller land parcel, notes William Wong, managing director of RealStar Premier and a specialist in marketing landed homes. In mid-July, a GCB sitting on a freehold plot of 33,691 sq ft on Ridout Road was reportedly sold to Lim Hock Leng, managing director of listed grocery chain Sheng Siong, for $30 million ($1,039 psf). The GCB is said to be an old bungalow located on a downslope site. Most GCBs sacrifice the garden for a bigger house. The Rebecca Road GCB still has space for a large garden for the owner\u2019s grandchildren to play in One of the children\u2019s bedrooms The junior master suite with a balcony that leads straight to the swimming pool deck below New rich, new citizensThe buyers looking to purchase big GCB plots today tend to be \u201cthe new rich\u201d and \u201cfirsttime GCB buyers\u201d, says Samuel Eyo, director of Savills Prestige Homes. \u201cIt also shows that there\u2019s still a lot of money out there.\u201d KH Tan, founder and managing director of luxury property specialist Newsman Realty, agrees. He has seen an increase in enquiries and viewing requests from newly minted Singa pore citizens interested in buying big GCB plots with land sizes above 20,000 sq ft. \u201cThese are mainly former mainland Chinese who are buying their first landed property in Singapore,\u201d Tan notes. There are some Singaporeans who, having lived abroad for many years, have returned home and are looking to buy a GCB as well, he adds. However, more than half the enquiries are from newly minted Singapore citizens. Figures from CBRE Research show that for the full year of 2013, a total of 27 GCBs were sold for $654 million, or an average of $1,323 psf. For the first nine months of 2014, only 18 GCBs were transacted, with total sales worth $467.8 million. The average price of these transactions yearto- date was $1,419 psf, which is higher than that in 2013. However, this is only a ballpark for GCB prices, and does not fully account for location, size, age, design, terrain, frontage and other characteristics of the individual GCBs, explains Douglas Wong, CBRE\u2019s head of luxury homes, and a specialist in the GCB market. \u201cAt best, it shows that GCB prices in 2014 are still holding up even though the wider residential market prices are softening.\u201d Newsman\u2019s Tan agrees. GCBs sitting on good plots, for instance those that are either elevated or flat, and regular in shape, have seen prices holding up relatively well on a per sq ft basis, he says. Those that are not as well situated, for instance those on a steep downslope or sitting on an irregular plot, have seen prices soften a little. However, he expects activity in the GCB market to pick up this quarter and foresees prices remaining rela tively stable in the coming year. The outdoor powder room with a shower area for guests Scarcity factor\u201cI think we are probably close to the bottom in terms of transaction volume this year,\u201d reckons RealStar\u2019s Wong. \u201cBut the real-estate market as a whole should start to improve next year. As such, it is unlikely that there will be a great correction ahead in the landed housing market, especially for GCBs, where the vast majority of owners have great holding power.\u201d The gap between buyers\u2019 bid prices and sellers\u2019 asking prices could narrow in the coming months owing to the scarcity of big plots, notes Land Empire\u2019s Chia. Many GCB owners are prepared to withdraw their property from the market if buyers\u2019 offers are below their asking prices, says Savills\u2019 Eyo. \u201cThat\u2019s why there isn\u2019t much GCB stock in the market.\u201d CBRE\u2019s Wong concurs with that. GCB owners who have the holding power will not reduce their prices just to achieve a sale, he says. \u201cThey are more likely to wait for the market to recover before looking for buyers again.\u201d According to Chia, buyers attracted to the Rebecca Road area in prime district 10 are usually those familiar with the Leedon Park, Bin Tong Park and Belmont areas as well. Besides the recent transaction in Belmont Road for $33.5 million, another transaction in the neighbourhood this year was for a GCB in Bin Tong Park, sitting on a freehold land area of 20,312 sq ft. It was sold for $31.5 million ($1,551 psf) in February. \u201cThe owner [of the GCB on Rebecca Road] is in no rush to sell,\u201d emphasises Chia. \u201cIf we find the right buyer who can appreciate the house as much as they do, and if there\u2019s a serious offer, we will sit together with the family to discuss [the deal].\u201d This article appeared in the City & Country of Issue 647 (Oct 13) of The Edge Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Even then, Leny Suparman still feels it lacks \u201ca sense of arrival\u201d. The 40-year-old CEO of KOP Properties is part of a consortium that purchased a 92.8% stake in Prudential Tower for $512 million in May. CBRE had brokered the sale. The other consortium partners in the purchase of Prudential Tower are Lian Beng Group, KSH Holdings and Centurion Global. The seller was Keppel REIT, which had upgraded the office tower. According to Suparman, the consortium is likely to spend \u201ca couple of million dollars\u201d on aesthetic enhancements to create a grander sense of arrival. This includes upgrading the tenant directory, reception desk, as well as the main entrance and the entrance from the vehicular drop-off area. The security officer\u2019s uniform is also likely to be changed to a full black. \u201cIt will be like arriving at a five-star hotel,\u201d she says. After all, Suparman is a connoisseur of such luxury touches, having been involved in the development of upscale condominium projects such as The Ritz-Carlton Residences on Cairnhill Road and Reignwood Hamilton Scotts (formerly known as The Hamilton Scotts). Even as the cosmetic touches are applied, the consortium p a r t n e r s have already sold half a floor on a strata-titled basis to a mainland Chinese state-owned enterprise, Shanghai Tunnel Engineering (Singapore) Pte Ltd. The company, which has a presence in Singapore, is said to be working on a number of projects for the Land Transport Authority (LTA). The purchase price for the half-floor unit of 5,952 sq ft on the 11th floor of Prudential Tower was $2,750 psf, which translates to $16.368 million. The sale of the half-floor unit was on a private treaty basis and brokered by CBRE. The 11th floor was put up for sale first as the tenancy is expiring next year. The unit appeals to those looking to occupy the space within the next 12 months, says Jeremy Lake, executive director of investment properties at CBRE, who is handling the marketing of the property. Artist\u2019s impression of the vehicular drop-off area Priced from $2,800 psfGiven the success of the first sale, the other half unit on the 11th floor has been put on the market for sale by an expression of interest exercise (EOI) conducted by CBRE. The EOI will close on Nov 27. The second unit is slightly smaller at 5,102 sq ft, and priced from $2,800 psf, which translates to about $14.3 million. Prudential Tower strata unit up for sale from $2,800 psf The 30-storey Prudential Tower, where an 11thfloor strata unit has just been sold for $2,750 psf, and another unit is on the market At Prudential Tower, the offices start from the 10th floor. Up to the 19th floor, there are two office units per floor, with separate strata titles. From the 20th to 30th floors, there is only a unit per floor of some 11,000 sq ft, each with its own strata title. Prudential Tower presents a good opportunity for those looking to purchase strata office units, says Suparman. \u201cEvery sector has been affected by the property cooling measures except for commercial,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen we bought the property [Prudential Tower], it was quite opportunistic. Because it was a strata-titled property, we had the flexibility of selling some floors and keeping some for recurrent income.\u201d Prudential Tower has a 99-year lease with effect from 1996 (expiring in January 2095), and the acquisition by the consortium of the 92.8% stake is for an aggregate strata area of 21,433 sq m (about 230,705 sq ft). The price translates to $2,316 psf based on net lettable area. Based on the consortium\u2019s purchase price, the net rental yield is about 3.5%. And with office rents on an upward trend, yield could potentially reach 4%. Even based on the selling price of $2,800 psf, the yield works out to 3.25%, adds Suparman. According to CBRE, Grade A office rents stood at $10.95 psf per month as at end-3Q2014, up 3.3% q-o-q. Meanwhile, average Grade B office rents in the CBD Core area was at $8.50 psf per month, an increase of 2.4% q-o-q. Suparman says the consortium intends to keep about 30% of the strata space at Prudential Tower for recurring rental income, while selling the others on a strata-titled basis. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a hurry to sell,\u201d she emphasises. \u201cIt all depends on the offer.\u201d Based on the profile of the recent buyer of the strata office unit at Prudential Tower, as well as at the recent sales at Samsung Hub and Springleaf Tower, it is evident that many companies are buying for their own use, says CBRE\u2019s Lake. He reckons about half the demand is attributed to mainland Chinese companies, while the other half is a mix of Singaporean, Indian and Indonesian companies. Artist\u2019s impression of the lobby after aesthetic enhancements Pocket of activity\u2019The 28-storey Equity Plaza located across the road from Prudential Tower was sold to another consortium, led by GSH Corp, for $550 million in June. The tenants in the building were recently served notice to move out as the new owners intend to embark on an asset- enhancement exercise. \u201cSome of them have come over to take a look, and have indicated that they are looking to buy,\u201d says Lake. Sitting opposite Prudential Tower is the upcoming CapitaGreen, a 40-storey landmark office tower designed by acclaimed Japanese architect Toyo Ito. The building is jointly owned and developed by CapitaLand, CapitaCommercial Trust and Mitsubishi Estate Asia. Targeted to be completed by year-end, the office tower with 700,000 sq ft is already more than 20% pre-leased, and tenants include the likes of commodities trading giant Cargill, Swiss private bank Bordier & Cie, insurance brokers Jardine Lloyd Thompson, international law firm Jones Day and an international gym operator. Meanwhile, Prudential Tower has an MRT entrance sitting right in front of the building. It therefore has a catchment of its own, attracting even those who are looking to move from a shophouse in the CBD area to a more conventional office space with a bigger floor plate and more amenities. \u201cThe little pocket where Prudential Tower, Equity Plaza and the upcoming Capita-Green are located has become a hub of activity,\u201d says Lake.

Only give me the value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "SINGAPORE:For more than a decade, entrepreneur Jason Lee has been known for his K Box karaoke centres, and investments in Japanese restaurant chains and forlorn cinemas. Some of his boldest bets have been in property, and his recent launch, Forte Suites, is the biggest and most upscale yet. Jason Lee turns off his mobile phone in mid-ring and slips it into the pocket of his well-cut granite-coloured Gucci suit. He then leads the way into one of the showflats at Forte Suites, where the main highlight is a black-and-gold tiled Jacuzzi ingeniously built into the balcony of a master bedroom. \u201cYou are not going to find apartments anywhere else with a Jacuzzi right next to the bed,\u201d says the raspy-voiced 50-year-old entrepreneur. \u201cIt is a heated pool with water jets and very relaxing, like water therapy.\u201d Lee, developer and chairman of JForte Group of Companies, is eager to point out aspects of Forte Suites that make it stand out amid the milieu of nondescript condominium blocks in the Rangoon Road neighbourhood. He says the 106-unit condo is the most upmarket and biggest project in his stable in terms of the number of units. The other developments in his portfolio have so far been boutique freehold projects of less than 100 units. For example, the newly completed 52-unit Jool Suites and 34-unit condo 8 Farrer Suites are located in the Rangoon Road neighbourhood as well. Two other developments \u2014 Central Imperial and 28 Imperial Residences \u2014 are in Geylang Lorong 14 and Lorong 26 respectively. While his portfolio of residential projects may sound relatively modest, Lee could well be on track to become another Ching Chiat Kwong of Oxley Holdings, James Koh of Fragrance Group or some version of the two. Both entrepreneurs had their start in developing shoebox apartments in equally inglorious neighbourhoods but have since morphed into diversified property groups with market capitalisation well above $1.5 billion. Lee knows both gentlemen well, and pronounces them to be \u201cvery hardworking and growing very fast\u201d. Lee believes everything is about \u201ctiming\u201d. Regardless of good or bad timing, he reckons his latest develop\u00adment presents a \u201clow-risk\u201d investment opportunity. With a prosperous-sounding address of 88 Mergui Road, Forte Suites is within walking distance of Connexion, the Farrer Park medical cluster comprising a private hospital, medical centre and hotel-and-spa linked to the Farrer Park MRT station. Across the road from Connexion is the upcoming Farrer Square by RB Capital, which is also linked to the MRT station, and contains medical suites as well as a 300-room Park Hotel. Doctors and others in the medical profession who have their practices in the Farrer Park medical cluster and want to live near their workplace will find Forte Suites appealing, he says. Even medical tourists who come to Singapore regularly for treatment and travel with their family members will find it more worthwhile to purchase a residential unit than staying in a hotel or serviced apartment, he reasons. \u2018Hotel-style condo\u2019Lee has therefore positioned Forte Suites as a \u201chotel-style condominium\u201d, with frills such as 24-hour concierge service, a 37m swimming pool and sky gardens on the upper floors, with facilities such as Jacuzzis, an outdoor gym, a yoga deck, sports lounge and billiard lounge. Buy-to-let investors will find ready demand from nurses and other personnel working in the medical hub who want to live close to their workplace, he explains. He calculates that a master bedroom, especially one with an en suite Jacuzzi, can be leased for up to $1,800 a month, while a common bedroom with shared bathroom can be tenanted for $1,000 to $1,400, depending on the size. A three-bedroom apartment at Forte Suites with a price tag of just over $1 million can therefore fetch a monthly rental rate of $4,000, he estimates, translating into a rental yield of 4%. Soft-launched on Sept 6, about 20% of the units in Forte Suites have been sold prior to the official launch on Sept 27. Prices start from $1,600 psf, or more than $700,000, for a one-bedroom unit of 441 sq ft. There are only 16 one-bedroom units, measuring 441 to 474 sq ft. Another 68 units are two-bedroom apartments measuring 603 to 700 sq ft, of which 19 come with the en suite private Jacuzzis. Another 16 units are three-bedroom apartments of 624 sq ft, with six penthouses of 1,033 to 1,227 sq ft. The Forte Suites site is a redevelop\u00adment of an old block of apartments with shops on the first level. The site was purchased three years ago, but the process took two years to complete, as he had to buy each unit from the individual owners in private-treaty deals. By early next year, he will be tearing down the block of apartments to build Forte Suites, which is scheduled to be completed in 2018. The project sits directly across from the soon-to-be-completed 250-unit Cityscape @ Farrer Park by listed construction company-cum-property developer KSH Holdings and Malaysia\u2019s IOI Group. As at end-August, 224 units were sold, with the latest transaction at a median price of $1,515 psf. Hotel playsAnother sector that Lee is actively invested in is hospitality. He was instrumental in bringing listed construction company and property developer Lian Beng Group into the acquisition of Midlink Plaza, a nine-storey strata-titled commercial building, purchased three years ago for $126.8 million. The deal was said to be done \u201cin just 24 hours\u201d \u2014 over drinks at KTV lounge Lido Palace around midnight, and concluded at noon in Lee\u2019s office the following day. Lian Beng Group invested in the joint venture through its associated company, Millennium Land, which took a 50% stake. Lee\u2019s Billion Land held the remaining 50%. Midlink Plaza had 68 years left on its 99-year lease but, given its prominent frontage on Middle Road and Queen Street, it could be redeveloped into a 16-storey hotel property with 450 to 500 rooms. Last month, however, the joint-venture partners agreed to sell the property to China\u2019s Nanshan Group for $270 million, according to a Singapore Exchange filing by Lian Beng. The property that marked Lee\u2019s foray into hospitality sector was the conversion of a row of conservation shophouses on Mosque Street four years ago into the Porcelain Hotel. He had originally purchased three adjacent shophouses in a joint venture with listed beauty and wellness centre operator, Mary Chia Holdings, whose CEO is Lee\u2019s wife, Wendy Ho. The joint-venture company, called Hotel Culture, paid $20 million for the three shophouses and pumped in another $6 million to refurbish and fit out the rooms. The 84-room Porcelain Hotel opened in February 2010. Two years later, Lee purchased the remaining two shophouses on Mosque Street from CTC Tourism Holdings, owner of travel agency CTC Travel. This added another 52 rooms to the inventory. \u201cWhen I first did it [Porcelain Hotel], everybody said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut the value of the hotel has appreciated.\u201d The Porcelain Hotel is the only property investment in his portfolio that Mary Chia Holdings\u2019 Ho has participated in. \u201cWe both work very hard,\u201d says Lee. He first met Ho when he went for a facial at one of Mary Chia\u2019s beauty and wellness centres. Besides reaping the benefits of healthy glowing skin, he walked out of the centre with a wife as a bonus. The couple has three children: a son aged 17 and two daughters aged 12 and 13. Two years ago, Lee took over the operations of the 70-room Kam Leng Hotel on Jalan Besar on a 20-year lease. The owners of the Kam Leng Hotel are the Chow brothers, who formerly owned Chow House on Robinson Road. Lee retained the nostalgic feel and charm of the property, and made only minor additions and updates, he says. Malaysian betsIn recent years, Malaysia had also beckoned. In May 2013, he and a Singaporean business partner purchased the 458-room Radius International Hotel in the prime shopping district of Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur for RM160 million ($62.4 million). The property will be renamed Hotel Soleil before October, and additions and alterations to increase the room count to 562 will begin next year. In Melaka, Lee is a stakeholder of four plots of costal land in the vicinity of Mahkota Hotel and Holiday Inn. The parcels are reclaimed land with 99-year leases and purchased in joint ventures with other investors, including billionaire Sam Goi, the \u201cPopiah King\u201d turned property player, and listed Centurion Group, which owns and operates students\u2019 and workers\u2019 accommodation assets. One of the sites will be developed into a mixed-use scheme with a hotel, shopping mall and cultural village. It is scheduled for launch in 1H2015. Lee says his forte lies in repositioning commercial assets, especially cinemas. In 2000, for instance, he purchased the former Broadway Cinema, adjacent to the Ang Mo Kio Central market and hawker centre, for $9 million. He turned it into Broadway Plaza, an entertainment and retail complex with a K Box karaoke centre. The property was sold three years ago to a group of private investors. Likewise, he purchased the former Plaza Cinema on the upper floors of Textile Centre for $4.7 million in 2007. He turned it into a performance theatre, and subsequently it became Singapore\u2019s biggest Thai discotheque, Club Atlantis. The club closed in 2010, and Lee sold the property for $12 million. The space is now occupied by a church. The first property he purchased was back in 1986, when he was just 22. It was a shophouse near Jalan Besar Stadium that he bought for $500,000, and sold three years later for $1.2 million. In the early to mid-1990s, some of his investments were strata-titled factory units in Henderson industrial estate, an office building and a stake in Punggol Marina. During the Asian financial crisis in 1997/98, he suffered losses, along with everyone else, he says. \u2018True grit\u2019Lee, the 11th of 12 children who grew up in a kampung in Ang Mo Kio, knows the meaning of sheer grit and hard work. His parents were vegetable sellers with a stall in the Ghim Moh Market and, from a young age, Lee helped at the vegetable stall after school and on weekends. \u201cWhen you work for your father, you don\u2019t get paid,\u201d he says. To earn an income, he worked in an assortment of jobs \u2014 as a labourer unloading sacks of rice, a waiter with a catering company, helping one of his brothers who runs an electrical appliances store, and painting tombstones during the Qingming Festival or Tomb Sweeping Day. At one point, after he left school, he even operated a \u201cmobile market\u201d in the evenings, selling vegetables and fish to the construction workers in the Yishun area, as there were many construction sites there. \u201cIt was very tough because we were very poor,\u201d he recounts. \u201cWe had to work from morning to night, 365 days a year.\u201d Before the age of 22, the only break he enjoyed each year was a half day on the eve of Chinese New Year. He has long left those days of selling vegetables behind, and is now a Gucci-clad entrepreneur, with his primary residence in the exclusive Chancery Hill area, a Good Class Bungalow under development on Cluny Hill, and a weekend bungalow on Sandy Island in the upscale Sentosa Cove. Beyond property, Lee owns Suki Group of Restaurants, with a chain of family-friendly Japanese restaurants, which he invested in 12 years ago. That was also when he launched K Box, a chain of karaoke entertainment centres that are family-friendly and not sleazy, he emphasises. The first outlet opened in Choa Chu Kang in 2002 and, by 2011, there were 12 K Box outlets, with a turnover of $33.5 million. The K Box chain was sold in March this year to a Japanese group. Will he eventually list his group of companies? \u201cIf the timing is right,\u201d says Lee. For now, he wants to focus on his hotel investments, mixed-use developments in Melaka and residential plays on Singapore\u2019s city fringe. \u201cWe try to build something that\u2019s different from others, so even in the worst crisis, we can survive.\u201d This article appeared in the City & Country of Issue 645 (Sept 29) of The Edge Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Artist and musician of America\u2019s Got Talent fame William Close says he turns \u201centire architecture into [a musical] instrument\u201d. He has performed that feat at the Shanghai Grand Theatre in China, the Colosseum in Rome, the Space Needle observation tower in Seattle, Washington and even the Singapore National Museum in August. Close has now set his sights on something on a more massive scale at d\u2019Leedon, Singapore\u2019s biggest private condominium. With 16 strings extending up to 935ft from the rooftop of the clubhouse to the apex of one of the highrise towers, Close will turn the development into a giant harp. And he will perform his ethereal Earth Harp Mini Symphony at the project\u2019s completion party on the evening of Oct 25. Close\u2019s musical feat could temporarily dispel the gathering gloom in the property market even if it is for just one evening, and could provide an uplift to the sentiments of the owners of units at d\u2019Leedon. Among the 3,000 to 4,000 invited guests expected to attend the condo\u2019s completion party, many are buyers of the units and some will also be residents. The market\u2019s concern is the total number of private residential units expected to be completed by yearend. The figure is currently estimated at 17,082 units as at end-2Q2014, according to DTZ Research. That figure excludes d\u2019Leedon\u2019s 1,715 units; if included, they would account for 10% of total new supply. Next year will see close to 22,000 units completed, with another 23,876 units in 2016, according to Lee Lay Keng, DTZ\u2019s regional head of research. \u201cThe total number of units projected to be completed by year-end is around 20,000, which is the highest new completion figure on record, to be surpassed by only the numbers in 2015 and 2016,\u201d says Donald Han, managing director of Chesterton Singapore. Property agents and consultants are now speculating on the number of units that will resurface in the secondary market for sale and lease in the coming months. This figure is likely to have a major impact on rents and prices in the area. \u201cMy guess is that 30% to 40% of the buyers are owner-occupiers, which means close to 70% are investors. So, we could see some of these units come up for lease and some for resale,\u201d says Jacqueline Wong, senior director of residential leasing and ad hoc sales at Savills Singapore. This could lead to \u201csome stiff competition\u201d among the individual owners within the development, especially for tenants, she adds. The handover of the units in the project is expected to be carried out in phases, which Wong says will contain the deluge entering the market and limit the potential fallout. \u2018Positive re-rating\u2019On the other hand, new developments, especially a landmark project such as d\u2019Leedon, could be \u201ca positive re-rating catalyst\u201d in the neighbourhood, in terms of both pricing and rental levels, says Chesterton\u2019s Han. \u201cAnyone driving past Farrer Road could not miss those towers, which are the tallest in the area, so it will not be difficult getting tenants to view the development. It could have a positive effect in that area,\u201d he adds. D\u2019Leedon is the largest private residential development in Singapore so far and the first high-rise residential project designed by world-renowned architect Zaha Hadid. With Good Class Bungalows (GCBs) and mainly 12-storey condos in the vicinity, its seven \u201cpetal-like\u201d, 36-storey towers are highly visible and instantly recognisable, says Wong Meng Kwan, CapitaLand Singapore\u2019s senior manager of design management (residential), who has been involved in the project since 2008. \u201cBeing the tallest in the area means they have the best views, even from the mid- and high-floor units,\u201d says a property agent who declines to be named. Besides its proximity to the Farrer Road MRT station, the project is also close to eateries and shops at Holland Village, Chip Bee Gardens and Dempsey Hill, within a short driving distance of the CBD and Orchard Road, as well as the Botanic Gardens, he adds. Apart from the seven curvaceous high-rise towers, there are also 12 futuristic semi-detached villas that look out onto the GCB area. D\u2019Leedon sits on a sprawling 848,049 sq ft site and is a redevelopment of the former Farrer Court privatised HUDC estate. The 618- unit Farrer Court was purchased en bloc by a CapitaLand-led consortium back in 2007 for $1.34 billion, and it is still the largest en bloc purchase, in terms of the number of units involved in the collective sale and the price tag. The consortium partners are Capita Land, with the biggest stake of 35%; Hotel Properties Ltd (22.5%); a fund managed by Morgan Stanley Real Estate (22.5%); and Wachovia Development Corp, a unit of Wells Fargo & Co (20%). \u201cBy virtue of the tapering of the towers as they meet the ground, they occupy only 22% of the site, thus freeing up more space for facilities and landscape,\u201d says CapitaLand\u2019s Wong. Recreational facilities include two clubhouses, gyms and aqua gyms, a playground, a \u201cmaze garden\u201d, a remote control car race track, a full-sized basketball court, two tennis courts and an outdoor exercise corner. The facilities are clustered such that parents and grandparents can work out while keeping an eye on their children and grandchildren, he says. Theatres for screening movies and reading rooms are also some of the facilities in the development. The facilities, from the playground and outdoor gym to the theatre, were specifically designed for d\u2019Leedon, and there is a subtle hint of Hadid\u2019s favourite colour: purple. Competitive pricingAs at end-September, only 254 units (14.8%) in the project remained unsold. The latest median price achieved was $1,712 psf. \u201cIf you look at the number [of unsold units] on its own, it sounds rather large,\u201d concedes Phylicia Ang, executive director of residential services at Savills Singapore. \u201cBut if you were to compare it with the total number of units they have sold to date [1,461], the project has done very well.\u201d D\u2019Leedon previewed in November 2010, and the project sold more than 500 units in the first phase. In November/ December 2012, the developer offered various packages with discounts of up to 10% for those who were either living or working nearby or whose children were attending schools in the vicinity. After the seventh round of property cooling measures were introduced in January last year \u2014 including hikes in additional buyer\u2019s stamp duty and a further reduction in borrowing limits for those buying their second or subsequent properties \u2014 the CapitaLand-led consortium made a bold move and within just days of the announcement, it launched a special promotion offering a discount of up to 15% to buyers of selected units. Also in January that year, it sold 263 units at a median price of $1,406 psf, making it a top-selling project that month. Now that the project is completed, expectations are that the developer will offer a special \u201ccompletion discount\u201d on units. In an email in response to queries from City & Country, CapitaLand says, \u201cWe will be launching our CapitaLand Designer Series with another marketing campaign that will be announced at a later date.\u201d The smallest units in d\u2019Leedon are one-bedroom and one-bedroomplus- study units, measuring 592 to 840 sq ft. There are also two-bedroom compact and two-bedroomplus- study units measuring 786 to 1,216 sq ft. Meanwhile, three-bedroom and three-bedroom-plus-study units measure 1,076 to 1,873 sq ft. Four-bedroom units measure 1,615 to 2,443 sq ft. There are also \u201cgarden houses\u201d spanning three levels, from the basement to the second level of the towers; they comprise four bedrooms, a private enclosed space including a garden and two basement parking spaces, and measure 3,703 to 6,534 sq ft. Meanwhile, the penthouses include duplexes and triplexes measuring 2,852 to 6,265 sq ft, and almost all come with a private swimming pool and roof terrace. The development has varied unit configurations, because of the curvature of the towers, as well as different levels of specifications. For example, the \u201cbasic\u201d units \u2014 typically the smaller one- and two-bedroom apartment types \u2014 will have ceramic tiles, Bosch kitchen appliances and laminated timber flooring in the bedrooms. The \u201cpremium\u201d units have compressed marble in the living and dining rooms, real timber flooring for the bedrooms, Miele kitchen appliances and Duravit sanitaryware, as well as a ceiling height of up to 3.5m. A basic one-bedroom-plus-study unit on the 34th floor is priced from $1.6 million ($2,036 psf), whereas a premium 2,260 sq ft, four-bedroom unit on the 24th floor of another tower is on offer for $3.6 million ($1,593 psf). \u201cThe pricing has always been reasonable and competitive in d\u2019Leedon,\u201d notes Savills\u2019 Ang. Besides the residential units, there are also eight commercial units, which will be leased to retail and F&B outlets to create a sense of vibrancy and community within the grounds. There is also a covered walkway to the Farrer Road MRT station. Rental pressureBy virtue of the number of units, property consultants foresee some pricing and rental pressure at d\u2019Leedon, and that is likely to affect condos in the vicinity. \u201cToday, the rental market is softening, owing to a combination of factors,\u201d says Savills\u2019 Wong. \u201cThere\u2019s more supply, fewer expatriate arrivals, more stringent criteria for employment pass application by the Ministry of Manpower, and expatriates\u2019 housing budgets have also been cut.\u201d The Farrer Road neighbourhood has many completed condos. For example, there is The Levelz, Capita- Land\u2019s freehold 126-unit private condo completed a decade ago. The project is located on Farrer Road across from d\u2019Leedon, and comprises mainly oneand two-bedroom units. One-bedroom units of 797 sq ft were recently listed for sale at $1.33 million ($1,692 psf), while asking rents are around $3,800 a month. Meanwhile, 1,001 sq ft, two-bedroom units are posting asking rents of $4,900 a month. In the vicinity is Waterfall Gardens, a 132-unit high-end freehold condo by MCL Land, and completed in 2010. The project comprises exclusively threeand four-bedroom apartments as well as penthouses. Three-bedroom units of 1,830 sq ft recently achieved rents of $7,000 to $8,000 a month, notes Savills\u2019 Wong. Meanwhile, 2,196 sq ft, four-bedroom units have been leased for $9,000 to $10,000 a month, down from $12,000 previously, she adds. Savills\u2019 Wong reckons owners at d\u2019Leedon may peg their one-bedroom units in the range of $3,000 to $4,000, with compact two-bedroom units possibly looking at asking rents of $3,800 to $4,500. She expects owners of three- and four-bedroom units at d\u2019Leedon to peg their asking rents closer to those at Waterfall Gardens. \u201cThe reality now is that investors who had purchased their units several years ago and were projecting a rental yield of 5% to 7% will now have to lower their expectations, possibly closer to the 3%-to-4% range,\u201d says a property agent who declines to be named. Adjacent to d\u2019Leedon is GuocoLand\u2019s 381-unit Leedon Residence at Leedon Heights. The freehold condo, designed by SCDA Architects, is pitched as a luxury condo. As at end-September, 145 units had been sold, with the latest median price at $1,953 psf. \u201cRight from the start, Leedon Residence and d\u2019Leedon had positioned themselves very differently,\u201d says Savills\u2019 Ang. \u201cSo, the completion of d\u2019Leedon, which is 99-year leasehold, should not affect the pricing of Leedon Residence, which is a freehold, luxury condo.\u201d Size mattersSeveral 99-year leasehold condos with more than 1,000 units have been completed over the last five to six years. The 1,111-unit The Sail at Marina Bay was completed in late 2008 and early 2009, when the global financial crisis hit. The 1,129-unit Reflections at Keppel Bay was completed in early 2011, and the 1,040-unit The Interlace at Telok Blangah was completed at end-2013. Incidentally, The Interlace is another project helmed by CapitaLand and Hotel Properties Ltd. Another development that was completed in 4Q2013 was Kheng Leong Developments\u2019 1,145-unit The Minton, located in the neighbourhood of Hougang and Lorong Ah Soo. D\u2019Leedon\u2019s number of units is still unsurpassed. In the Farrer Road area, the development will have an edge over the others, as most tenants prefer brand-new projects, says Chesterton\u2019s Han. \u201cThere will be some competition among the individual landlords within d\u2019Leedon to secure tenants,\u201d he concedes. However, CapitaLand\u2019s attempt to create value through product differentiation with a landmark development by Hadid has definitely set a new benchmark in Singapore. Its marketing efforts, such as a massive completion party with fireworks, laser show and an America\u2019s Got Talent star, as well as its designer series show units may stem the general downward pressure on rents and prices. Will market forces prevail in the long term? What will it mean for the project? \u201cWhatever happens, it will be an interesting development to watch in the next three to six months,\u201d says Savills\u2019 Wong.

According to sources, apartment units in one of two high-rise condominium blocks will be offered to them at prices equivalent to about RM1,000 psf. That is a substantial discount to recent launches in the area, and could have an adverse impact on developers with significant unsold units. \u201cAt RM1,000 psf, the pricing of Southern Marina will affect other projects in Puteri Harbour that were launched at higher prices of RM1,200 psf and above,\u201d reckons Ivan Hoh, managing director of PropNex International. Yet, the indicative pricing of Southern Marina could well be an appropriate level at which to move the units, amid growing signs that the once redhot Iskandar Malaysia market is now cooling. Donald Han, managing director of Chesterton Singapore, figures that prices in Puteri Harbour could now be heading back to the RM800 to RM1,000 psf range, where they were hovering in 2012. The companies behind Southern Marina are Kuok Brothers Group\u2019s Huge Quest Realty and Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional\u2019s Tanjung Bidari Ventures, which hold stakes of 70% and 30% respectively. Kuok Brothers holds a 60% stake in Huge Quest while the listed plantation group, PPB Group, holds the remaining 40%. Made up of about 400 apartments in total, the high-rise condo towers are part of a mixed-development with four blocks including office, serviced apartments, retail and F&B outlets with a total gross development value of RM1.5 billion ($589 million). The mixed-use scheme sits on a 5ha (about 12.5 acres) site adjacent to the upcoming convention centre and near the Custom & Immigration Quarantine Complex as well as the ferry terminal. The site was purchased last April from UEM Land Holdings for RM182 million, which translated into about RM334 psf. That was considered to be aggressive at the time, but property agents were expecting prices to continue heading north. Indeed, developers of properties in Puteri Harbour had been reporting strong take-up rates during the preceding months. In late-2012, the launch of UEM Sunrise\u2019s Teega saw queues snaking outside the showflat hours before it opened. Teega contains 736 condo units and 556 apartments, and all the units were sold out within three months, recounts Anne Tong, CEO of HSR Global. At the time, the development was priced at an average of RM700 psf. Encorp Marina, with 514 serviced apartments, was also launched in late-2012, with units reportedly sold at an average price of RM900 psf. Prices in the area then climbed quickly. Tiong Nam Properties\u2019 Pinetree, which contains a 26-storey condo tower with 264 units and a 26-storey hotel tower was officially launched in the middle of last year at prices ranging from RM977 to RM1,500 psf, according to property agents. A lot of the units were said to have been snapped up by Japanese groups. Adjacent to Pinetree is Puteri Cove Residences by a joint venture between two Singapore-based groups, Pacific Star Group and niche property developer DB2 Group. The project contains a total of 1,054 units in three 33-storey high-rise condominium towers. Another four low-rise blocks fronting the private marina contain a mix of 56 SOHOs and loft apartments. The first high-rise tower of Puteri Cove Residences previewed last October at prices of RM1,100 to RM1,200 psf. The second tower was launched in April this year at prices from RM1,180 to RM1,580 psf. Now, surging supply of new properties in Iskandar Malaysia as well as growing signs that interest rates will soon rise are affecting sentiment. According to Chesterton\u2019s Han, savvier developers have resorted to \u201cpackaging\u201d to boost the appeal of their projects. Some are exploring interest payment schemes with banks to help lower mortgage payments for buyers, while others are looking at offering sale-and-leaseback arrangements with rental guarantees of up to two years upon completion. \u201cA lot of people are concerned about oversupply, so this is a way to help alleviate that,\u201d he says. PropNex\u2019s Hoh agrees. \u201cPeople are also wondering if there will be enough businesses coming into Iskandar to generate employment to encourage people to live there, and fill the residential units,\u201d he says. Last year, Country Garden Holdings\u2019 Danga Bay project offered 9,600 units at one go. Priced at an average of RM900 psf, 30% to 40% of the units are said to be still unsold. Even R&F\u2019s Princess Cove project launched recently saw the first phase of 3,000 units released at prices in the range of RM900 to RM1,100 psf, notes Hoh. \u201cSo, it\u2019s hard for other developers to price their waterfront developments above those levels,\u201d he explains. Kuok Group and Khazanah appear to recognise that the market has shifted, and are now pricing units at Southern Marina to match the new environment. The closed-door weekend preview in Kuala Lumpur will be followed by another closed-door private preview for directors and business associates in Singapore the following weekend (Sept 27 and 28). No date for the public launch has been set yet. This article appeared in the City & Country section of Issue 644 (Sept 22) of The Edge Singapore."}], "max_tokens": 10}}
